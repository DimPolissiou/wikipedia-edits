Dublin - Ireland (5731078351).jpg|thumb|The [[Nissan Cherry|Datsun 100A]], after which the main car of the game is modeled.]]\n''My Summer Car'' is set in rural Finland during the summer of 1995, where the 19-year-old player character has the family home to himself while his parents are on holiday in [[Tenerife]]. The player has to assemble, restore and upgrade his father's dilapidated Satsuma AMP (modeled after the [[Nissan Cherry|Datsun 100A]]) using the car parts scattered inside the garage, as well as by purchasing new parts. To earn money for parts, the player can perform various countryside chores for neighbours such as delivering [[firewood]] on a [[tractor]]-pulled trailer, using a [[vacuum truck]] to empty their [[septic tank]]s, making [[kilju]] (Finnish [[Homebrewing|homebrew]] sugar wine) and selling it to an alcoholic neighbor, and picking up the aforementioned neighbor from the town pub in the early morning in exchange for a small sum of money.<ref name=\"rps\"/> After passing the Satsuma at the [[vehicle inspection]] office and installing the appropriate aftermarket parts (which can be obtained by mailing an order form to a parts dealer), the player's car is eligible to enter a weekly [[Folkrace|amateur rallying]] event for a chance to win a [[trophy]] and [[prize money]]. In addition, a computer can be bought in the local convenience store for recreational purposes only.\n\nBuilding the car is not obvious<ref name=\"22lifelessons\">{{cite web|url=http://steamed.kotaku.com/22-life-lessons-i-learned-from-a-permadeath-car-game-1788208794|title=22 Life Lessons I Learned From A Permadeath Car Game|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|publisher=}}</ref> as the player must literally build the car from the ground up. At the start of the game, the car is entirely disassembled down to the last [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]], and the player must place each part in its correct location, including bolting them in one-by-one with the correct size [[spanner]].<ref name=\"rps\"/> While most parts only fit together correctly, it is entirely possible to assemble the car wrong, e.g. leave out an engine [[gasket]] or a bolt, which will, in turn, lead to the failure of the vehicle. In addition to [[gasoline]], the car also requires maintenance of additional fluids, including [[motor oil]], [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator coolant]], and [[brake fluid]]s for the [[Hydraulic brake|brakes]] and [[clutch]], which deplete in use and time. The car can be damaged both externally and internally; the windshield can be broken and panels can be dented (the latter being repaired with a [[sledgehammer]] or through paying the local mechanic), while the engine can be damaged by things such as downshifting at high revs or careless usage of [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous oxide]].\n\nThe player also has access to various other pre-assembled vehicles that only require refueling as maintenance, such as a cargo van owned by his uncle that is capable of carrying large loads, a tractor and a septic truck (which is also owned by said uncle) for utilitarian uses, a [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] [[moped]], and a small two-stroke [[launch (boat)|launch]] at a nearby dock that allows for travel across the map's massive lake. Both the moped and the boat require two-stroke fuel, while the van, tractor and septic truck requires diesel. [[Fuel oil]] can also be used for diesel vehicles, though this will result in a fine by the police if caught. The local mechanic will also lend his [[muscle car]] while servicing the player's vehicle, but will trash the player's vehicle if the muscle car isn't returned in time. Finally, the player could win a dilapidated [[station wagon]] from a [[Twenty-One (card game)|ventti]] dealer infested with a wasp's nest. All of the player's road-going vehicles have the added ability to [[Towing|tow]] each other as well as salvageable car wrecks. High speed crashes will likely kill the player; the game optionally features [[permadeath]].<ref name=\"rps\"/> A small, lakeside cabin (serves as the second safe house) can be acquired by winning the bet against the local gambler, who also bets his own car as stated earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the player must also cater to various [[survival game]] aspects as balancing hunger, thirst and fatigue, but also unusual ones such as urine, stress, and dirtiness. For nutrition, the player can buy food and can drink beverages from the store, drink water directly from faucets or taps, and fatigue can be restored by sleeping or by making [[coffee]] or drinking it in a pub. Quite humorously, the player can freely urinate anywhere except when sitting in a vehicle. Be warned, as urinating in the house could result in an unremovable stain appearing on the floor of the house. Dirtiness can be decreased by taking a shower, or swimming in the nearby lake. Drinking too much beer (or hard liquor) will eventually get the player drunk, which first causes the player to waver and his vision to distort; further consumption of alcohol can lead the player to pass out and wake up at a random place on the map the next day. Stress can be alleviated by using a [[sauna]], drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, or other means such as successfully getting the Satsuma registered; failing to reduce stress to acceptable levels will eventually lead to a fatal heart attack. Police traffic stops randomly spawn along the main road of the in-game world, issuing fines for any traffic violations (speeding, failing to wear a seatbelt, drunk-driving, etc.); if the player fails to pay for a fine, police officers will eventually surround player character's home to arrest and imprison him in jail for a period of time scaled based on the cost of the fine.\n\nMuch of the game's originality comes from its irreverent tone:<ref name=\"22lifelessons\"/> The game's world is largely populated by low-class residents, many of whom are slovenly or drunkards, and the game includes [[drunk driving]]. There are three distinct buttons for [[Finnish profanity|cursing]] and [[the finger|flipping people off]] \u2013 none of which has any consequences other than the occasional response.<ref name=\"22lifelessons\"/> The game's dialogue is entirely in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], with English subtitles. The player may also save the game's progress at his [[toilet]] at home or at any of the [[outhouse]]s dotting the countryside,<ref name=\"rps\"/> which also serves to advance the in-game time to the next even hour. The game also features a minor backstory involving the drunkard neighbor who hid a suitcase full of two million [[Finnish markka|markkas]] in lottery winnings from his wife; if the player finds it and keeps it for himself, the same neighbor will eventually intrude into the player's house and attempt to murder the player with an axe. After that he is seen hung if the axe attack fails, citing a miserable life as his reason of suicide.\n\nThe game does not have Steam Workshop as of now, but modifications can be done by using Unity Asset Explorer, mostly texture modifications or with MSC loader (My Summer Car loader) for assets additives. Thanks to this, one can make their own car paint job, edit the rear window stickers and even change the appearance of other vehicles and buildings. There are also unofficial mods such as cars and objects made in [[Blender (software)|Blender]], two of the most notable are the [[VAZ-2102|Lada 1200 Station Wagon]] and Utesuma (Satsuma pickup) mod.\n\n==Development==\n''My Summer Car'' is primarily developed by a small independent development team consisting of Johannes Rojola (\"ToplessGun\"/\"RoyalJohnLove\") and Kaarina P\u00f6nkk\u00e4, as well as friends assisting in music and voiceovers. Closed development and beta testing of the game had been documented as early as the middle as 2013, with early snippets of development progress previewed on Rojola's [[YouTube]] channel and [[Twitter]] accounts. Development commentary hinted of the game intentionally designed to be a life simulator as well as a car simulator, with greater difficulty earning a living and owning, maintaining and driving the Satsuma on top of survival mechanics. The game would later be released as an [[early access]] game via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s[[Steam (software)#Steam_Greenlight | Greenlight]] program on October 24, 2016, and continues to be incrementally updated with new features and overhauls made available through its development branch and public updates.\n\n==Reception==\nWriting for ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'', Brendan Caldwell called the game \"Funny, detailed and thoroughly confusing\";<ref name=\"rps\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/11/07/my-summer-car-early-access-review/|title=Premature Evaluation: My Summer Car|first=Brendan|last=Caldwell|date=7 November 2016|publisher=}}</ref> while writing for ''[[Kotaku]]'', [[Nathan Grayson]] called the game \"Janky and weird as fuck, but fun\".<ref name=\"22lifelessons\"/> Both Caldwell and ''[[Eurogamer]]'''s Martin Robinson<ref name=\"eurogamer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-10-26-my-summer-car-is-the-most-hardcore-driving-game-yet|title=My Summer Car is the most hardcore driving game yet|first=Martin|last=Robinson|date=27 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref> compared the game's difficulty curve to ''[[Dark Souls]]''.\n\n''My Summer Car'' has also been the subject of praise from within the Finnish gaming community, winning the People's Choice Game of the Year 2016 \"Ky\u00f6pelit\" award in the 2017 {{ill|Finnish Game Awards|fi}},<ref name=\"SuomiAward17\">{{cite web|url=https://visionist.fi/2017/04/27/the-best-games-made-in-finland-were-awarded-at-the-finnish-game-awards/|title=The best games made in Finland were awarded at The Finnish Game Awards|date=27 April 2017|publisher=visionist.fi|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> and being inducted into the [[Finnish Museum of Games]] among the museum's 100 game entries in 2018.<ref name=\"vapriikki.fi\">{{cite web|url=http://vapriikki.fi/en/pelimuseo/pelit/|title=The Finnish Museum of Games > 100 Finnish Games|date=|publisher=Vapriikki Museum Centre|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://amistech.com/msc/}}\n\n[[Category:Upcoming video games]]\n[[Category:Early access video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:Permadeath games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Survival video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Vehicle simulation games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Finland]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Finland]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n", "text_old": " \n{{Infobox video game\n| title     = My Summer Car\n| image     = My Summer Car logo.jpg\n| caption   = ''My Summer Car'' header on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]\n| developer = Amistech Games\n| publisher = Amistech Games\n| designer  = Johannes Rojola<br>Kaarina P\u00f6nkk\u00e4\n| engine    = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]}}\n| genre     = [[Vehicle simulation game]], [[Survival game|survival]]\n| modes     = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n'''''My Summer Car''''' is an [[open world]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/digitoday/art-2000001939410.html |title=Suomalaisesta tietokonepelist\u00e4 tuli yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4 hitti \u2013 k\u00f6mpel\u00f6 ja ruma My Summer Car on ehtaa ys\u00e4ri\u00e4 |last=Kauppinen |first=Jukka O. |date=26 October 2016 |website=[[Ilta-Sanomat]] |publisher=[[Sanoma]] |language=Finnish |access-date=9 December 2016 |quote=Sit\u00e4 [My Summer Caria] voisi kuvailla jopa suomalaiskansalliseksi Grand Theft Autoksi, sill\u00e4 molemmat ovat '''[[:fi:Avoin pelimaailma|avoimen maailman]]''' hiekkalaatikkokohelluksia, joissa pelaajille on vapaat k\u00e4det touhuta.}}</ref> [[survival game]]<ref name=\"22lifelessons\" /> in development by [[Finland|Finnish]] developer Johannes Rojola of Amistech.

The film stars [[Ice Cube]], [[Charlie Day]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Dean Norris]], [[Christina Hendricks]], and [[Dennis Haysbert]].\n\nWhen school teacher Andy causes another teacher's termination, he is challenged to an after-school fist fight.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Los Angeles]] on February 13, 2017, was theatrically released in the United States on February 17, 2017, grossed $41&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|film|date=May 2018}}\nOn the last day before summer vacation, students devise an elaborate [[Senior Prank]]. Faculty members are trying to survive the chaotic day as best they can, but only the history teacher Ron Strickland is fierce enough to intimidate the students into behaving. Meanwhile, English teacher Andy Campbell is awaiting news of the birth of his second child with his wife Maggie. While teaching, Campbell is pulled aside by his school counselor friend Holly, to inform him of rumors of downsizing of all departments. Given his pregnant wife and child, this renders Campbell extremely anxious.\n\nAfter preventing Campbell from walking into a paint trap, Strickland asks for his assistance in using an outdated [[Audiovisual|AV system]] which keeps turning off after a couple of seconds. Campbell catches a student named Neil secretly using a remote control app on his [[smartphone]] to turn off the [[VCR]]. An infuriated Strickland grabs the phone and smashes it. Neil, using another classmate's phone, turns the TV off again and it enrages Strickland, who grabs a fire axe and destroys Neil's desk, sending the class screaming and panicking from the room.\n\nBoth Campbell and Strickland are brought to Principal Richard Tyler's office to discuss the matter. Strickland warns Campbell to keep his behavior a secret, but after Tyler threatens to fire them both if no one steps forward, Campbell tells the truth, resulting in the loss of Strickland's job. In retaliation, Strickland challenges Campbell to a fist fight after school.\n\nCampbell is convinced that he physically does not stand a chance against Strickland, and tries to set matters straight by asking Neil to share a false testimony to Principal Tyler in order to clear Strickland's name and have him reinstated. Neil agrees on the condition that Campbell buy him a [[MacBook Pro]]. After doing so, Campbell runs into Maggie and his daughter Ally who remind him to arrive promptly that afternoon for Ally's father-daughter talent show. Neil's false account is enough to convince Principal Tyler to reinstate Strickland.\n\nCampbell and Strickland receive an emergency call from Holly. The two meet up with her in a mock [[United Nations]] debate room and discover she tricked them into coming there so they could talk through their issues, with Holly acting as mediator. When Campbell tells Strickland that he was able to get him his job back, Strickland is further enraged, stating that Campbell should have told him about this plan before acting, and citing the mishandling of the school system. The fight is still on.\n\nCampbell tries to call [[9-1-1]] for help, but after telling the operator that he's a teacher and that another teacher wants to fight him, she hangs up on him after laughing at the situation. After seeking the advice of Holly and Coach Crawford, Campbell resolves to have Strickland removed from the campus before the day's end. As a last resort, Campbell threatens Neil into giving him the drug [[MDMA]]. As Principal Tyler finds his [[Toyota Prius]] vandalized and parked in the school's lobby, Campbell plants the MDMA in Strickland's satchel. Campbell calls the police in the hopes of having Strickland arrested, but the attempt is botched and both teachers are incarcerated.\n\nThe two teachers share a cell with other inmates, and Campbell goes across the cell and tricks an enormous inmate into giving Strickland a beating, but only when signaled. Campbell then returns to Strickland in order to trick him into giving the signal, but Strickland instead tells Campbell that the fight is called off after everything that they have been through the day. When the inmate nonetheless attacks Strickland, Strickland easily knocks him out. Upon realizing Campbell's actions, declares the fight back on. The two are then released after the police discover the drug used to frame Strickland was only [[aspirin]].\n\nCampbell heads back to the school to meet up with the school board, Tyler, and Superintendent Johnson, but learns that his colleagues have all been fired. Impatient after being told to wait for nearly an hour, Campbell barges into the meeting and learns that he is one of the few to remain at his position. However, Campbell stands his ground and voices his complaints about the public school system not receiving the respect and materials it truly needs. Campbell heads over to Ally's talent show, where Ally's rendition of [[Big Sean]]'s \"[[I Don't Fuck with You]]\" inspires him to finally stand up to Strickland.\n\nIn the school parking lot, Campbell and Strickland confront each other and engage in a frenzied fight that is dragged throughout the school and sees both men gaining the upper hand at different moments, and the fight goes throughout the entire school. Campbell briefly knocks Strickland out with a fire extinguisher and celebrates only to be sucker-punched by Strickland after he gets up. Strickland then answers Campbell's phone and learns that Maggie is about to give birth, at which point he shows mercy on Campbell and drives him to the hospital - thus ending the fight on friendly terms.\n\nThat summer, Tyler arrives at the Campbell household to tell Campbell that the publicity and public outcry the fight generated has put the Department of Education in a position where they need to put more effort and money into their schools, and must rehire Campbell and Strickland. Campbell accepts on the condition that the rest of his colleagues be reinstated as well. As the new school year begins, the faculty return to their respective positions. Campbell and Strickland, now best friends, are ready to enforce learning with Campbell being much more assertive towards the students.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Crawford is seen flirting with the 911 operator in person. After rapping for her, Crawford realizes that he doesn't know her name.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Ron Strickland,<ref name=\"Jun2015Deadline\"/> a hot-headed history teacher and Campbell's

The film stars [[Ice Cube]], [[Charlie Day]], [[Tracy Morgan]], [[Jillian Bell]], [[Dean Norris]], [[Christina Hendricks]], and [[Dennis Haysbert]].\n\nWhen school teacher Andy causes another teacher's termination, he is challenged to an after-school fist fight.\n\nThe film premiered in [[Fox Theater, Westwood Village|Los Angeles]] on February 13, 2017, was theatrically released in the United States on February 17, 2017, grossed $41&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|film|date=May 2018}}\nOn the last day before summer vacation, students devise an elaborate [[Senior Prank]]. Faculty members are trying to survive the chaotic day as best they can, but only the history teacher Ron Strickland is fierce enough to intimidate the students into behaving. Meanwhile, English teacher Andy Campbell is awaiting news of the birth of his second child with his wife Maggie. While teaching, Campbell is pulled aside by his school counselor friend Holly, to inform him of rumors of downsizing of all departments. Given his pregnant wife and child, this renders Campbell extremely anxious.\n\nAfter preventing Campbell from walking into a paint trap, Strickland asks for his assistance in using an outdated [[Audiovisual|AV system]] which keeps turning off after a couple of seconds. Campbell catches a student named Neil secretly using a remote control app on his [[smartphone]] to turn off the [[VCR]]. An infuriated Strickland grabs the phone and smashes it. Neil, using another classmate's phone, turns the TV off again and it enrages Strickland, who grabs a fire axe and destroys Neil's desk, sending the class screaming and panicking from the room.\n\nBoth Campbell and Strickland are brought to Principal Richard Tyler's office to discuss the matter. Strickland warns Campbell to keep his behavior a secret, but after Tyler threatens to fire them both if no one steps forward, Campbell tells the truth, resulting in the loss of Strickland's job. In retaliation, Strickland challenges Campbell to a fist fight after school.\n\nCampbell is convinced that he physically does not stand a chance against Strickland, and tries to set matters straight by asking Neil to share a false testimony to Principal Tyler in order to clear Strickland's name and have him reinstated. Neil agrees on the condition that Campbell buy him a [[MacBook Pro]]. After doing so, Campbell runs into Maggie and his daughter Ally who remind him to arrive promptly that afternoon for Ally's father-daughter talent show. Neil's false account is enough to convince Principal Tyler to reinstate Strickland.\n\nCampbell and Strickland receive an emergency call from Holly. The two meet up with her in a mock [[United Nations]] debate room and discover she tricked them into coming there so they could talk through their issues, with Holly acting as mediator. When Campbell tells Strickland that he was able to get him his job back, Strickland is further enraged, stating that Campbell should have told him about this plan before acting, and citing the mishandling of the school system. The fight is still on.\n\nCampbell tries to call [[9-1-1]] for help, but after telling the operator that he's a teacher and that another teacher wants to fight him, she hangs up on him after laughing at the situation. After seeking the advice of Holly and Coach Crawford, Campbell resolves to have Strickland removed from the campus before the day's end. As a last resort, Campbell threatens Neil into giving him the drug [[MDMA]]. As Principal Tyler finds his [[Toyota Prius]] vandalized and parked in the school's lobby, Campbell plants the MDMA in Strickland's satchel. Campbell calls the police in the hopes of having Strickland arrested, but the attempt is botched and both teachers are incarcerated.\n\nThe two teachers share a cell with other inmates, and Campbell goes across the cell and tricks an enormous inmate into giving Strickland a beating, but only when signaled. Campbell then returns to Strickland in order to trick him into giving the signal, but Strickland instead tells Campbell that the fight is called off after everything that they have been through the day. When the inmate nonetheless attacks Strickland, Strickland easily knocks him out. Upon realizing Campbell's actions, declares the fight back on. The two are then released after the police discover the drug used to frame Strickland was only [[aspirin]].\n\nCampbell heads back to the school to meet up with the school board, Tyler, and Superintendent Johnson, but learns that his colleagues have all been fired. Impatient after being told to wait for nearly an hour, Campbell barges into the meeting and learns that he is one of the few to remain at his position. However, Campbell stands his ground and voices his complaints about the public school system not receiving the respect and materials it truly needs. Campbell heads over to Ally's talent show, where Ally's rendition of [[Big Sean]]'s \"[[I Don't Fuck with You]]\" inspires him to finally stand up to Strickland.\n\nIn the school parking lot, Campbell and Strickland confront each other and engage in a frenzied fight that is dragged throughout the school and sees both men gaining the upper hand at different moments, and the fight goes throughout the entire school. Campbell briefly knocks Strickland out with a fire extinguisher and celebrates only to be sucker-punched by Strickland after he gets up. Strickland then answers Campbell's phone and learns that Maggie is about to give birth, at which point he shows mercy on Campbell and drives him to the hospital - thus ending the fight on friendly terms.\n\nThat summer, Tyler arrives at the Campbell household to tell Campbell that the publicity and public outcry the fight generated has put the Department of Education in a position where they need to put more effort and money into their schools, and must rehire Campbell and Strickland. Campbell accepts on the condition that the rest of his colleagues be reinstated as well. As the new school year begins, the faculty return to their respective positions. Campbell and Strickland, now best friends, are ready to enforce learning with Campbell being much more assertive towards the students.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Crawford is seen flirting with the 911 operator in person. After rapping for her, Crawford realizes that he doesn't know her name.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Ron Strickland,<ref name=\"Jun2015Deadline\"/> a hot-headed history teacher and Campbell's

Rubbo studied at [[Scotch College, Melbourne]], and read anthropology at [[Sydney University]], before travelling on a [[Fulbright scholarship]] to study film at [[Stanford University]], California where he got his MA in Communication Arts.

Hired by the NFB to make films for children, Rubbo directed over 40 documentaries, winning many international prizes. His best known documentaries are ''[[Sad Song of Yellow Skin]]'' (1972)) (filmed in Vietnam during the war), ''[[Waiting for Fidel]]'' (1973), ''Wet Earth and Warm people'' (a personal journey through Indonesia), ''[[Margaret Atwood: Once in August]]'' (1984), and a more recent documentary made after his NFB tenure, ''Much Ado About Something'' (2001)<ref name=\"Rubboprofile\"/>. ''Much Ado About Something'' explores the possibility that Christopher Marlowe was the hidden hand behind William Shakespeare. \"Rubbo marshals the evidence with lucidity and zest and comes to his own original and contentious conclusion\" - Suzy Baldwin, ''Sydney Morning Herald''\n\nWorking at the NFB, Rubbo was an early pioneer in the field of [[metafilm]], creating subjective, highly personal films that were more like personal journals than objective records of reality. \n''[[Sad Song of Yellow Skin]]'', Rubbo's reaction to the Vietnam war, is his most awarded film in this genre. That Rubbo should have pursued this vision at the National Film Board was particularly striking, as the NFB's English-language production branch had, during Rubbo's tenure, generally encouraged a much more objective approach to non-fiction film, including the use of [[Voice of God#media|voice-of-God narration]].<ref name=\"CFERubbo\">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Michael Rubbo | encyclopedia=Canadian Film Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Toronto International Film Festival]] | accessdate=14 June 2012 | url=http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/bios/michael-rubbo | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220141210/http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/bios/michael-rubbo | archivedate=20 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nHis films have been widely shown on TV; ''Much Ado About Something'' being repeated  several times on [[PBS Frontline]] Program which still sells the film. His work is also in the collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MOMA) New York and film schools around the world. He has been visiting lecturer at [[New York University]], [[UCLA]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Florida]] with longer teaching periods at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]] (AFTRS). In 1973, he helped found [[Film Australia]], an independent organization devoted to the promotion of Australian cinema.\n\nRubbo has also directed and written four children's feature films including ''[[The Peanut Butter Solution]]'' (1985), ''[[Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller]]'' (1988) along with its sequel ''[[The Return of Tommy Tricker]]'' (1994), and the [[Daytime Emmy]] award-winning film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' (1990). He spent some time as the Head of Documentaries at [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) Television, encouraging [[cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] and instigating the popular ''[[Race Around the World]]'' series.\n\n==Recent work==\nIn 2004, he made a documentary ''All about Olive'' about Australian centenarian [[Olive Riley]], which was shown on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. Born in 1899, Olive Riley went back to her birthplace, [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] to tell the story of her life. She helped them with the directing. After making ''All about Olive'', Mike helped her become the world's oldest blogger and [[YouTube]] video  poster, a title she held from 2006 to 2008, gaining fans around the world.\n\nWhilst Olive, who was given a co-directing credit failed to make it to the [[Guinness World Records]] as the world's oldest director, [[Jeanne Calment]], [[oldest people|the oldest human to have ever lived]] and another of Mike's stars, did make into the records book as the world's oldest actor. That was for her role, appearing as herself at the age of 114, in Rubbo's  'Vincent and Me'.\n\n==Publications==\nHe has recently published a book, '''Travels with My art''',  which draws together the two major threads in his  life, art and filmmaking, showing how they enrich each other.

Hired by the NFB to make films for children, Rubbo directed over 40 documentaries, winning many international prizes. His best known documentaries are ''[[Sad Song of Yellow Skin]]'' (1972)) (filmed in Vietnam during the war), ''[[Waiting for Fidel]]'' (1973), ''Wet Earth and Warm people'' (a personal journey though Indonesia), ''[[Margaret Atwood: Once in August]]'' (1984), and a more recent documentary made after his NFB tenure, ''Much Ado About Something'' (2001)<ref name=\"Rubboprofile\"/>. ''Much Ado About Something'' explores the possibility that Christopher Marlowe was the hidden hand behind William Shakespeare. \"Rubbo marshals the evidence with lucidity and zest and comes to his own original and contentious conclusion\" - Suzy Baldwin, ''Sydney Morning Herald''\n\nWorking at the NFB, Rubbo was an early pioneer in the field of [[metafilm]], creating subjective, highly personal films that were more like personal journals than objective records of reality. \n''[[Sad Song of Yellow Skin]]'', Rubbo's reaction to the Vietnam war, is his most awarded film in this genre. That Rubbo should have pursued this vision at the National Film Board was particularly striking, as the NFB's English-language production branch had, during Rubbo's tenure, generally encouraged a much more objective approach to non-fiction film, including the use of [[Voice of God#media|voice-of-God narration]].<ref name=\"CFERubbo\">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Michael Rubbo | encyclopedia=Canadian Film Encyclopedia | publisher=[[Toronto International Film Festival]] | accessdate=14 June 2012 | url=http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/bios/michael-rubbo | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220141210/http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/bios/michael-rubbo | archivedate=20 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\nHis films have been widely shown on TV; ''Much Ado About Something'' being repeated  several times on [[PBS Frontline]] Program which still sells the film. His work is also in the collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MOMA) New York and film schools around the world. He has been visiting lecturer at [[New York University]], [[UCLA]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Florida]] with longer teaching periods at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]] (AFTRS). In 1973, he helped found [[Film Australia]], an independent organization devoted to the promotion of Australian cinema.\n\nRubbo has also directed and written four children's feature films including ''[[The Peanut Butter Solution]]'' (1985), ''[[Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller]]'' (1988) along with its sequel ''[[The Return of Tommy Tricker]]'' (1994), and the [[Daytime Emmy]] award-winning film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' (1990). He spent some time as the Head of Documentaries at [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) Television, encouraging [[cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] and instigating the popular ''[[Race Around the World]]'' series.\n\n==Recent work==\nIn 2004, he made a documentary ''All about Olive'' about Australian centenarian [[Olive Riley]], which was shown on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. Born in 1899, Olive Riley went back to her birthplace, [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] to tell the story of her life. She helped them with the directing. After making ''All about Olive'', Mike helped her become the world's oldest blogger and [[YouTube]] video  poster, a title she held from 2006 to 2008, gaining fans around the world.\n\nWhilst Olive, who was given a co-directing credit failed to make it to the [[Guinness World Records]] as the world's oldest director, [[Jeanne Calment]], [[oldest people|the oldest human to have ever lived]] and another of Mike's stars, did make into the records book as the world's oldest actor. That was for her role, appearing as herself at the age of 114, in Rubbo's  'Vincent and Me'.\n\n==Publications==\nHe has recently published a book, '''Travels with My art''',  which draws together the two major threads in his  life, art and filmmaking, showing how they enrich each other.

[[Whipple Museum of the History of Science]], Cambridge, England.]]\n\nBabbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers. That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]], the Astronomer Royal.<ref name=\"Swade\">{{cite book |last=Swade |first=Doron |authorlink=Doron Swade |title=The Cogwheel Brain |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=London |isbn=978-0-316-64847-9 |year=2000 |page=186 }}</ref>\n\nBabbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to \u00a317,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.<ref name=\"Gleick\">{{cite book |author=Gleick, J. |title=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London |year=2011 |page=104 |title-link=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood }}</ref>\n\nWhile Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate [[Input/output|I/O]] unit.<ref name=\"Gleick\" />\n\n===Background on mathematical tables===\nIn Babbage's time, printed [[mathematical table]]s were calculated by [[human computer]]s; in other words, by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.<ref name=\"Th35\"/>\n\nAt Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion: {{blockquote|In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.<ref>[[B. V. Bowden]], ''Faster than Thought'', Pitman (1953), p. 8.</ref>}}\n\nThere was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by [[Gaspard de Prony]], and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 [[Charles Blagden]] was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&pg=PA110|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=110}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Coulston Gillispie|title=Science and Polity in France: The End of the Old Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPgIpRIvaSAC&pg=PA485|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=10 January 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2461-8|page=485}}</ref>\n\n===Difference engine===\n[[File:Babbage Difference Engine.jpg|thumb|The [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]'s Difference Engine No. 2, built from Babbage's design]]\n{{main|Difference engine}}\n\nBabbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of [[polynomial function]]s.

Clement worked to high standards, but his [[machine tool]]s were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them.

Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847\u20131849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,\"Difference Engine No. 2\", but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989\u20131991, using his plans and 19th-century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum, London, returning results to 31 digits.\n\nNine years later, in 2000, the Science Museum completed the [[computer printer|printer]] Babbage had designed for the difference engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/710950.stm |title=SCI/TECH &#124; Babbage printer finally runs |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Completed models====\nThe Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines according to Babbage's plans for the Difference Engine No 2.

For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to \u00a317,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.<ref name=\"Gleick\">{{cite book |author=Gleick, J. |title=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London |year=2011 |page=104 |title-link=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood }}</ref>\n\nWhile Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate [[Input/output|I/O]] unit.<ref name=\"Gleick\" />\n\n===Background on mathematical tables===\nIn Babbage's time, printed [[mathematical table]]s were calculated by [[human computer]]s; in other words, by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.<ref name=\"Th35\"/>\n\nAt Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion: {{blockquote|In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.<ref>[[B. V. Bowden]], ''Faster than Thought'', Pitman (1953), p. 8.</ref>}}\n\nThere was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by [[Gaspard de Prony]], and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 [[Charles Blagden]] was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&pg=PA110|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=110}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Coulston Gillispie|title=Science and Polity in France: The End of the Old Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPgIpRIvaSAC&pg=PA485|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=10 January 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2461-8|page=485}}</ref>\n\n===Difference engine===\n[[File:Babbage Difference Engine.jpg|thumb|The [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]'s Difference Engine No. 2, built from Babbage's design]]\n{{main|Difference engine}}\n\nBabbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of [[polynomial function]]s. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of [[finite difference]]s, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/Difference-Engine|title=Difference Engine {{!}} calculating machine|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFor a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in [[Joseph Clement]] to implement the design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his [[machine tool]]s were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=37291|title=Clement, Joseph|first=Anita|last=McConnell}}</ref>\n\nSome parts of the prototype survive in the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite journal | first = Denis | last = Roegel | title = Prototype Fragments from Babbage's First Difference Engine | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 31 | pages = 70\u201375 | date = April\u2013June 2009 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2009.31 }}</ref> This prototype evolved into the \"first difference engine.\" It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London.

Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847\u20131849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,\"Difference Engine No. 2\", but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989\u20131991, using his plans and 19th-century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum, London, returning results to 31 digits.\n\nNine years later, in 2000, the Science Museum completed the [[computer printer|printer]] Babbage had designed for the difference engine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/710950.stm |title=SCI/TECH &#124; Babbage printer finally runs |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Completed models====\nThe Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines according to Babbage's plans for the Difference Engine No 2.

Music Video Mode is a modified version of Story Mode that plays exactly like the Music Video with shorter levels, fewer enemies and a new move set for the Faderhead character. Revenge Mode gives access to the boss characters in a reversal of Story Mode where you must stop Faderhead from playing his concert.

The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.

The cabinet is not responsible for defense and security issues, as those are handled by the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]]. Thus, the security organizations such as the [[Korean People's Army]], [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]] and [[State Security Department]] report and subordinated directly to the SAC, whose Chairman holds full power as the supreme leader of the republic and the party and overall commander-in-chief of all uniformed forces. The Cabinet convenes a plenary meeting and an executive meeting.<ref>Article 121 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The plenary meeting consists of all the Cabinet members, while the executive meeting  is kind of a [[presidium]], and comprises fewer people, including the Premier, vice premier and other Cabinet members whom the Premier nominates. The cabinet forms [[Act (document)#Legislative Acts|acts]] in the form of decisions and directives.

and [[executive body]] and a general state-management organ in the [[Government of North Korea]].<ref>Article 123 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The Cabinet's principal newspaper is ''[[Minju Choson]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Park Hon-youn and Ather 1949.jpg|thumb|The cabinet, headed by [[Kim Il-sung]], visiting [[Moscow]] in 1949]]\nIn North Korea's first constitution, adopted in 1948, the executive powers were vested in the Cabinet, chaired by [[Kim Il-sung]] himself. The 1972 constitution saw the establishment of the post of [[President of North Korea]] which led the executive branch, and the cabinet was split into two organizations: The Central People's Committee and the State Administration Council. The Central People's Committee provided the highest visible institutional link between the government and the party and serves in effect as a de facto super-cabinet. The [[National Defence Commission]] was then sub-committee of this body.<ref>Article 105 of the 1972 Constitution</ref> The CPC's formal powers were all-inclusive and it was chaired by the President.<ref>Articles 100-106 of the 1972 Constitution of North Korea</ref> Among its responsibilities are formulating domestic and foreign policies, directing the work of the State Administration Council and its local organs, directing the judiciary, ensuring the enforcement of the constitution and other laws, appointing or removing the vice premiers and cabinet members, establishing or changing administrative subdivisions or their boundaries, and ratifying or abolishing treaties signed with foreign countries. The CPC also may issue decrees, decisions, and instructions. The State Administration Council was guided by the CPC and was led by a premier (chong-ri) and included vice premiers (bochong-ri), ministers (boojang), committee chairmen, and other cabinet-level members of central agencies. It was responsible for the formulation of state economic development plans and measures for implementing them, the preparation of the state budget, and the handling of other monetary and fiscal matters.<ref>A Country Study: North Korea- 1993- Library of Congress</ref>\n\n1982 saw the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces|People's Armed Forces]] and [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Public Security Ministries]] assigned directly to the President together with the State Inspection Commission.\n\nIn 1990, by a CPC decision, the NDC became fully independent from it as a separate institution, and 1992 constitutional amendments assigned it directly to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]. In 1998 amendments to the Constitution, the Central People's Committee and the State Administration were abolished, and the Cabinet was re-created. Thus, the Cabinet is not only the highest executive enforcement organ but was also expanded to become the general State management organ.\n\nEmphasizing its expanded role, on January 1999 Kim Jong-il stated that {{quote|\"The party organizations and party cadres should not intervene in administrative matters. The party should help the cabinet to be responsible for all economic affairs. Last year we made a new governmental system where the cabinet is supposed to be the control tower of the economy...No organizational unit should handle economic problems without consulting the cabinet\".<ref> Jae-Cheon Lim.

The cabinet is not responsible for defense and security issues, as those are handled by the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]]. Thus, the security organizations such as the [[Korean People's Army]], [[Ministry of People's Security (North Korea)|Ministry of People's Security]] and [[State Security Department]] report and subordinated directly to the SAC, whose Chairman holds full power as the supreme leader of the republic and the party and overall commander-in-chief of all uniformed forces. The Cabinet convenes a plenary meeting and an executive meeting.<ref>Article 121 of the Constitution of North Korea</ref> The plenary meeting consists of all the Cabinet members, while the executive meeting  is kind of a [[presidium]], and comprises fewer people, including the Premier, vice premier and other Cabinet members whom the Premier nominates. The cabinet forms [[Act (document)#Legislative Acts|acts]] in the form of decisions and directives.
