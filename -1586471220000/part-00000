These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]]. Later paroled [[POWs]] would also join the resistance.\n\n==Macabebe Scouts==\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Macabebe Scouts\n|image=\n|caption=\n|dates=1896\u20131901\n|country={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]]<br>{{small|(1896\u20131898)}}<br />{{flag|United States|1896}}<br>{{small|(1898\u20131901)}}\n|allegiance={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]]\n* {{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish East Indies]]<br>{{small|(1896\u20131898)}}\n{{flag|United States of America|1896}}\n* {{flagdeco|United States|1896}} [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Military Government]]<br>{{small|(1899\u20131901)}}\n|branch={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish Army]] (1896\u20131898)<br>\n{{army|United States}} (1899\u20131901)\n|type= [[Militia]], [[Irregular military|Irregulars]]\n|role= [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[reconnaissance]]\n|size= 1402 in December 1900<ref name=dum>{{cite web |last=Dumindin |first=Arnaldo |title=Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |url=http://www.filipinoamericanwar.com/thewarrages1899.htm |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|command_structure=\n|garrison=\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=\n|colors=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|equipment=\n|equipment_label=\n|battles=[[Philippine Revolution]]<br>[[Spanish\u2013American War]]<br>[[Philippine\u2013American War]]<br>[[Moro rebellion]]\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|disbanded=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1=\n|commander1_label=\n|commander2=\n|commander2_label=\n|commander3=\n|commander3_label=\n|notable_commanders=Col.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]]. Later paroled [[POWs]] would also join the resistance.\n\n==Macabebe Scouts==\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Macabebe Scouts\n|image=\n|caption=\n|dates=1896\u20131901\n|country={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]]<br>{{small|(1896\u20131898)}}<br />{{flag|United States|1896}}<br>{{small|(1898\u20131901)}}\n|allegiance={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]]\n* {{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish East Indies]]<br>{{small|(1896\u20131898)}}\n{{flag|United States of America|1896}}\n* {{flagdeco|United States|1896}} [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Military Government]]<br>{{small|(1899\u20131901)}}\n|branch={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish Army]] (1896\u20131898)<br>\n{{army|United States}} (1899\u20131901)\n|type= [[Irregular military|Irregulars]]\n|role= [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[reconnaissance]]\n|size= 1402 in December 1900<ref name=dum>{{cite web |last=Dumindin |first=Arnaldo |title=Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |url=http://www.filipinoamericanwar.com/thewarrages1899.htm |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|command_structure=\n|garrison=\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=\n|colors=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|equipment=\n|equipment_label=\n|battles=[[Philippine Revolution]]<br>[[Spanish\u2013American War]]<br>[[Philippine\u2013American War]]<br>[[Moro rebellion]]\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|disbanded=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1=\n|commander1_label=\n|commander2=\n|commander2_label=\n|commander3=\n|commander3_label=\n|notable_commanders=Col.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A. Pata, with the help of Associate Instructor Chris Schaefer of the [[University of Utah]], and narrated by [[Lou Diamond Phillips]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Forgotten Soldiers: A Film Recognizing the Bravery and Courage of WWII's Philippine Scouts |author=Malou Liwanag-Bledsoe |url=http://www.asianjournal.com/aj-magazine/something-filipino/17559-forgotten-soldiers-a-film-recognizing-the-bravery-and-courage-of-wwiis-philippine-scouts.html |newspaper=Asian Journal |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128075437/http://asianjournal.com/aj-magazine/something-filipino/17559-forgotten-soldiers-a-film-recognizing-the-bravery-and-courage-of-wwiis-philippine-scouts.html |archivedate=28 January 2013 }}</ref> The film received awards from the City of [[Los Angeles]], the [[California Senate]], [[County of Los Angeles]], and at the [[Beloit International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |title=City of LA recognizes Donald Plata for 'Forgotten' Soldiers |url=http://www.asianjournal.com/community/community-news/17827-city-of-la-recognizes-donald-plata-for-forgotten-soldiers-.html |newspaper=Asian Journal |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Philippine Scouts==\n* [[Vicente Barros]] \u2013 Major, U.S. Army, the only Filipino officer among the ranks of Americans during the formation of the [[Philippine National Guard]] in 1917.<ref>{{cite news |title=THE CORNERSTONE OF PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE: A Narrative Of Seven Years |author=Francis Burton Harrison |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/AFJ2343.0001.001/192 |pages=166 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}<br />{{cite book|author=Francis Burton Harrison|title=The Corner-stone of Philippine Independence|url=https://archive.org/details/cornerstonephil00harrgoog|year=1922|publisher=Century Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/cornerstonephil00harrgoog/page/n196 166]}}</ref> Became advisor to the Philippine Commonwealth militia, the National Volunteers of the Philippines in 1935.<ref>{{cite news |title=THE PHILIPPINE ARMY, 1935-1942 |author=Ricardo Trota Jose |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C&pg=PA13&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=barros&f=false |pages=21 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press (1992) |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Willibald C.

The [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] (Massport) operates the [[Port of Boston]], which includes a container shipping facility in [[South Boston]], and [[Logan International Airport]], in [[East Boston]].  The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) operates bus, subway, short-distance rail, and water ferry passenger services throughout the city and region.  [[Amtrak]] operates passenger rail service to and from major northeastern cities.  A major bus terminal at [[South Station]] is served by varied intercity bus companies.  The city is bisected by major highways [[Massachusetts Turnpike|I-90]] and [[Interstate 93 in Massachusetts|I-93]], the intersection of which has undergone a major renovation, nicknamed the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].\n\n== Road transportation ==\n\n=== Road infrastructure ===\nExcept for the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and part of the South Boston neighborhoods, Boston has no [[street grid]]. The City of Boston, composed of many smaller towns annexed over the years, retained most of the pre-existing street names, resulting in many duplicates throughout the city.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nExpressways and major arterial roads in and around Greater Boston are laid out with two circumferential expressways:  [[Interstate 495 in Massachusetts|Interstate 495]] and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]].  The circumferential routes are bisected by several radial highways that were planned to start in downtown Boston and proceed outward from the city.  In reality, the [[Central Artery]] was the only one of these radial expressways that was fully completed.  The [[freeway revolt]] of late 1960s prompted the governor of Massachusetts to halt construction on all remaining expressways within the Route 128 beltway, several of which were eventually replaced by rail lines.\n\nBy the early 1990s traffic on the elevated Central Artery was 190,000 vehicles per day, with an accident rate four times the national average for urban interstates. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper for six to eight hours per day, with projections of traffic jams doubling by 2010.  Also, the elevated structure itself was decaying, after more than a half century of continuous use.  For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, driving in Boston was disrupted by the [[Big Dig]], the most expensive (roughly $14 billion) road project in the history of the US.\n\nAfter more than 15 years of disruption, The Big Dig, along with other highway projects, provided less than 10 years of relief before congestion returned to the levels seen in \"prerecession 2005, when the Big Dig was almost complete and marketed as the solution to gridlock for commuters ... analyses would conclude that the added capacity attracted more drivers, and pushed the traffic bottlenecks farther into the suburbs.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Boston commute is as congested as it was 10 years ago|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/2015/09/17/zocommute/6oAfphVXJRcUJYM4RAFTWK/story.html\"|author=Katheleen Conti|work=Boston Globe| date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoston remains one of the most congested metropolitan areas in the US.

According to a ''[[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention]]'' magazine report in 2003, the city has the highest percentage of on-foot commuters of any city in the United States. In 2000, 13.36% of Boston commuters [[List of U.S. cities with most pedestrian commuters|walked to work]] according to the [[United States Census|US Census]]. This was the highest of any major US city, bested only by college towns such as nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. Most of the area's cities and towns have standing committees devoted to improvements to the bicycle and pedestrian environment. The first pedestrian advocacy organization in the United States, [http://walkboston.org/ WalkBoston], was started in Boston in 1990, and helped start the national pedestrian advocacy organization America Walks.\n\nCycling is popular in Boston, for both recreation and commuting. Some bicycle paths are marked on some roadways, but very few completely separated paths are available to cyclists.  The [[Minuteman Bikeway]] (which runs through several suburbs northwest of Boston) and the [[Charles River]] bike paths are popular with recreational cyclists and tourists. The [[Emerald Necklace]] system of parklands and parkways, pioneered by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his sons, provides some more pleasant alternative routes for cyclists.  The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] also provides [[cycling infrastructure]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/southwestCorr.htm|title=DCR web page.}}</ref> as does the [[East Boston Greenway]].<ref>http://www.bostonnatural.org/gwyeb.htm</ref> Many MBTA riders use a bicycle to get to a nearby station, and the number of bicycle racks and lockers has been increased.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://usingbicycles.blogspot.com/2008/04/mixed-mode-commuting-in-boston.html | title = Mixed-Mode Commuting in Boston  | work = Using Bicycles | author = Sherwood Stranieri | date = April 25, 2008 | accessdate = April 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHowever [[Bicycling (magazine)|''Bicycling'']] magazine, in its March 2006 issue, named the city as one of its three worst cities in the United States for cycling.<ref>{{cite journal|author=MacLaughlin, Nina |year=2006 |title=Boston Can Be Bike City...If You Fix These Five Big Problems |journal=The Phoenix \u2013 Bicycle Bible 2006 |url=http://thephoenix.com/supplements/2006/bicyclebible/article.aspx?ID=Boston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811055614/http://thephoenix.com/supplements/2006/bicyclebible/article.aspx?ID=Boston |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}</ref> The distinction was earned for \"lousy roads, scarce and unconnected bike lanes and bike-friendly gestures from City Hall that go nowhere\u2014such as hiring a bike coordinator in 2001, only to cut the position two years later\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-11,00.html |title=Urban Treasures |website=bicycling.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707032056/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-11,00.html |archivedate=July 7, 2007}}</ref> Neighboring [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] earned an honorable mention as one of the best cities for cycling with a population of 75,000-200,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html |title=Urban Treasures |website=bicycling.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206024029/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html |archivedate=February 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince September 2007, when Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] started a bicycle program called Boston Bikes with a goal of improving bicycling conditions by adding bike lanes and racks and offering bikeshare programs, the city has improved accommodations for bicyclists in a number of ways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/us/09bike.html |title=Boston Tries to Shed Longtime Reputation as Cyclists' Minefield |accessdate=August 16, 2009|author=Katie Zezima|work=The New York Times | date=August 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-2-13-17078-1,00.html|title=A Future Best City: Boston|accessdate=August 16, 2009|publisher=Rodale Inc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211195827/http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-2-13-17078-1,00.html |archivedate=February 11, 2010}}</ref> The least visible improvement is zoning and building code changes to encourage showering and locker facilities in major office buildings.

The MBTA was one of the earliest large transit agencies to embrace the [[Open Data]] philosophy, making route, scheduling, and [[real-time locating system|real-time]] vehicle location information publicly available in the standard [[General Transit Feed Specification|GTFS]] format.<ref name=MBTA-GTFS>{{cite web|last=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|title=Schedules and Trip Planning Data (GTFS)|url=http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/developers/|work=Rider Tools|publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref> As a result, many third-party apps are available on a number of hardware platforms, allowing riders a wide range of choices in obtaining travel information.<ref name=MBTA-Tools>{{cite web|last=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|title=App Showcase|url=http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/apps/|work=Rider Tools|publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>  Google Maps has started to present maps of the interiors of underground subway stations, and this information is available on Android and iOS smartphones, as well as web browsers.\n\n=== Buses ===\n\n[[Image:MBTA New Flyer C40LF.jpg|thumb|right|An MBTA bus boards customers at [[Downtown Crossing]].]]\n\n162 [[MBTA Bus]] routes operate within the Greater Boston area, with a combined ridership of approximately 375,000 one-way trips per day, making it the [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|seventh-busiest]] local bus agency in the country. Included within the MBTA system are four of the few remaining [[trolleybus|trackless trolley]] lines in the US (71, 72, 73 and 77A), although these principally operate in the adjoining city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. The bus fare is $1.70 with a [[CharlieCard]], or $2 with a CharlieTicket or cash; monthly commuter passes are available, as are reduced fare transfers between most bus lines and the subway.\n\nIn an effort to provide service intermediate in speed and capacity between subways and buses, the MBTA has begun projects using [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT) technology. The MBTA has one BRT line, the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], although this operates in two discontinuous sections. The Silver Line operates in part via dedicated trolleybus tunnel, in part via on-street reserved [[bus lane]]s, and in part mixed with general street traffic. Service through the trolleybus tunnel is by [[dual-mode bus]]es, which operate electrically in the tunnel and within a short section on the surface, and which use diesel power for the rest of the route.\n\n[[Massport]] operates the [[Logan Express]], an express bus service between Logan International Airport and suburban park-and-ride lots.\n\nSeveral privately owned commuter bus services take passengers between the city and suburbs.<ref>http://www.seaporttma.org/pdf/Commuter%20Bus%20Services%20available%20to%20Commuters%202010.pdf</ref>  Transportation Management Associations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masscommute.com/tma_directory/|title=MassCommute - MassCommute - List of MA TMAs|work=masscommute.com}}</ref> also run public shuttles to specific employment centers, such as the EZ Ride for [[Kendall Square]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/|title=Charles River TMA - Charles River TMA - Commuting Solutions|work=charlesrivertma.org}}</ref> and the Route 128 Business Council shuttles around Alewife, Needham, and Waltham;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://128bc.org/|title=128 Business Council \u2013 Unlocking the Grid|website=128bc.org}}</ref>  [[Partners HealthCare]] runs public shuttles among its locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partners.org/shuttle_schedules.aspx|title=Shuttle Services - Partners HealthCare|work=partners.org}}</ref>  The MASCO TMA operates six commuter shuttles for the use of [[Longwood Medical Area]] employees and students<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masco.org/directions/routes?ql=shuttles |title=Routes |accessdate=June 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506065308/http://www.masco.org/directions/routes?ql=shuttles |archivedate=May 6, 2015 }} lists shuttles between LMA and Ruggles, JFK/UMass, Crosstown (near Melnea Cass Blvd.), M6/Chestnut Hill, Landmark Center, and Fenway</ref> run by the MASCO TMA for the [[Longwood Medical Area]].

The city that sprung up around and away from the original North End neighborhood accommodates cars only awkwardly; parking comes at a premium throughout the city.  Off-street parking spaces have sold for more than $160,000 on Beacon Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/realestate/communities/profiles/2002/boston_beacon_hill.html|title=Boston.com / Real estate|work=boston.com}}</ref>  On-street parking is the norm in many sections, and the city created a resident permit parking program to reserve street space for permanent residents in certain neighborhoods.  The parking permits are free to Boston residents, however, and the program is overused; permitted spaces remain scarce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/08/22/is_parking_too_cheap/|title=Is parking too cheap?|work=boston.com}}</ref>  Meters citywide are priced at $1.25 per hour, and metered spaces are also often difficult to find.\n\nThe number of public parking spaces downtown has been capped since the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/environment/sbf.asp|title=Parking Freezes - City of Boston|work=cityofboston.gov}}</ref>  The number of parking spaces in East and South Boston, and the hours that they may be used, also is restricted by state regulation.  This is part of the state Department of Environmental Protection's plan, approved by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to address the non-compliance of the region with the mandatory [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] for [[ozone]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/region1/topics/air/sips/sips_ma.html EPA-Approved MA Regulations | State Implementation Plans (SIPs) | Topics | New England | US EPA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe MBTA operates several large [[park and ride]] facilities on its subway and commuter rail lines, close to major highways, providing access to downtown. While most of these tend to fill up with commuters on weekday mornings, they provide a good place for visitors to leave their cars and see the city without parking hassles on evenings and weekends.\n\n== Rail transportation ==\nBoston has two discrete rail networks. One of these, the MBTA, widely nicknamed \"the T\", includes elements of [[light rail]]/[[streetcar]] operation as well as traditional [[Rapid transit|subway]] technology. (The Red, Orange, Blue, and Green Lines have no physical rail interconnections with each other, though they are all operated by the MBTA and exchange passengers in shared stations.)  The second network forms the Boston area portion of the [[Rail transportation in the United States|North American rail network]], and provides commuter rail, intercity passenger rail and freight rail services.\n\nAlthough the two networks are essentially unconnected, they do in some places run alongside each other in the same right of way. Interchange stations allow interchange of passengers, but not trains, between subway and commuter rail services. Parts of the subway network also use former common user rail rights of way.\n\n=== Subway network ===\n{{main|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}\n[[Image:RedLineCharlesMGH.jpg|thumb|right|Red Line subway train crossing the [[Longfellow Bridge]]]]\n[[Image:Inbound train passing construction at Brigham Circle, March 2002.jpg|thumb|right|Green Line subway/surface train on street track]]\n[[Image:MBTA Blue Line train at Airport Station in 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Blue Line subway train at the airport]]\n[[Image:Southbound Orange Line train at North Station, February 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orange Line subway train at North Station]]\nBoston has the oldest subway system in North America, with the first underground streetcar traffic dating back to 1897. Today the whole subway network is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).\n\nIn the early 1960s, the then newly formed MBTA{{Dubious|The MBTA was a direct follow-on to the MTA, a reorganization, expansion, and renaming of an existing organization.|date=January 2016}} hired [[Cambridge Seven Associates]] to help develop a new [[brand identity]].  Cambridge Seven came up with a circled T to represent such concepts as \"transit\", \"transportation\" and \"tunnel.\" Today, Bostonians call their rapid transit network \"the T\", and it is the [[List of United States rapid transit systems by ridership|fourth busiest in the country]], with daily ridership of 549,000 trips excluding the Silver Line bus.<ref>American Public Transportation Association, [http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1hr.pdf Heavy Rail Transit Ridership Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810084851/http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1hr.pdf |date=August 10, 2007 }}, First Quarter 2007.</ref> This compares with the [[Washington Metro]]'s 910,100, the [[Chicago 'L']]'s 596,300, and Los Angeles's 126,900, but is overshadowed by [[NYCTA|New York City]]'s 6.0 million average daily weekday trips.\n\nThe one-way fare is $2.40 with a [[CharlieCard]] or $2.90 if paid with a CharlieTicket or cash. Monthly commuter passes, and day and week visitor's passes are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mbta.com/fares#bus_subway_overview |website=Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority |title=Fares Overview |accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref> There are four [[rapid transit|subway]] lines in the metropolitan Boston area: the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]], [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green&nbsp;Line]], [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]], and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]. The colors of each line have a symbolic meaning: the Blue Line runs under Boston Harbor; the Red Line used to terminate at [[Harvard University]] (whose school color is [[crimson]]); the Orange Line used to run along Washington Street, which was once called Orange Street; and the Green Line runs along parts of the [[Emerald Necklace]] into the leafy suburbs of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Throwback Thursday: When the T Was Color-Coded |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2016/08/25/mbta-color-history/ |website=Boston Magazine |accessdate=January 4, 2019|date=August 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe Green Line is actually four different lines; it starts as one trunk line but then splits into four different branches, the [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|B]] (Boston College), [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|C]] (Cleveland Circle), [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|D]] (Riverside) and [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|E]] (Heath Street) trains. Because the split is only relevant on the outbound direction of travel, one may take any train inbound, but when going outbound one must be careful to board the correct train. The Red Line splits as well, with southbound trains going either to Braintree or Ashmont.\n\nThough most of Boston's [[rapid transit]] network is powered via [[third rail]], the outermost portions of the Blue Line, as well as all of the Green Line and [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]], are powered via [[overhead lines]]. The name \"subway\" is something of a misnomer; as with other systems, large segments run above ground when far from the city's downtown.  Additionally, the Green and Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Lines are technically [[light-rail]] services, using [[Light rail vehicle|LRV]]s and [[streetcars]] rather than typical [[multiple unit]] heavy railcar equipment. The Ashmont-Mattapan line uses refurbished classic pre-war \"[[PCC streetcar|PCC]]\" trolleys on an exclusive right of way; the Green Line relies on modern high-capacity [[Light rail|LRV]] cars from Japan and Italy.\n\nLike the [[New York City Subway]], Boston's subway system in theory does keep to an exact fixed schedule. Starting around 2011, the MBTA introduced overhead displays at the train platform level which indicate estimated arrival times for the next two trains in each direction.  In addition, real-time information about train location (and bus location) is available via an [[Open Data]] protocol on the Internet, enabling a large number of third-party smartphone apps and web sites to display expected arrival times throughout the MBTA system.  The Green Line relies more on operators than its signal system compared to other lines, especially where trams are driven across or even in automobile lanes on surface rails.  Due to a sparsity of data collected by the existing system, real-time Green Line arrival predictions are not expected until tracking infrastructure upgrades are completed in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/allston_brighton/2013/01/mbta_mobile_apps_will_be_able.html|title=MBTA: Mobile apps will be able to track Green Line trains by 2015|work=Boston.com|date=January 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Elevated sections====\nDespite the first rapid transit segment being built underground, many later parts were built as [[elevated railway]]s.{{dubious|this implies a major separation in time; the first elevated was only 4 years later|date=January 2016}} A century later, most of these elevated railway sections have been replaced by [[Cut (earthmoving)|cut]] or tunnel routing.  The only remaining classic elevated structures are the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]'s [[Lechmere Viaduct]], including the [[Science Park (MBTA station)|Science Park]] station, and a short segment of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Charles-MGH (MBTA station)|Charles-MGH]], connecting the tunnel under [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] to the [[Longfellow Bridge]].\n\nThe [[Boston Elevated Railway]] was the company that owned all the elevateds and subways. The following Els once existed:\n*[[Causeway Street Elevated]] (closed 2004), from the [[Haymarket Incline]] to the [[Lechmere Viaduct]]\n*[[Washington Street Elevated]] (closed 1987), from [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills]] to an incline north of the [[Masspike]]\n*[[Charlestown Elevated]] (closed April 4, 1975), from the [[Haymarket Incline]] to [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]]\n*[[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] (closed 1938), from the Washington Street El at the [[Castle Street Wye]] at Herald Street (Tower 'D') to the Charlestown El and Causeway Street El at [[North Station]] (Tower 'C')\n\n=== Common user rail network ===\nUnlike the subway, which is owned and operated by the MBTA, the common user network is owned and operated by a mixture of various public and private sector bodies. In the Boston area, trackage is owned by a mixture of the MBTA and several freight railroads. Commuter rail services are operated by the [[Keolis]] Commuter Services (KCS)<ref>http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=6442451214&month=1&year=14 MBTA press release on Keolis Commuter Services award</ref> under contract to the MBTA, intercity passenger services are operated by [[Amtrak]], and freight services are operated by the various freight railroads.

There are approximately 125,000 one-way trips on the commuter rail each day, making it the [[List of United States commuter rail systems by ridership|fifth-busiest]] commuter rail system in the country, outranked only by the various systems serving New York and Chicago suburbs.\n\nThere are two major [[rail terminal]]s in Boston: [[North Station]] and [[South Station]]. Commuter rail lines from the North Shore and northwestern suburbs begin and terminate at North Station; lines from the South Shore and the west start and end at South Station. There is no direct rail connection between North Station and South Station, so that interchange between the two stations generally requires the use of two different subway lines (Red/Orange or Red/Green).  However, passengers on commuter lines serving [[Back Bay (MBTA station)|Back Bay Station]] can interchange directly from there to North Station using the Orange Line, and passengers on the [[Fitchburg Line]] can interchange directly from [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter]] to South Station using the Red Line.\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n[[Image:Acela Regional in Boston South Station.jpg|thumb|''Northeast Regional'' train at South Station. The ''Acela'' name on the locomotive dates from the period when these trains were branded ''Acela Regional''.]]\nBoston is served by four intercity rail services, all operated by [[Amtrak]]. The ''[[Acela Express]]'' and ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' services both operate on the [[Northeast Corridor]] to and from [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] A branch of the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' service operates to and from [[Chicago]].

The ''Downeaster'' service terminates at North Station, primarily because the ''Downeaster'' Amtrak line is intended for points north of downtown. The Northeast Corridor and ''Lake Shore Limited'' services also stop at [[Back Bay station]]. The lack of a direct rail connection between North Station and South Station means that passengers transferring to and from the ''Downeaster'' are faced with a transfer between stations. Although most such transfers can be achieved using the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] between Back Bay and North Station, Amtrak recommends passengers with luggage to use a taxi.<ref name=\"amra\"/><ref name=amrade>{{cite web | title = Routes - Northeast - Downeaster | url = http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Vertical_Route_Page&c=am2Route&cid=1081256321869&ssid=134 | publisher = Amtrak | accessdate = June 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Boston area, most Amtrak services operate over commuter rail track owned by the MBTA, who also own the Northeast Corridor track as far as the [[Rhode Island]] state line.<ref name=\"sppnemc\"/>\n\n==== Freight rail ====\n[[CSX Transportation|CSX]] is the only [[class I railroad]] serving the Boston area, which it reaches by its [[Boston Subdivision]] line to [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and by [[trackage rights]] over the Northeast Corridor. CSX also has trackage rights over much of the southern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In February 2013, CSX moved freight operations from its Beacon Park Yard in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]<ref name=\"sppnemc\"/> to a newly refurbished [[Double-stack rail transport|double stack intermodal yard]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and a new [[transload]] facility in [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westborough]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-the-governor|title=Office of Governor Charlie Baker and Lt.

PAR is a [[class II railroad]] that operates lines to the north and west of Boston, reaching destinations in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] as well as Massachusetts. It also has trackage rights over much of the northern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In May 2008, PAR announced a venture with [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] to create a jointly owned freight corridor, branded the [[Patriot Corridor]], linking Boston to a newly refurbished intermodal yard in [[Mechanicville, New York]], just north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]].<ref name=\"sppnemc\"/><ref name=parnspc>{{cite web | publisher = Norfolk Southern Corp. | url = http://www.nscorp.com/nscportal/nscorp/Media/News%20Releases/2008/news051508_2.html | title = Pan Am Railways and Norfolk Southern Create the Patriot Corridor to Improve Rail Service and Expand Capacity in New York and New England | date = May 15, 2008 | accessdate = June 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOnly a few rail freight customers remain in or near Boston, including a chemical packager in Allston, and food distribution facilities and a scrap metal processor in [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]].

It was historically important for the growth of the city, and was originally located in what is now the downtown area of the city. Land reclamation and conversion to other uses means that downtown area no longer handles commercial traffic, although the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] maintains a major base there, and there is still considerable ferry and leisure usage.\n\nToday the principal cargo handling facilities are located in the Boston neighborhoods of [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], [[East Boston]], and [[South Boston]], and in the neighbouring city of [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]]. In 2011, the port handled over 11.5 million [[metric ton]]s of cargo, including 192,000 [[Containerization|container]] [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEUs]].

One of these is an inner harbor service, linking the downtown waterfront with [[Boston Navy Yard]] in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]]. The other routes are commuter routes, linking downtown to [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]. Some commuter services connect via [[Logan International Airport]]. All services are operated by [[private sector]] companies under contract to the MBTA.\n\nOutside the MBTA system, seasonal passenger ferry services operate to the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area|Boston Harbor Islands]], to the city of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and to the city of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] on [[Cape Cod]]. [[Water taxi]]s provide on-demand service from various points on the downtown waterfront and from [[Logan International Airport|Logan Airport]], and in particular between the airport and downtown.\n\nSeveral companies operate tourist oriented cruise boats on the harbor and on the [[Charles River]]. Other companies operate [[duck tour]]s that use amphibious vehicles (mostly derived from World War II era [[DUKW]]s), and encompass both the city's streets and its waterways. On a much smaller scale, but perhaps more [[cultural icon|iconic]] of Boston, are the human-powered [[Swan Boats (Boston, Massachusetts)|Swan Boats]] on the lake of the city's [[Public Garden (Boston, Massachusetts)|Public Garden]].\n\n==Public transportation statistics==\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Boston, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 83 min. 29% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 15 minutes, while 24% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7&nbsp;km, while 12% travel for over 12&nbsp;km in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boston Public Transportation Statistics|publisher= Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_USA_Boston_MA-141|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>\n\n==Aviation==\n{{see also|Massachusetts Port Authority|List of airports in the Boston area}}\n\n[[Image:KBOS Aerial NGS.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photograph of Logan International Airport. Downtown Boston is at bottom left corner of this image.]]\nBoston's principal airport is [[Logan International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|BOS]]), situated in [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]] just across inner [[Boston Harbor]] from downtown Boston. Logan Airport is  operated by [[Massport]] and has extensive domestic and international airline service. Logan Airport is linked to downtown by several highway tunnels. The [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[bus rapid transit]] uses these to connect Logan air terminals with [[South Station]]. There are also shuttle buses between the terminals and the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]] [[Airport (MBTA station)|Airport station]].\n\nTo help address overcrowding at Logan Airport, Massport operates two other airports in eastern Massachusetts:\n* [[Hanscom Field|L.G.

Green Airport to Boston.\n\nThere are also several [[general aviation]] facilities for private planes in the Boston area, including [[Hanscom Field]], [[Norwood Memorial Airport]] and [[Beverly Municipal Airport]].\n\nSince the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], strict security has been implemented at all of Boston's airports. Because of this and its location as the closest American port to Europe, Boston is an emergency destination for airliners that experience security or mechanical problems while en route to the US, although they may also be diverted to [[City of Halifax|Halifax (Nova Scotia)]], or other Canadian airports.\n\n==Boston Vision Zero Plan==\n\nIn 2015, mayor [[Marty Walsh (politician)]]  announced that the city of [[Boston]] would become part of a worldwide program known as [[Vision Zero]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Vision Zero is a plan self described as \u201ca new standard for safety on our streets.\u201d The plan aims to eliminate deaths caused by transportation, whether that be pedestrians, personal vehicle riders, or cyclists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visionzerocoalition.org/what_is_vision_zero|title=What is Vision Zero?|website=Massachusetts Vision Zero Coalition|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, the city of Boston has adopted several different policies aimed to help bring down the number of fatalities caused by Transportation in Boston.

The [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] (Massport) operates the [[Port of Boston]], which includes a container shipping facility in [[South Boston]], and [[Logan International Airport]], in [[East Boston]].  The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) operates bus, subway, short distance rail, and water ferry passenger services throughout the city and region.  [[Amtrak]] operates passenger rail service to and from major northeastern cities.  A major bus terminal at [[South Station]] is served by varied intercity bus companies.  The city is bisected by major highways [[Massachusetts Turnpike|I-90]] and [[Interstate 93 in Massachusetts|I-93]], the intersection of which has undergone a major renovation, nicknamed the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]].\n\n== Road transportation ==\n\n=== Road infrastructure ===\nExcept for the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] and part of the South Boston neighborhoods, Boston has no [[street grid]]. The City of Boston, composed of many smaller towns annexed over the years, retained most of the pre-existing street names, resulting in many duplicates throughout the city.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nExpressways and major arterial roads in and around Greater Boston are laid out with two circumferential expressways:  [[Interstate 495 in Massachusetts|Interstate 495]] and [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]].  The circumferential routes are bisected by several radial highways that were planned to start in downtown Boston and proceed outward from the city.  In reality, the [[Central Artery]] was the only one of these radial expressways that was fully completed.  The [[freeway revolt]] of late 1960s prompted the governor of Massachusetts to halt construction on all remaining expressways within the Route 128 beltway, several of which were eventually replaced by rail lines.\n\nBy the early 1990s traffic on the elevated Central Artery was 190,000 vehicles per day, with an accident rate four times the national average for urban interstates. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper for six to eight hours per day, with projections of traffic jams doubling by 2010.  Also, the elevated structure itself was decaying, after more than a half century of continuous use.  For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, driving in Boston was disrupted by the [[Big Dig]], the most expensive (roughly $14 billion) road project in the history of the US.\n\nAfter more than 15 years of disruption, The Big Dig, along with other highway projects, provided less than 10 years of relief before congestion returned to the levels seen in \"prerecession 2005, when the Big Dig was almost complete and marketed as the solution to gridlock for commuters ... analyses would conclude that the added capacity attracted more drivers, and pushed the traffic bottlenecks farther into the suburbs.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Boston commute is as congested as it was 10 years ago|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/2015/09/17/zocommute/6oAfphVXJRcUJYM4RAFTWK/story.html\"|author=Katheleen Conti|work=Boston Globe| date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBoston remains one of the most congested metropolitan areas in the US.  The complex and still-changing road network, with many one-way streets and time-based traffic restrictions, has led many Boston travelers to consider an up-to-date [[GPS navigation]] map system a necessity.\n\n=== Walking and bicycling ===\n[[File:USCommutePatterns2006(2).png|thumb|right|500px|Compared to residents of other American cities, Bostonians have shorter commute times than many and use public transit more than most.]]\n\nBoston is known to travel agents as \"America's Walking City\", has been rated as the third most [[walkability|walkable]] city in the US by [[Walk Score]], and also has a high Transit Score.<ref name=WalkScore>{{cite web|last=Walk Score|title=About Boston|url=http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Boston|work=Walk Score|publisher=Walk Score|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBoston is a compact city, sized right for walking or bicycling. According to a ''[[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention]]'' magazine report in 2003, the city has the highest percentage of on-foot commuters of any city in the United States. In 2000, 13.36% of Boston commuters [[List of U.S. cities with most pedestrian commuters|walked to work]] according to the [[United States Census|US Census]]. This was the highest of any major US city, bested only by college towns such as nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. Most of the area's cities and towns have standing committees devoted to improvements to the bicycle and pedestrian environment. The first pedestrian advocacy organization in the United States, [http://walkboston.org/ WalkBoston], was started in Boston in 1990, and helped start the national pedestrian advocacy organization America Walks.\n\nCycling is popular in Boston, for both recreation and commuting. Some bicycle paths are marked on some roadways, but very few completely separated paths are available to cyclists.  The [[Minuteman Bikeway]] (which runs though several suburbs northwest of Boston) and the [[Charles River]] bike paths are popular with recreational cyclists and tourists. The [[Emerald Necklace]] system of parklands and parkways, pioneered by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his sons, provides some more pleasant alternative routes for cyclists.  The [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] also provides [[cycling infrastructure]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/southwestCorr.htm|title=DCR web page.}}</ref> as does the [[East Boston Greenway]].<ref>http://www.bostonnatural.org/gwyeb.htm</ref> Many MBTA riders use a bicycle to get to a nearby station, and the number of bicycle racks and lockers has been increased.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://usingbicycles.blogspot.com/2008/04/mixed-mode-commuting-in-boston.html | title = Mixed-Mode Commuting in Boston  | work = Using Bicycles | author = Sherwood Stranieri | date = April 25, 2008 | accessdate = April 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHowever [[Bicycling (magazine)|''Bicycling'']] magazine, in its March 2006 issue, named the city as one of its three worst cities in the United States for cycling.<ref>{{cite journal|author=MacLaughlin, Nina |year=2006 |title=Boston Can Be Bike City...If You Fix These Five Big Problems |journal=The Phoenix \u2013 Bicycle Bible 2006 |url=http://thephoenix.com/supplements/2006/bicyclebible/article.aspx?ID=Boston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811055614/http://thephoenix.com/supplements/2006/bicyclebible/article.aspx?ID=Boston |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}</ref> The distinction was earned for \"lousy roads, scarce and unconnected bike lanes and bike-friendly gestures from City Hall that go nowhere\u2014such as hiring a bike coordinator in 2001, only to cut the position two years later\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-11,00.html |title=Urban Treasures |website=bicycling.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707032056/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-11,00.html |archivedate=July 7, 2007}}</ref> Neighboring [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] earned an honorable mention as one of the best cities for cycling with a population of 75,000-200,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html |title=Urban Treasures |website=bicycling.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206024029/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-2-16-14593-9,00.html |archivedate=February 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince September 2007, when Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] started a bicycle program called Boston Bikes with a goal of improving bicycling conditions by adding bike lanes and racks and offering bikeshare programs, the city has improved accommodations for bicyclists in a number of ways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/us/09bike.html |title=Boston Tries to Shed Longtime Reputation as Cyclists' Minefield |accessdate=August 16, 2009|author=Katie Zezima|work=The New York Times | date=August 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-2-13-17078-1,00.html|title=A Future Best City: Boston|accessdate=August 16, 2009|publisher=Rodale Inc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211195827/http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-2-13-17078-1,00.html |archivedate=February 11, 2010}}</ref> The least visible improvement is zoning and building code changes to encourage showering and locker facilities in major office buildings.

Included within the MBTA system are four of the few remaining [[trolleybus|trackless trolley]] lines in the US (71, 72, 73 and 77A), although these principally operate in the adjoining city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. The bus fare is $1.70 with a [[CharlieCard]], or $2 with a CharlieTicket or cash; monthly commuter passes are available, as are reduced fare transfers between most bus lines and the subway.\n\nIn an effort to provide service intermediate in speed and capacity between subways and buses, the MBTA has begun projects using [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT) technology. The MBTA has one BRT line, the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], although this operates in two discontinuous sections. The Silver Line operates in part via dedicated trolleybus tunnel, in part via on-street reserved [[bus lane]]s, and in part mixed with general street traffic. Service through the trolleybus tunnel is by [[dual-mode bus]]es, which operate electrically in the tunnel and within a short section on the surface, and which use diesel power for the rest of the route.\n\n[[Massport]] operates the [[Logan Express]], an express bus service between Logan International Airport and suburban park-and-ride lots.\n\nSeveral privately owned commuter bus services take passengers between the city and suburbs.<ref>http://www.seaporttma.org/pdf/Commuter%20Bus%20Services%20available%20to%20Commuters%202010.pdf</ref>  Transportation Management Associations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masscommute.com/tma_directory/|title=MassCommute - MassCommute - List of MA TMAs|work=masscommute.com}}</ref> also run public shuttles to specific employment centers, such as the EZ Ride for [[Kendall Square]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/|title=Charles River TMA - Charles River TMA - Commuting Solutions|work=charlesrivertma.org}}</ref> and the Route 128 Business Council shuttles around Alewife, Needham, and Waltham;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://128bc.org/|title=128 Business Council \u2013 Unlocking the Grid|website=128bc.org}}</ref>  [[Partners HealthCare]] runs public shuttles among its locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.partners.org/shuttle_schedules.aspx|title=Shuttle Services - Partners HealthCare|work=partners.org}}</ref>  The MASCO TMA operates six commuter shuttles for the use of [[Longwood Medical Area]] employees and students<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masco.org/directions/routes?ql=shuttles |title=Routes |accessdate=June 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506065308/http://www.masco.org/directions/routes?ql=shuttles |archivedate=May 6, 2015 }} lists shuttles between LMA and Ruggles, JFK/UMass, Crosstown (near Melnea Cass Blvd.), M6/Chestnut Hill, Landmark Center, and Fenway</ref> run by the MASCO TMA for the [[Longwood Medical Area]].

The city that sprung up around and away from the original North End neighborhood accommodates cars only awkwardly; parking comes at a premium throughout the city.  Off-street parking spaces have sold for more than $160,000 on Beacon Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/realestate/communities/profiles/2002/boston_beacon_hill.html|title=Boston.com / Real estate|work=boston.com}}</ref>  On-street parking is the norm in many sections, and the city created a resident permit parking program to reserve street space for permanent residents in certain neighborhoods.  The parking permits are free to Boston residents, however, and the program is overused; permitted spaces remain scarce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/08/22/is_parking_too_cheap/|title=Is parking too cheap?|work=boston.com}}</ref>  Meters citywide are priced at $1.25 per hour, and metered spaces are also often difficult to find.\n\nThe number of public parking spaces downtown has been capped since the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/environment/sbf.asp|title=Parking Freezes - City of Boston|work=cityofboston.gov}}</ref>  The number of parking spaces in East and South Boston, and the hours that they may be used, also is restricted by state regulation.  This is part of the state Department of Environmental Protection's plan, approved by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to address the non-compliance of the region with the mandatory [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] for [[ozone]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/region1/topics/air/sips/sips_ma.html EPA-Approved MA Regulations | State Implementation Plans (SIPs) | Topics | New England | US EPA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe MBTA operates several large [[park and ride]] facilities on its subway and commuter rail lines, close to major highways, providing access to downtown. While most of these tend to fill up with commuters on weekday mornings, they provide a good place for visitors to leave their cars and see the city without parking hassles on evenings and weekends.\n\n== Rail transportation ==\nBoston has two discrete rail networks. One of these, the MBTA, widely nicknamed \"the T\", includes elements of [[light rail]]/[[streetcar]] operation as well as traditional [[Rapid transit|subway]] technology. (The Red, Orange, Blue, and Green Lines have no physical rail interconnections with each other, though they are all operated by the MBTA and exchange passengers in shared stations.)  The second network forms the Boston area portion of the [[Rail transportation in the United States|North American rail network]], and provides commuter rail, intercity passenger rail and freight rail services.\n\nAlthough the two networks are essentially unconnected, they do in some places run alongside each other in the same right of way. Interchange stations allow interchange of passengers, but not trains, between subway and commuter rail services. Parts of the subway network also use former common user rail rights of way.\n\n=== Subway network ===\n{{main|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority}}\n[[Image:RedLineCharlesMGH.jpg|thumb|right|Red Line subway train crossing the [[Longfellow Bridge]]]]\n[[Image:Inbound train passing construction at Brigham Circle, March 2002.jpg|thumb|right|Green Line subway/surface train on street track]]\n[[Image:MBTA Blue Line train at Airport Station in 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Blue Line subway train at the airport]]\n[[Image:Southbound Orange Line train at North Station, February 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orange Line subway train at North Station]]\nBoston has the oldest subway system in North America, with the first underground streetcar traffic dating back to 1897. Today the whole subway network is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).\n\nIn the early 1960s, the then newly formed MBTA{{Dubious|The MBTA was a direct follow-on to the MTA, a reorganization, expansion, and renaming of an existing organization.|date=January 2016}} hired [[Cambridge Seven Associates]] to help develop a new [[brand identity]].  Cambridge Seven came up with a circled T to represent such concepts as \"transit\", \"transportation\" and \"tunnel.\" Today, Bostonians call their rapid transit network \"the T\", and it is the [[List of United States rapid transit systems by ridership|fourth busiest in the country]], with daily ridership of 549,000 trips excluding the Silver Line bus.<ref>American Public Transportation Association, [http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1hr.pdf Heavy Rail Transit Ridership Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810084851/http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q1hr.pdf |date=August 10, 2007 }}, First Quarter 2007.</ref> This compares with the [[Washington Metro]]'s 910,100, the [[Chicago 'L']]'s 596,300, and Los Angeles's 126,900, but is overshadowed by [[NYCTA|New York City]]'s 6.0 million average daily weekday trips.\n\nThe one-way fare is $2.40 with a [[CharlieCard]] or $2.90 if paid with a CharlieTicket or cash. Monthly commuter passes, and day and week visitor's passes are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mbta.com/fares#bus_subway_overview |website=Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority |title=Fares Overview |accessdate=January 4, 2019}}</ref> There are four [[rapid transit|subway]] lines in the metropolitan Boston area: the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]], [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green&nbsp;Line]], [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]], and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]. The colors of each line have a symbolic meaning: the Blue Line runs under Boston Harbor; the Red Line used to terminate at [[Harvard University]] (whose school color is [[crimson]]); the Orange Line used to run along Washington Street, which was once called Orange Street; and the Green Line runs along parts of the [[Emerald Necklace]] into the leafy suburbs of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Throwback Thursday: When the T Was Color-Coded |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2016/08/25/mbta-color-history/ |website=Boston Magazine |accessdate=January 4, 2019|date=August 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe Green Line is actually four different lines; it starts as one trunk line but then splits into four different branches, the [[Green Line \"B\" Branch|B]] (Boston College), [[Green Line \"C\" Branch|C]] (Cleveland Circle), [[Green Line \"D\" Branch|D]] (Riverside) and [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|E]] (Heath Street) trains. Because the split is only relevant on the outbound direction of travel, one may take any train inbound, but when going outbound one must be careful to board the correct train. The Red Line splits as well, with southbound trains going either to Braintree or Ashmont.\n\nThough most of Boston's [[rapid transit]] network is powered via [[third rail]], the outermost portions of the Blue Line, as well as all of the Green Line and [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]], are powered via [[overhead lines]]. The name \"subway\" is something of a misnomer; as with other systems, large segments run above ground when far from the city's downtown.  Additionally, the Green and Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Lines are technically [[light-rail]] services, using [[Light rail vehicle|LRV]]s and [[streetcars]] rather than typical [[multiple unit]] heavy railcar equipment. The Ashmont-Mattapan line uses refurbished classic pre-war \"[[PCC streetcar|PCC]]\" trolleys on an exclusive right of way; the Green Line relies on modern high-capacity [[Light rail|LRV]] cars from Japan and Italy.\n\nLike the [[New York City Subway]], Boston's subway system in theory does keep to an exact fixed schedule. Starting around 2011, the MBTA introduced overhead displays at the train platform level which indicate estimated arrival times for the next two trains in each direction.  In addition, real-time information about train location (and bus location) is available via an [[Open Data]] protocol on the Internet, enabling a large number of third-party smartphone apps and web sites to display expected arrival times throughout the MBTA system.  The Green Line relies more on operators than its signal system compared to other lines, especially where trams are driven across or even in automobile lanes on surface rails.  Due to a sparsity of data collected by the existing system, real-time Green Line arrival predictions are not expected until tracking infrastructure upgrades are completed in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/allston_brighton/2013/01/mbta_mobile_apps_will_be_able.html|title=MBTA: Mobile apps will be able to track Green Line trains by 2015|work=Boston.com|date=January 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Elevated sections====\nDespite the first rapid transit segment being built underground, many later parts were built as [[elevated railway]]s.{{dubious|this implies a major separation in time; the first elevated was only 4 years later|date=January 2016}} A century later, most of these elevated railway sections have been replaced by [[Cut (earthmoving)|cut]] or tunnel routing.  The only remaining classic elevated structures are the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]'s [[Lechmere Viaduct]], including the [[Science Park (MBTA station)|Science Park]] station, and a short segment of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Charles-MGH (MBTA station)|Charles-MGH]], connecting the tunnel under [[Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Beacon Hill]] to the [[Longfellow Bridge]].\n\nThe [[Boston Elevated Railway]] was the company that owned all the elevateds and subways. The following Els once existed:\n*[[Causeway Street Elevated]] (closed 2004), from the [[Haymarket Incline]] to the [[Lechmere Viaduct]]\n*[[Washington Street Elevated]] (closed 1987), from [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills]] to an incline north of the [[Masspike]]\n*[[Charlestown Elevated]] (closed April 4, 1975), from the [[Haymarket Incline]] to [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]]\n*[[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] (closed 1938), from the Washington Street El at the [[Castle Street Wye]] at Herald Street (Tower 'D') to the Charlestown El and Causeway Street El at [[North Station]] (Tower 'C')\n\n=== Common user rail network ===\nUnlike the subway, which is owned and operated by the MBTA, the common user network is owned and operated by a mixture of various public and private sector bodies. In the Boston area, trackage is owned by a mixture of the MBTA and several freight railroads. Commuter rail services are operated by the [[Keolis]] Commuter Services (KCS)<ref>http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=6442451214&month=1&year=14 MBTA press release on Keolis Commuter Services award</ref> under contract to the MBTA, intercity passenger services are operated by [[Amtrak]], and freight services are operated by the various freight railroads.

There are approximately 125,000 one-way trips on the commuter rail each day, making it the [[List of United States commuter rail systems by ridership|fifth-busiest]] commuter rail system in the country, outranked only by the various systems serving New York and Chicago suburbs.\n\nThere are two major [[rail terminal]]s in Boston: [[North Station]] and [[South Station]]. Commuter rail lines from the North Shore and northwestern suburbs begin and terminate at North Station; lines from the South Shore and the west start and end at South Station. There is no direct rail connection between North Station and South Station, so that interchange between the two stations generally requires the use of two different subway lines (Red/Orange or Red/Green).  However, passengers on commuter lines serving [[Back Bay (MBTA station)|Back Bay Station]] can interchange directly from there to North Station using the Orange Line, and passengers on the [[Fitchburg Line]] can interchange directly from [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter]] to South Station using the Red Line.\n\n==== Intercity rail ====\n[[Image:Acela Regional in Boston South Station.jpg|thumb|''Northeast Regional'' train at South Station. The ''Acela'' name on the locomotive dates from the period when these trains were branded ''Acela Regional''.]]\nBoston is served by four intercity rail services, all operated by [[Amtrak]]. The ''[[Acela Express]]'' and ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' services both operate on the [[Northeast Corridor]] to and from [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] A branch of the ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' service operates to and from [[Chicago]].

The ''Downeaster'' service terminates at North Station, primarily because the ''Downeaster'' Amtrak line is intended for points north of downtown. The Northeast Corridor and ''Lake Shore Limited'' services also stop at [[Back Bay station]]. The lack of a direct rail connection between North Station and South Station means that passengers transferring to and from the ''Downeaster'' are faced with a transfer between stations. Although most such transfers can be achieved using the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] between Back Bay and North Station, Amtrak recommends passengers with luggage to use a taxi.<ref name=\"amra\"/><ref name=amrade>{{cite web | title = Routes - Northeast - Downeaster | url = http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Vertical_Route_Page&c=am2Route&cid=1081256321869&ssid=134 | publisher = Amtrak | accessdate = June 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWithin the Boston area, most Amtrak services operate over commuter rail track owned by the MBTA, who also own the Northeast Corridor track as far as the [[Rhode Island]] state line.<ref name=\"sppnemc\"/>\n\n==== Freight rail ====\n[[CSX Transportation|CSX]] is the only [[class I railroad]] serving the Boston area, which it reaches by its [[Boston Subdivision]] line to [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], and by [[trackage rights]] over the Northeast Corridor. CSX also has trackage rights over much of the southern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In February 2013, CSX moved freight operations from its Beacon Park Yard in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]<ref name=\"sppnemc\"/> to a newly refurbished [[Double-stack rail transport|double stack intermodal yard]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and a new [[transload]] facility in [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westborough]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/orgs/office-of-the-governor|title=Office of Governor Charlie Baker and Lt. Governor Karyn Polito|website=Mass.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe other significant freight railroad in the Boston area is [[Pan Am Railways]] (PAR; formerly known as the Guilford Rail System). PAR is a [[class II railroad]] that operates lines to the north and west of Boston, reaching destinations in [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] as well as Massachusetts. It also has trackage rights over much of the northern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In May 2008, PAR announced a venture with [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] to create a jointly owned freight corridor, branded the [[Patriot Corridor]], linking Boston to a newly refurbished intermodal yard in [[Mechanicville, New York]], just north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]].<ref name=\"sppnemc\"/><ref name=parnspc>{{cite web | publisher = Norfolk Southern Corp. | url = http://www.nscorp.com/nscportal/nscorp/Media/News%20Releases/2008/news051508_2.html | title = Pan Am Railways and Norfolk Southern Create the Patriot Corridor to Improve Rail Service and Expand Capacity in New York and New England | date = May 15, 2008 | accessdate = June 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOnly a few rail freight customers remain in or near Boston, including a chemical packager in Allston, and food distribution facilities and a scrap metal processor in [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]].

One of these is an inner harbor service, linking the downtown waterfront with [[Boston Navy Yard]] in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]]. The other routes are commuter routes, linking downtown to [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]. Some commuter services connect via [[Logan International Airport]]. All services are operated by [[private sector]] companies under contract to the MBTA.\n\nOutside the MBTA system, seasonal passenger ferry services operate to the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area|Boston Harbor Islands]], to the city of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], and to the city of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] on [[Cape Cod]]. [[Water taxi]]s provide on-demand service from various points on the downtown waterfront and from [[Logan International Airport|Logan Airport]], and in particular between the airport and downtown.\n\nSeveral companies operate tourist oriented cruise boats on the harbor and on the [[Charles River]]. Other companies operate [[duck tour]]s that use amphibious vehicles (mostly derived from World War II era [[DUKW]]s), and encompass both the city's streets and its waterways. On a much smaller scale, but perhaps more [[cultural icon|iconic]] of Boston, are the human-powered [[Swan Boats (Boston, Massachusetts)|Swan Boats]] on the lake of the city's [[Public Garden (Boston, Massachusetts)|Public Garden]].\n\n==Public transportation statistics==\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Boston, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 83 min. 29% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 15 minutes, while 24% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced
