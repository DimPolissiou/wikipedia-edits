All have evolved powerful digging forearms, long tongues, and toothless, tube-like snouts to subsist by raiding termite mounds.

The [[Constitution of Vermont]] is the supreme law of the state, followed by the [[Vermont Statutes]]. This is roughly analogous to the Federal [[United States Constitution]], [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]] respectively. Provision is made for the following frame of government under the Constitution of the State of Vermont: the [[executive branch]], the [[legislative branch]], and the [[judicial branch]]. All members of the executive and legislative branch serve two-year terms including the governor and senators. There are no [[term limit]]s for any office.\n\nThe Vermont state capital is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]]. In 1791, Vermont [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|joined the United States as the fourteenth state]].\n\nAn in-depth evaluation of government in 2008 ranked Vermont high compared to other states. It ranked highest in \"small discrete issues and huge global ones.\" It performed poorly in the issues in-between and planning for the future.<ref>[http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Grading-the-States-2008.pdf Pew Report 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028183611/http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Grading-the-States-2008.pdf |date=2008-10-28 }} accessed March 26, 2008</ref>\n\n== Civil rights and liberties ==\n\nThe [[Vermont Constitution]] guarantees broad rights for its citizens. Adopted in 1793, it contains in its first article (\"Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont\") a far-reaching [[bill of rights]], one of the most extensive in the world at the time of its adoption. Predating the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] by 14 years, the 1777 Constitution prohibited slavery and [[indentured servitude]] and provided for [[universal male suffrage]], with no property ownership requirement for voting rights. It also set forth broad protections of religious freedom and conscience while erecting a strong [[separation between church and state]] by prohibiting establishment or promotion of any faith by the government or compulsion to worship. The \"Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of The State of Vermont\" is believed to have been a model for France's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] later.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nVermont's [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] is the [[Vermont General Assembly]], a [[bicameral legislature|bicameral body]] composed of the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] (the [[lower house]]) and the [[Vermont Senate]] (the [[upper house]]) meet at the [[Vermont State House]]. The Senate is composed of 30 state senators, while the House of Representatives has 150 members.\n\nState legislators are paid $536 per week while the legislature is in session plus $87 per diem.<ref>[http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=14244 Legislative Pay] accessed February 9, 2008</ref>\n\nWith the current estimated population of Vermont from the last [[U.S. Census]], there is approximately one Representative for every 4,059 residents.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/reports/02Redistricting/Redistricting_Standards.pdf Vermont Legislature Redistricting] accessed February 9, 2008</ref>\n\n==Executive branch==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Elected Executive Officers of Vermont\">\nFile:Phil Scott.jpg|[[Governor of Vermont|Governor]] [[Phil Scott (politician)|Phil Scott]] (R)\nFile:DavidZuckermanHeadshot.jpg|[[Lieutenant governor of Vermont|Lieutenant Governor]] [[David Zuckerman (politician)|David Zuckerman]] (P)\nFile:James C.

The [[Constitution of Vermont]] is the supreme law of the state, followed by the [[Vermont Statutes]]. This is roughly analogous to the Federal [[United States Constitution]], [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]] respectively. Provision is made for the following frame of government under the Constitution of the State of Vermont: the [[executive branch]], the [[legislative branch]], and the [[judicial branch]]. All members of the executive and legislative branch serve two-year terms including the governor and senators. There are no [[term limit]]s for any office.\n\nThe Vermont state capital is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]]. In 1791, Vermont [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|joined the United States as the fourteenth state]].\n\nAn in-depth evaluation of government in 2008 ranked Vermont high compared to other states. It ranked highest in \"small discrete issues and huge global ones.\" It performed poorly in the issues in-between and planning for the future.<ref>[http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Grading-the-States-2008.pdf Pew Report 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028183611/http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Grading-the-States-2008.pdf |date=2008-10-28 }} accessed March 26, 2008</ref>\n\n== Civil rights and liberties ==\n\nThe [[Vermont Constitution]] guarantees broad rights for its citizens. Adopted in 1793, it contains in its first article (\"Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the State of Vermont\") a far-reaching [[bill of rights]], one of the most extensive in the world at the time of its adoption. Predating the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights]] by 14 years, the 1777 Constitution prohibited slavery and [[indentured servitude]] and provided for [[universal male suffrage]], with no property ownership requirement for voting rights. It also set forth broad protections of religious freedom and conscience while erecting a strong [[separation between church and state]] by prohibiting establishment or promotion of any faith by the government or compulsion to worship. The \"Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of The State of Vermont\" is believed to have been a model for France's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] later.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nVermont's [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] is the [[Vermont General Assembly]], a [[bicameral legislature|bicameral body]] composed of the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] (the [[lower house]]) and the [[Vermont Senate]] (the [[upper house]]) meet at the [[Vermont State House]]. The Senate is composed of 30 state senators, while the House of Representatives has 150 members.\n\nState legislators are paid $536 per week while the legislature is in session plus $87 per diem.<ref>[http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=14244 Legislative Pay] accessed February 9, 2008</ref>\n\nWith the current estimated population of Vermont from the last [[U.S. Census]], there is approximately one Representative for every 4,059 residents.<ref>[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/reports/02Redistricting/Redistricting_Standards.pdf Vermont Legislature Redistricting] accessed February 9, 2008</ref>\n\n==Executive branch==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Elected Executive Officers of Vermont\">\nFile:Phil Scott.jpg|[[Governor of Vermont|Governor]] [[Phil Scott (politician)|Phil Scott]] (R)\nFile:DavidZuckermanHeadshot.jpg|[[Lieutenant governor of Vermont|Lieutenant Governor]] [[David Zuckerman (politician)|David Zuckerman]] (P)\nFile:James C.

For example, when Republican Governor [[Richard Snelling]] died in office in 1991, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor [[Howard Dean]] succeeded him for the remainder of that term. In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, Vermonters elect four other officials on a statewide ballot: [[Secretary of State of Vermont|Secretary of State]], State Treasurer, [[Vermont Auditor of Accounts]], and [[Vermont Attorney General|Attorney General]].\n\nThe executive branch had about 8,000 employees in 2005, making it the largest employer in the state.<ref>[http://www.vermontpersonnel.org/htm/pdf/WorkForceReportFY05.pdf Vermont Personnel report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122916/http://www.vermontpersonnel.org/htm/pdf/WorkForceReportFY05.pdf |date=2008-05-09 }} accessed February 3, 2008</ref> This high number is due, in part, to Vermont (and New England's) practice of assuming the functions, and therefore the budgets of the county government which is nearly non-existent.

The oesophagus is a [[:wiktionary:fibromuscular|fibromuscular]] tube, about 25&nbsp;centimeters long in adults, which travels behind the [[trachea]] and [[human heart|heart]], passes through the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and empties into the uppermost region of the [[stomach]]. During swallowing, the [[epiglottis]] tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the [[larynx]] and lungs. The word ''oesophagus'' is the [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English#O|Greek word]] \u03bf\u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 {{lang|grc-Latn|oisophagos}}, meaning \"gullet\".\n\nThe wall of the oesophagus from the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] outwards consists of [[mucosa]], [[submucosa]] (connective tissue), [[muscular layer|layers of muscle fibers]] between layers of [[fibrous tissue]], and an outer layer of connective tissue. The mucosa is a [[stratified squamous epithelium]] of around three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the [[simple columnar epithelia|single layer of columnar cells]] of the stomach. The transition between these two types of epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. Most of the muscle is [[smooth muscle]] although [[striated muscle]] predominates in its upper third. It has two muscular rings or [[sphincter]]s in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The oesophagus has a rich blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves ([[sympathetic nerve]]s via the [[sympathetic trunk]] and [[parasympathetic nerve]]s via the [[vagus nerve]]) and in addition voluntary nerves ([[lower motor neurons]]) which are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.\n\nThe oesophagus may be affected by [[GERD|gastric reflux]], [[oesophageal cancer|cancer]], prominent dilated blood vessels called [[oesophageal varices|varices]] that can bleed heavily, [[Mallory-Weiss Syndrome|tears]], constrictions, and disorders of motility. Diseases may cause difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), painful swallowing ([[odynophagia]]), [[chest pain]], or cause no symptoms at all. Clinical investigations include [[upper gastrointestinal series|X-rays]] when swallowing [[barium sulphate|barium]], [[endoscopy]], and [[CT scan]]s.

These are separated by the [[myenteric plexus]], a tangled network of nerve fibres involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the oesophagus. The outermost layer of the oesophagus is the [[adventitia]] in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in [[serosa]]. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.<ref name=KUO2006 />\n\n==Development==\nIn early [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], the oesophagus develops from the [[endoderm]]al [[gastrointestinal tract|primitive gut tube]].

At the same time, the upper oesophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of food to enter. [[Peristalsis|Peristaltic]] contractions of the oesophageal muscle push the food down the oesophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the oesophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 />\n\n===Reducing gastric reflux===\nThe stomach produces [[gastric acid]], a strongly [[acid]]ic mixture consisting of [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[potassium chloride|potassium]] and [[sodium chloride|sodium]] salts to enable food [[digestion]]. Constriction of the upper and lower oesophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the oesophageal mucosa.

For a more complete list, see [[oesophageal disease]].\n\n===Inflammation===\n{{Main|Oesophagitis}}\nInflammation of the oesophagus is known as [[oesophagitis]]. [[GERD|Reflux]] of [[gastric acid]]s from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, [[corrosive substance|corrosives]]), some [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] (such as [[bisphosphonate]]s), and [[food allergies]] can all lead to oesophagitis. [[Esophageal candidiasis]] is an infection of the yeast ''[[Candida albicans]]'' that may occur when a person is [[immunocompromised]]. {{As of|2014}} the cause of some forms of oesophagitis, such as [[eosinophilic esophagitis]], is not known. Oesophagitis can cause [[Odynophagia|painful swallowing]] and is usually treated by managing the cause of the oesophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010/>\n\n=== Barrett's oesophagus ===\n{{Main|Barrett's oesophagus}}\nProlonged oesophagitis, particularly from gastric reflux, is one factor thought to play a role in the development of [[Barrett's esophagus]]. In this condition, there is [[metaplasia]] of the lining of the lower oesophagus, which changes from [[stratified squamous epithelia]] to [[simple columnar epithelia]]. Barrett's oesophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of [[oesophageal cancer]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONS2010\" />\n\n===Cancer===\n{{Main|Oesophageal cancer}}\nThere are two main types of [[Oesophageal cancer|cancer of the esophagus]]. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] is a [[carcinoma]] that can occur in the squamous cells lining the oesophagus. This type is much more common in [[China]] and [[Iran]]. The other main type is an [[adenocarcinoma]] that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the oesophagus. This is most common in [[developed countries]] in those with Barrett's oesophagus, and occurs in the cuboidal cells.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\nIn its early stages, oesophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all. When severe, oesophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the oesophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is [[TNM staging|staged using a system]] that measures how far into the oesophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many [[lymph node]]s are affected, and whether there are any [[metastases]] in different parts of the body. Oesophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by [[oesophagectomy|partial surgical removal of the oesophagus]]. Inserting a [[esophageal stent|stent]] into the oesophagus, or inserting a [[nasogastric tube]], may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. {{As of|2014}}, the prognosis for oesophageal cancer is still poor, so [[palliative therapy]] may also be a focus of treatment.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010/>\n\n===Varices===\n{{Main|Oesophageal varices}}\n[[Esophageal varices]] are swollen twisted branches of the [[azygous vein]] in the lower third of the oesophagus. These blood vessels [[anastomose]] (join up) with those of the [[portal vein]] when [[portal hypertension]] develops.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Daniel|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=2025|edition=32nd}}</ref> These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the oesophagus. These blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the [[abdomen]] as a result of [[portal hypertension]], usually as a result of [[liver disease]]s such as [[cirrhosis]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010/>{{rp|941\u201342}} This collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the oesophagus drains into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices.<ref name=KUO2006/><ref name=PATTI1997/>\n\nOesophageal varices often do not have symptoms until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency, because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding varix may cause a person [[haematemesis|to vomit blood]], or suffer [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. To deal with a ruptured varix, a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or a small amount of a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. [[IV fluids]] and [[blood product]]s may be given in order to prevent [[hypovolemia]] from excess blood loss.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\n===Motility disorders===\nSeveral disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the oesophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called [[dysphagia]], or painful swallowing, called [[odynophagia]]. [[Achalasia]] refers to a failure of the lower oesophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the oesophagus, and possibly eventual [[megaesophagus]]. A [[nutcracker oesophagus]] refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. [[Diffuse oesophageal spasm]] is a spasm of the oesophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such [[referred pain]] to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in oesophageal conditions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=Dale|title=Neuroscience|date=2011|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87893-695-3|page=214|edition=5.}}</ref> Sclerosis of the oesophagus, such as with [[systemic sclerosis]] or in [[CREST syndrome]] may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\n===Malformations===\n[[Oesophageal stricture]]s are usually benign and typically develop after a person has had [[GERD|reflux]] for many years. Other strictures may include [[esophageal web]]s (which can also be congenital) and damage to the oesophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or oeosinophilic esophagitis. A [[Schatzki ring]] is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic [[anemia]], and [[Plummer-Vinson]] syndrome.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\nTwo of the most common [[congenital disorder|congenital]] malformations affecting the esophagus are an [[esophageal atresia]] where the oesophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an [[tracheoesophageal fistula|esophageal fistula]] \u2013 an abnormal connection between the oesophagus and the trachea.<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=William J.|title=Human embryology|date=2001|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-443-06583-5|pages=148\u2013149|edition=3.}}</ref> Both of these conditions usually occur together.<ref name=\"Larsen\"/> These are found in about 1 in 3500 births.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shaw-Smith|first=C|title=esophageal atresia, tracheo-esophageal fistula, and the VACTERL association: review of genetics and epidemiology|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|date=18 November 2005|volume=43|issue=7|pages=545\u201354|doi=10.1136/jmg.2005.038158|pmid=16299066|pmc=2564549}}</ref> Half of these cases may be part of a [[syndrome]] where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the [[heart]] or [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s.

The oesophagus may also be [[medical imaging|imaged]] using a flexible camera inserted into the oesophagus, in a procedure called an [[endoscopy]]. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the oesophagus. During an endoscopy, a [[biopsy]] may be taken.

The esophagus is a [[:wiktionary:fibromuscular|fibromuscular]] tube, about 25&nbsp;centimeters long in adults, which travels behind the [[trachea]] and [[human heart|heart]], passes through the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and empties into the uppermost region of the [[stomach]]. During swallowing, the [[epiglottis]] tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the [[larynx]] and lungs. The word ''oesophagus'' is the [[List of Greek and Latin roots in English#O|Greek word]] \u03bf\u1f30\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 {{lang|grc-Latn|oisophagos}}, meaning \"gullet\".\n\nThe wall of the esophagus from the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] outwards consists of [[mucosa]], [[submucosa]] (connective tissue), [[muscular layer|layers of muscle fibers]] between layers of [[fibrous tissue]], and an outer layer of connective tissue. The mucosa is a [[stratified squamous epithelium]] of around three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the [[simple columnar epithelia|single layer of columnar cells]] of the stomach. The transition between these two types of epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. Most of the muscle is [[smooth muscle]] although [[striated muscle]] predominates in its upper third. It has two muscular rings or [[sphincter]]s in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The esophagus has a rich blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves ([[sympathetic nerve]]s via the [[sympathetic trunk]] and [[parasympathetic nerve]]s via the [[vagus nerve]]) and in addition voluntary nerves ([[lower motor neurons]]) which are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.\n\nThe esophagus may be affected by [[GERD|gastric reflux]], [[oesophageal cancer|cancer]], prominent dilated blood vessels called [[oesophageal varices|varices]] that can bleed heavily, [[Mallory-Weiss Syndrome|tears]], constrictions, and disorders of motility. Diseases may cause difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), painful swallowing ([[odynophagia]]), [[chest pain]], or cause no symptoms at all.

For a more complete list, see [[esophageal disease]].\n\n===Inflammation===\n{{Main|Esophagitis}}\nInflammation of the esophagus is known as [[esophagitis]]. [[GERD|Reflux]] of [[gastric acid]]s from the stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, [[corrosive substance|corrosives]]), some [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] (such as [[bisphosphonate]]s), and [[food allergies]] can all lead to esophagitis. [[Esophageal candidiasis]] is an infection of the yeast ''[[Candida albicans]]'' that may occur when a person is [[immunocompromised]]. {{As of|2014}} the cause of some forms of esophagitis, such as [[eosinophilic esophagitis]], is not known. Esophagitis can cause [[Odynophagia|painful swallowing]] and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010/>\n\n=== Barrett's esophagus ===\n{{Main|Barrett's esophagus}}\nProlonged esophagitis, particularly from gastric reflux, is one factor thought to play a role in the development of [[Barrett's esophagus]]. In this condition, there is [[metaplasia]] of the lining of the lower esophagus, which changes from [[stratified squamous epithelia]] to [[simple columnar epithelia]]. Barrett's esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of [[esophageal cancer]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONS2010\" />\n\n===Cancer===\n{{Main|Esophageal cancer}}\nThere are two main types of [[Esophageal cancer|cancer of the esophagus]]. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] is a [[carcinoma]] that can occur in the squamous cells lining the esophagus. This type is much more common in [[China]] and [[Iran]]. The other main type is an [[adenocarcinoma]] that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus. This is most common in [[developed countries]] in those with Barrett's esophagus, and occurs in the cuboidal cells.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\nIn its early stages, esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is [[TNM staging|staged using a system]] that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many [[lymph node]]s are affected, and whether there are any [[metastases]] in different parts of the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by [[esophagectomy|partial surgical removal of the esophagus]]. Inserting a [[esophageal stent|stent]] into the esophagus, or inserting a [[nasogastric tube]], may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. {{As of|2014}}, the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so [[palliative therapy]] may also be a focus of treatment.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010/>\n\n===Varices===\n{{Main|Esophageal varices}}\n[[Esophageal varices]] are swollen twisted branches of the [[azygous vein]] in the lower third of the esophagus. These blood vessels [[anastomose]] (join up) with those of the [[portal vein]] when [[portal hypertension]] develops.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Daniel|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=2025|edition=32nd}}</ref> These blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus. These blood vessels develop as part of a collateral circulation that occurs to drain blood from the [[abdomen]] as a result of [[portal hypertension]], usually as a result of [[liver disease]]s such as [[cirrhosis]].<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010/>{{rp|941\u201342}} This collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the esophagus drains into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Because of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins, if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus. Veins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices.<ref name=KUO2006/><ref name=PATTI1997/>\n\nEsophageal varices often do not have symptoms until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency, because varices can bleed a lot. A bleeding varix may cause a person [[haematemesis|to vomit blood]], or suffer [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. To deal with a ruptured varix, a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or a small amount of a clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. A surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. [[IV fluids]] and [[blood product]]s may be given in order to prevent [[hypovolemia]] from excess blood loss.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\n===Motility disorders===\nSeveral disorders affect the motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called [[dysphagia]], or painful swallowing, called [[odynophagia]]. [[Achalasia]] refers to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual [[megaesophagus]]. A [[nutcracker esophagus]] refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. [[Diffuse esophageal spasm]] is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such [[referred pain]] to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=Dale|title=Neuroscience|date=2011|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87893-695-3|page=214|edition=5.}}</ref> Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with [[systemic sclerosis]] or in [[CREST syndrome]] may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\n===Malformations===\n[[Esophageal stricture]]s are usually benign and typically develop after a person has had [[GERD|reflux]] for many years. Other strictures may include [[esophageal web]]s (which can also be congenital) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. A [[Schatzki ring]] is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. Strictures may also develop in chronic [[anemia]], and [[Plummer-Vinson]] syndrome.<ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 />\n\nTwo of the most common [[congenital disorder|congenital]] malformations affecting the esophagus are an [[esophageal atresia]] where the esophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an [[tracheoesophageal fistula|esophageal fistula]] \u2013 an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea.<ref name=\"Larsen\">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=William J.|title=Human embryology|date=2001|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-443-06583-5|pages=148\u2013149|edition=3.}}</ref> Both of these conditions usually occur together.<ref name=\"Larsen\"/> These are found in about 1 in 3500 births.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shaw-Smith|first=C|title=esophageal atresia, tracheo-esophageal fistula, and the VACTERL association: review of genetics and epidemiology|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|date=18 November 2005|volume=43|issue=7|pages=545\u201354|doi=10.1136/jmg.2005.038158|pmid=16299066|pmc=2564549}}</ref> Half of these cases may be part of a [[syndrome]] where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the [[heart]] or [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s.

The esophagus may also be [[medical imaging|imaged]] using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an [[endoscopy]]. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a [[biopsy]] may be taken.

Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal [[composers]], with almost all of the band's songs credited to them. During the years, the band has only changed drummers.\n\n==History==\n===Early years and Peaceville (1988\u20131991)===\nAfter their formation in 1988, Paradise Lost released three cassette demos, ''Paradise Lost'', ''Frozen Illusion'', and ''Plains of Desolation'', before being signed to [[Peaceville Records]] in 1989. They recorded their debut album, [[Lost Paradise (album)|''Lost Paradise'']], at [[Academy Music Studio]] in December of that year. The album was released in February 1990.<ref name=allmusicBio>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13905|pure_url=yes}} Paradise Lost Biography, at allmusic.com]</ref>\n\nIn November 1990, Paradise Lost returned to Academy Music Studio to record their second album, ''[[Gothic (Paradise Lost album)|Gothic]]'', which was released in March 1991. The band began to move away from the death/doom sound of their previous releases by adding keyboards and female vocal accompaniments.<ref name=AllmusicGothic>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost - Gothic review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gothic-mw0000096112|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music for Nations (1992\u20131998)===\n[[File:Paradiselost91.JPG|thumb|left|Paradise Lost performing live, 1991.]]\nParadise Lost left Peaceville and were signed to the [[Music for Nations]] label and released ''[[Shades of God]]'' in July 1992.<ref name=allmusicBio /> The band's musical approach continued to evolve with this album as evidenced by the addition of quieter passages in the song's compositions, the softening of vocalist [[Nick Holmes (singer)|Nick Holmes]]'s [[death grunt]], and Gregor Mackintosh's incorporation of [[acoustic guitar]] to his sound.<ref name=allmusicShades>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost - Shades of God review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shades-of-god-mw0000107277|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> The album contained the song \"As I Die\", later released as a [[As I Die|single/EP]].\n\nIn summer 1993, the band recorded their fourth album, ''[[Icon (Paradise Lost album)|Icon]],'' released in September of the same year. The band continued to develop their sound away from their doom roots and more towards the dynamics and sound of \"As I Die\" from their previous album. On ''Icon'', Nick Holmes abandoned his [[death grunt]] and started using a \"[[James Hetfield]]-style bark.\"<ref name=allmusicIcon>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Christopher|title=Paradise Lost - Icon review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/icon-mw0000107875|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> It was after this album, in December 1994, that original member Matthew Archer quit and was replaced by drummer [[Lee Morris (musician)|Lee Morris]].\n\nThe band entered the studio in January 1995 to record their fifth and most successful album, ''[[Draconian Times]]'', which was released in June 1995.

Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal [[composers]], with almost all of the band's songs credited to them. During the years, the band has only changed drummers.\n\n==History==\n===Early years and Peaceville (1988\u20131991)===\nAfter their formation in 1988, Paradise Lost released three cassette demos, ''Paradise Lost'', ''Frozen Illusion'', and ''Plains of Desolation'', before being signed to [[Peaceville Records]] in 1989. They recorded their debut album, [[Lost Paradise (album)|''Lost Paradise'']], at [[Academy Music Studio]] in December of that year. The album was released in February 1990.<ref name=allmusicBio>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13905|pure_url=yes}} Paradise Lost Biography, at allmusic.com]</ref>\n\nIn November 1990, Paradise Lost returned to Academy Music Studio to record their second album, ''[[Gothic (Paradise Lost album)|Gothic]]'', which was released in March 1991. The band began to move away from the death/doom sound of their previous releases by adding keyboards and female vocal accompaniments.<ref name=AllmusicGothic>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost - Gothic review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gothic-mw0000096112|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music for Nations (1992\u20131998)===\n[[File:Paradiselost91.JPG|thumb|left|Paradise Lost performing live, 1991.]]\nParadise Lost left Peaceville and were signed to the [[Music for Nations]] label and released ''[[Shades of God]]'' in July 1992.<ref name=allmusicBio /> The band's musical approach continued to evolve with this album as evidenced by the addition of quieter passages in the song's compositions, the softening of vocalist [[Nick Holmes (singer)|Nick Holmes]]'s [[death grunt]], and Gregor Mackintosh's incorporation of [[acoustic guitar]] to his sound.<ref name=allmusicShades>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost - Shades of God review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shades-of-god-mw0000107277|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> The album contained the song \"As I Die\", later released as a [[As I Die|single/EP]].\n\nIn summer 1993, the band recorded their fourth album, ''[[Icon (Paradise Lost album)|Icon]],'' released in September of the same year. The band continued to develop their sound away from their doom roots and more towards the dynamics and sound of \"As I Die\" from their previous album. On ''Icon'', Nick Holmes abandoned his [[death grunt]] and started using a \"[[James Hetfield]]-style bark.\"<ref name=allmusicIcon>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Christopher|title=Paradise Lost - Icon review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/icon-mw0000107875|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> It was after this album, in December 1994, that original member Matthew Archer quit and was replaced by drummer [[Lee Morris (musician)|Lee Morris]].\n\nThe band entered the studio in January 1995 to record their fifth and most successful album, ''[[Draconian Times]]'', which was released in June 1995. Mackintosh says about ''Draconian Times'', \"that it's the album by which everything else we do gets judged.

Persons with more fat will have a higher proportion of carbon and a lower proportion of most other elements (the proportion of hydrogen will be about the same).\nThe numbers in the table are averages of different numbers reported by different references.\n\nThe adult human body averages ~53% water.<ref>Use [[WP:CALC]] for the mean of means for males and females, since the two groups are of about equal size</ref> This varies substantially by age, sex, and adiposity. In a large sample of adults of all ages and both sexes, the figure for water fraction by weight was found to be 48 \u00b16% for females and 58 \u00b18% water for males.<ref name=\"here\">See table 1.
