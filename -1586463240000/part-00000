As the tornado crossed into [[Dickinson County, Kansas|Dickinson County]] and moved through rural areas northeast of Solomon, significant weakening occurred as EF1 tree and house damage was noted along this segment of the path. Re-intensification began to occur to the south of [[Talmage, Kansas|Talmage]] where a two-story house had much of its second floor destroyed, sustaining EF2 damage. A nearby home sustained EF1 damage to its roof as well.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/</ref> The tornado strengthened further as it passed to the north of [[Abeline, Kansas|Abeline]], causing significant damage. A house near the corner of Gulf Road and 2700 Avenue sustained EF3 damage and was left with only interior rooms standing, while another home and a large metal outbuilding sustained EF2 damage. High-end EF3 damage was noted along Hawk Road, where a large but poorly anchored home was completely flattened. The most intense damage in this area occurred at the intersection of Indy Road and 2700 Avenue, where a split-level home was completely swept away, leaving only the basement behind. Anchor bolts were present at this location, though the home's subflooring was poorly anchored, and an EF4 rating was applied. Outbuildings were also destroyed in the vicinity, and a two-story farm home sustained lesser damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cjonline.com/news/2016-05-26/dickinson-county-tornado-wednesday-upgraded-ef4-were-damn-lucky-be-alive |title=Dickinson County tornado from Wednesday classified as EF4: 'We're damn lucky to be alive' |last1=Ranker |first1=Luke |date=May 26, 2016 |website=cjonline.com |publisher=The Topeka-Capitol Journal |access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref> Further to the east, the tornado narrowed and weakened back to EF1 strength as it passed through areas to the northeast of Abeline, causing mainly minor tree damage. However, it strengthened back to EF2 intensity as it crossed [[Interstate 70]], snapping and denuding numerous large trees. The tornado then reached its peak strength as it passed just southwest of [[Chapman, Kansas|Chapman]], producing high-end EF4 damage as it crossed Old Highway 40. A few farmsteads in this area were damaged or destroyed, including one where a large, anchor-bolted brick farm home was completely leveled and largely swept away. Only the basement and a pile of debris was left behind at this location. Part of the concrete foundation was severely cracked from the force of the house being ripped away, and surveyors later determined that winds in this area likely approached 200 MPH, though the fact that the site was not completely swept clean of debris prevented a higher rating.<ref>https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=626912</ref> Several vehicles and large pieces of heavy farm machinery in the vicinity were thrown and mangled beyond recognition. Numerous large trees were also denuded and debarked in this area, outbuildings were obliterated, and a set of railroad tracks was bent horizontally by the force of the tornado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/top/LongTrackTornadoHitsNorthCentralKS |title=Wednesday, May 25th, 2016: Long Track Tornado Hits North Central Kansas |date=June 3, 2016 |website=NWS Topeka |publisher=NWS Topeka }}</ref> While officially rated high-end EF4, NWS Topeka damage surveyors noted that based on the damage that occurred in rural areas, an [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes|EF5]] rating may have been necessary had the tornado hit Chapman directly.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Omitt, Chad |date=February 19, 2017 |title=Tornado Talk Podcast Episode 29 - Top 10 of 2016 Part 2 (Enhanced Version) |medium=Podcast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvOTNoraTEI |accessdate=November 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/</ref> The tornado began to weaken as it passed south of Chapman, causing extensive tree damage and inflicting low-end EF3 damage to a large farm house.

As the tornado crossed into [[Dickinson County, Kansas|Dickinson County]] and moved through rural areas northeast of Solomon, significant weakening occurred as EF1 tree and house damage was noted along this segment of the path. Re-intensification began to occur to the south of [[Talmage, Kansas|Talmage]] where a two-story house had much of its second floor destroyed, sustaining EF2 damage. A nearby home sustained EF1 damage to its roof as well.<ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/</ref> The tornado strengthened further as it passed to the north of [[Abeline, Kansas|Abeline]], causing significant damage. A house near the corner of Gulf Road and 2700 Avenue sustained EF3 damage and was left with only interior rooms standing, while another home and a large metal outbuilding sustained EF2 damage. High-end EF3 damage was noted along Hawk Road, where a large but poorly anchored home was completely flattened. The most intense damage in this area occurred at the intersection of Indy Road and 2700 Avenue, where a split-level home was completely swept away, leaving only the basement behind. Anchor bolts were present at this location, though the home's subflooring was poorly anchored, and an EF4 rating was applied. Outbuildings were also destroyed in the vicinity, and a two-story farm home sustained lesser damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cjonline.com/news/2016-05-26/dickinson-county-tornado-wednesday-upgraded-ef4-were-damn-lucky-be-alive |title=Dickinson County tornado from Wednesday classified as EF4: 'We're damn lucky to be alive' |last1=Ranker |first1=Luke |date=May 26, 2016 |website=cjonline.com |publisher=The Topeka-Capitol Journal |access-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref> Further to the east, the tornado narrowed and weakened back to EF1 strength as it passed through areas to the northeast of Abeline, causing mainly minor tree damage. However, it strengthened back to EF2 intensity as it crossed [[Interstate 70]], snapping and denuding numerous large trees. The tornado then reached its peak strength as it passed just southwest of [[Chapman, Kansas|Chapman]], producing high-end EF4 damage as it crossed Old Highway 40. A few farmsteads in this area were damaged or destroyed, including one where a large, anchor-bolted brick farm home was completely leveled and largely swept away. Only the basement and a pile of debris was left behind at this location. Part of the concrete foundation was severely cracked from the force of the house being ripped away, and surveyors later determined that winds in this area likely approached 200 MPH, though the fact that the site was not completely swept clean of debris prevented a higher rating.<ref>https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=626912</ref> Several vehicles and large pieces of heavy farm machinery in the vicinity were thrown and mangled beyond recognition. Numerous large trees were also denuded and debarked in this area, outbuildings were obliterated, and a set of railroad tracks was bent horizontally by the force of the tornado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/top/LongTrackTornadoHitsNorthCentralKS |title=Wednesday, May 25th, 2016: Long Track Tornado Hits North Central Kansas |date=June 3, 2016 |website=NWS Topeka |publisher=NWS Topeka }}</ref> While officially rated high-end EF4, NWS Topeka damage surveyors noted that based on the damage that occurred in rural areas, an [[List of F5 and EF5 tornadoes|EF5]] rating may have been necessary had the tornado hit Chapman directly.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Omitt, Chad |date=February 19, 2017 |title=Tornado Talk Podcast Episode 29 - Top 10 of 2016 Part 2 (Enhanced Version) |medium=Podcast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvOTNoraTEI |accessdate=November 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/StormDamage/DamageViewer/</ref> The tornado began to weaken as it passed south of Chapman, causing extensive tree damage and inflicting low-end EF3 damage to a large farm house.

When her son, [[Winston Frederick Churchill Guest|Winston Guest]], the polo player and husband of garden columnist [[C. Z. Guest]], took the apartment over, the lower floor was subdivided into three separate apartments, one of which was occupied by designer [[Bill Blass]]. The Guests lived on one side of the penthouse and one of their sons, Alexander, lived on the other side for several years. The Guests sold the apartment in 1963 about the time that their daughter, socialite [[Cornelia Guest]], was born. The apartment was then acquired by [[Janet Annenberg Hooker]], the philanthropist who died in late 1997 and was a sister of [[Walter Annenberg]], the communications magnate and art collector. The apartment was put on the market in early 1998.\n\n===Property dispute===\nThe property behind One Sutton Place South was the subject of a dispute between the building's owners and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Like the adjacent park, the rear garden at One Sutton Place South is, in fact, cantilevered over the [[FDR Drive]], a busy expressway at Manhattan's eastern edge that is not visible from most of Sutton Place. In 1939, city authorities took ownership of the property behind One Sutton Place South by condemnation in connection with the construction of the FDR Drive, then leased it back to the building.
