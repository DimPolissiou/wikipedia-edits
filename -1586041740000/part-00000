In their language, one\u00a0Balondo person is\u00a0a '''''Morondo'''''. They separate themselves from other ethnic groups by giving them specific names. ''Bafah Balondo'' refers to non-Balondo people of the Oroko region, while all others are classified as ''Bato'' (people).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nanji|first=Cyprian|url=https://www.academia.edu/41879923/Balondo_History_and_Customs|title=Balondo History and Customs|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBalondo are often also misunderstood as ''[[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu]], [[Oroko people|Oroko]], Balondoba-Nanga,'' and ''Balondoba-Diko''. ''[[Wilhelm Bleek]]'', a German linguist, used the term ''B\u00e2-ntu'' or Bantu, meaning people or humans, to classify and group people with linguistic and cultural similarities in his 1862 publication of A Comparative Grammar of South African Languages. The Balondo are a separate people based on the distinction of their language and ethnic origin compared to other groups included in Bleek's classification of Bantu people. The Balondo are a coastal people, unlike the Oroko who are a hill tribe, whose history can be traced back to ''[[Rumpi Hills]]'' in [[Ndian]] and ''Kupe Hills'' in Meme divisions. The people of Balondo do not recognize Balondo ba-Nanga and Balondo ba-Diko as part of their ethnic group\u00a0 because both names were used in stories by a [[Ngolo language|Ngolo]] fiction writer who had never come into contact with the Balondo people in person.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bokus.com/bok/9781634985833/fundamentals-of-balondo-society/|title=Fundamentals of Balondo Society av Aja Oro (H\u00e4ftad)|website=Bokus.com|language=sv|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orokousa.org/history/|title=History|website=OCAUSA|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\nThe Balondo society comprises family and people living together in a close community structure. It includes parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and neighbors. The communities are [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]], which means they are matrilineal, and inheritance is traced to the mother's side, which is called ''Nwana a Timbaka O Mbusa Nyange'' in their\u00a0language.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Oro|first=Aja|title=Introduction to Balondo Studies|publisher=Balondo Cultural Heritage, Inc. and Bookstand Publishing|year=2020|isbn=978-1-63498-906-0|location=United States of America|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSocietal issues are dealt with and arbitrated by a committee of elderly men and women\u00a0called ''Batina-ba-Moki''.\u00a0The central chief is usually an elderly man called ''Muli,'' who manages the issues of the entire community, while the female chief called ''Muli-wa-Balana'' primarily manages women's affairs.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== New year ===\nThe traditional version of the Balondo-ba-Konja new year is called ''Litangua-la-Moki''. It is marked by a festival to celebrate Ovase Loba, the supreme being, and ''Bawu-ba-Balondo'', their ancestors. The festival opens with chants, incantations, and praises to God, and the ancestors, Bawu-ba-balondo, followed by invocations and pouring of libations to the ancestors. The purpose of the festival is to cleanse the communities of bad luck and make way for good fortune.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Marriage ===\nMarriage between a brother and a sister is forbidden in the Balondo home land. ''Boluka-wa-Ndabo'' or House Marriage is the practice of cousin marriages. Marriage normally begins with ''Manyuke-nyuke''. It is when children participate in the role-play of the structure of a family when playing house. The Manyuke-nyuke is followed by the actualization of marriage when the children grow into adults. Prior to the actualization of marriage, ''Ikumba-Muna'' takes place. It is the Balondo custom where the groom with his kinsmen visit the house of the bride to meet the parents and announce his intention.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe betrothing process is long and ceremonious. There is a\u00a0long waiting period, which is the period for the bride-to-be to attain puberty. This practice of [[child marriage]] has been abolished. In case both the bride and groom are of the same age, the waiting period is brief.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''Nkhuo'', or the \u201cfattening room,\u201d is an ancient marriage practice in\u00a0Balondo society. It is the practice where girls are prepared for womanhood. Girls are taken to the room during puberty, and acceptance in the room is a demonstration of virtue, sexual purity, and proven virginity. While in Nkhuo, girls\u00a0have to live without their families and trained by older women of the community.\u00a0They are given heavy meals to make them gain weight as in ancient times being fat was a sign of prosperity, fertility, and beauty. The Nkhuo period lasts for one month, after which the girl's family would\u00a0present her to\u00a0the groom and his family, well-wishers, and the community at large.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Dowry]] is a way of validating marriage among people of Balondo society. The dowry comprises clothes and food items, but no money. It is a token of the parents\u2019 effort in raising a suitable female child. At the time of betrothal, the child\u00a0in\u00a0past child marriages could not\u00a0influence the dowry process because of her age, but a mature bride-to-be can influence the process even in contemporary times. There are five interrelated stages of Balondo marriages: courting, asking for a girl's consent, working through a middleman, test of bride's character, and paying the bride dowry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Balondo language is called ''Londo'' by European [[Linguistics|linguists]]. Similar to the [[Linguistics|linguistic structures]] of European and American languages, Balondo\u00a0language\u00a0contains [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. The Balondo language belongs to the Congolese and Efik linguistic groups. The development of the Balondo language has played a critical part in the transition from the historical oral tradition to the modern writing down of important local texts, beliefs and stories, and other social, legal, and political documents and correspondence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kuperus|first=Julianna|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/The_Londo_Word.html?id=5nIOAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=The Londo Word: Its Phonological and Morphological Structure|date=1985|publisher=Belgique|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the World Classification of Languages Ethnologue, Londo is classified with Bantu, Lundu-Balong, Londo-Bananga, Londo-Badiko, and Oroko-West based on speculation. In Cameroon, it is popularly believed that Londo is linguistically associated with the [[Oroko language|Oroko dialect]]. However, the Londo alphabet and language is a different form in principal, fundamental structures, and is a fully developed language compared to most others.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hedinger|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/The_Manenguba_Languages_Bantu_A_15_Mbo_C.html?id=U9XyJVNJ5AsC&redir_esc=y|title=The Manenguba Languages (Bantu A. 15, Mbo Cluster) of Cameroon|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34911-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Customs ===\nThe young Balondo-ba-konja boys and girls, usually at the age of five years, have to undergo\u00a0unique body markings. These marks are generally elaborate body and facial designs. The markings include tiny cuts on both cheeks of boys and girls, which after healing create impressions on the skin.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere are marital customs that the Balondo practice. These are Boluka wa Ndabo, Manyuke-nyuke, Ikumba Muna, and Nkhuo. Bolukawa Ndabo or house marriage is between cousins. Marriage normally\u00a0begins with Manyuke-nyuke. It is when children partake in role-play of the family structure. Ikumba Muna is a tradition where the groom visits the girl's home to announce his intention in front of her parents. Nkhuo is the fattening room, which is a practice to keep a girl away from her family to prepare her for womanhood.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Balondo people consider dance as a celebration of life, work, and spirituality. ''Malle'', the Elephant dance, e''kpe'', the leopard dance, ''Jokei ewondo ya nwenya'', or dancing on live burning coals, ''owasa njanga'', stilt dancer, ''mondoa ria'', dancing up a coconut tree. Other dancing forms include ''mosembe'', ''amekoko'', ''liyangi'', ''ngomo ya betuli'', and ''rokombe'' are mostly performed by women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Food ===\nThe main food dishes in Balondo cuisine includes ''ekpang berembi'', ''ekpang bolingo'', ''ekpang njoki'', ''ekpang coco'', ''pamachop'', and ''sarara''. Fish, snails, eggs, shrimps, boiled yams, coco yams, and plantains are all part of Balondo cuisine. Other food items include mendo or foo-foo of pounded boiled red coco yams, yams, cassava, and befufu (gari or processed cassava flour). Mendo is a collective name for\u00a0 round balls of foo-foo that are eaten with Balondo soups, including otong, erikaikong, ofere  afang (erung), ofere oa iyeke (ogbono) fresh fish, mawuni (okro), ofere oa bove, and the mosuku. [[Animal husbandry]] is carried out on a small-scale. Goats, pigs, and chickens serve as a source of protein for the Balondo. But the primary source of protein is fish similar to most other coastal cultures.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nDuring the early settlements, [[pottery]], [[sculpture]], [[Jewellery|jewelry]], and [[body painting]] were prominent forms of arts in Balondo-ba-Konja society. A significant portion of arts belongs to the decorative art form. Most types of Balondo art have become a thing of the past, but body painting is still prevalent among the people. Body painting shows position and identity in society. ''Fembe'' is the practice of using a mixture of crushed white chalk and water to make delicate facial and bodily patterns for girls and women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Religion ==\nThe Balondo-ba-konja religious beliefs are based on the philosophy of ''[[creationism]]''. They believe in a supreme deity, Ovase Loba, who created them in a pool of water in the Congo known as ''Morimo''. Ovase Loba is believed to be a by-product of the pre-existing creative matter, and not an alpha and omega. They believe that their god created Balondo-ba-konja and other humans, animals, plants, land, and water in the Morimo.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Philosophies ===\nCreationism is the Balondo's religious philosophy. It is about how Ovase Loba created the Balondo people in a pool of water in the wilderness of the Congo. Mamoism is about the consciousness of people of the Balondo-ba-Konja. It is the need to be born and die a ''Morondo Kpaa'', regardless of external influences. Mephism is a philosophy put forward by the second son of Mesembe Oro. It is about how the Balondo society should be revamped without hurting its cultural norms or devaluing its people.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Balondo live in fifteen settlements in the South-west coastal region of Cameroon. The landscape comprises coastal [[mangrove swamp]]s to the north-west of [[Mount Cameroon]], forest reserves of the Mokoko River and Meme River in [[Ekondo-Titi]] subdivision, and two major palm plantations in Upper Balondo (Ekondo-Etiti subdivision) and Lower Balondo ([[Bamuso]] subdivision). Each town has access to rivers, beaches, estuaries leading to ''Ndongore'' or the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Neba|first=Aaron S.|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=_iUpyAEACAAJ&dq=aaron+neba+books&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL8_Dfxs3oAhWNDxQKHannBvkQ6AEIJDAA|title=Modern Geography of the United Republic of Cameroon|date=1987|publisher=Neba|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Neighbors ===\nThey have Cameroonian and [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] neighbors on all sides. The Oroko of Ngolo, Baima, and Batanga live to the north. Bakolle and Betika live to the south and southwest. Isangele and Rio-del-Rey live to the west.\u00a0The Barombi and the Oroko of Balue, Ngbandi (Mbonge) and Ekombe live to the east. The people of Bomboko, Bimbia, and Bakweri live to the south-east. The Nigerian neighbors are the [[Calabar]] people and Efu-Balondo, ethnic relatives of the Balondo, who live\u00a0to the\u00a0east of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] Delta.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe settled Balondo region experiences [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climate]] due to its [[Latitude|latitudinal positioning]] between 4.23 and 4.50 degrees North. They experience two distinct seasons, called ''Nayo'' (dry) and ''Nikukeh'' (rainy). The seasons are impacted by the north-west [[trade winds]] and south-west [[Monsoon|monsoon winds]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe weather remains hot and humid throughout the year, with high temperatures. There are light rains in the dry season that start in October and end in March; however, the rain is preceded by temperatures ranging from 20-35 degrees Celsius. During the rainy season, the average rainfall can amount to about 100 inches each year.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Economy ==\nMost of the Balondo people are [[farmer]]s and\u00a0[[Fisherman|fishermen]]. They mostly cultivate cocoa yams or ''bvende'', or ''beyo'', vegetables including ''mawuni okro''. Commercial fishing is common among the people of Balondo. The fishermen sail to fishing ports in [[Dugout canoe|dug-out canoes]] to exchange\u00a0food crops and other items of necessity for smoked fish. This practice is known as ''Beyunga''. Night fishing, ''Iyobi'', ''Ebu'' fishing, and ''Maroki'' fishing are\u00a0other non-commercial\u00a0forms of fishing meant for home consumption. Their economy is now\u00a0transitioning from self-sufficiency to dependency because of\u00a0[[palm oil]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] cash crop cultivation.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Epale|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/Plantations_and_development_in_western_C.html?id=TeVBAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Plantations and Development in West Cameroon 1885-1975: A Case Study in Agrarian Capitalism|publisher=Vantage Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York, USA|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBalondo-ba-konja people originated in the area of modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo. In early 1100's, fifteen Balondo principalities and their nominal rulers migrated from the shores of either\u00a0the Nyanga River or Luapula River to the town of [[Akwa Akpa]], a coastal town along the banks of Cross River known as Calabar today. After settling down, the place was named \u201c''Ideh'',\u201d their name for present-day Calabar. The [[Efik people|Efik]] people of Calabar called them ''Efut'' or strangers in their local language. This event of migration is known as the \u201c'''''first voyage'''''.\u201d The ''Mouri-Monene'', Balondo King, worked closely with the ''Muli'' or chiefs in-charge of all fifteen principalities to plan their strategy. The King prepared the people and instructed people to stock food and other supplies.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">Sama, N.M. Origins and Settlement of the Balondo: A Historical Survey. 1993. University of Yaounde, M.A. thesis</ref>\n\nThe \"'''''second voyage'''''\" in the year 1149 was forced due to the presence of predatory aquatic animals, including crocodiles and sharks. These animals searched for food in the Cross River, and Balondo was losing its people. They were a constant threat. Despite fighting these animals with spears, harpoons, traps, and fishing nets, the situation did not come under their control. It forced them to look for another location for settlement. Scouts were prepared and sent to search for a new homeland. These scouts traveled to the present day southwest coast of Cameroon, including the [[Bakassi|Bakassi peninsula]]. The scouts shared the news with the people, but a mutual consensus could not be reached. The king discouraged the migration, but the pro-migration Balondo refused\u00a0and safely relocated to the\u00a0maritime location\u00a0they discovered in Cameroon.\u00a0The Balondo who decided to stay in the original Balondo settlement in South Calabar are known today as\u00a0''Efut-Balondo.''<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Wars ===\nIn the 1700s, the Balondo were facing threats to the ownership of their lands. These threats were internal and external aggression. The quarrel between ''Nambuli'' and ''Nanguia'', two brothers, set the grounds for the first war over the ownership of the land. After irreconcilable differences, Nambuli relocated to a new settlement, which he named ''Ekondo-Etiti'' or the small universe. Before leaving, he told Nanguia that he could keep ''Ekondo-Enene'' or the greater world. The Lobe people did not approve of Nambuli's relocation there\u00a0as they believed it was a violation of the \u201cNon-Interference Act.\u201d The Lobe people asked Nambuli to leave, which he refused causing the onset of the first war with\u00a0Lobe. Nambuli was victorious. He forced the Lobe people to give up more land as a war indemnity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1725, the\u00a0Lobe declared war on Kumbe over the \u201c''Ise Nde'',\u201d a very fertile piece of farmland in Kumbe. People of Kumbe fought and recaptured the land and pushed Lobe back to their side of the stream. Kumbe raided Lobe again and confiscated Lobe's gigantic wooden gong. After these victories, they were given the title of \u201c''Machia Maliba''\u201d, or people who regarded\u00a0blood the same as water.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen these internal threats were addressed, the Balondo\u00a0nation found itself trapped in external aggression from Itoki (Bakundu), Bamusso (Bakolle), and the [[Germans]]. All principalities of the Balondo set aside their differences to fight these external threats. In the 1800s, Nambuli and the Ekondo-Enene fighters defeated the Itoki. In 1820, the threat from the Bakolle people was crushed by the King\u00a0of Boa and his fighters. Balondo people as a whole were allegedly defeated by the Germans in the 1880s, and they lost most of their land to them. The Germans used the land for plantations, consisting largely of bananas, rubber, and palms. The Balondo refused to work in the plantations, so the Germans used Ngolo, Balue, Ngbandi, Bakundu, and Ekombe people who now belong to the Oroko group formed in Kumba in 1973.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:African civilizations]]\n[[Category:Cameroonian people by ethnic or national origin]]\n[[Category:Cameroonian people]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Civilizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{orphan|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{short description|The Balondo is a small ethnic group residing along the southwest coast of Cameroon with ethnic relatives in South Calabar.}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group            = Balondo Civilzation\n| native_name      = Balondo-ba-Konja\n| native_name_lang = \n| languages        = Balondo, also known as Londo\n| religions        = Creationism with Ovase Loba as supreme deity\n| related_groups   = Efut-balondo, Congolese and Bakweri\n| Geographic location = South-West coastal region of Cameroon\n| population       = 7,000\n}}\n\nThe '''Balondo-ba-Konja'''\u00a0(pure Balondo) are\u00a0 a central [[West Africa|West-African]] people whose civilization is situated along the southwest maritime coast of [[Cameroon]].

At the time of betrothal, the child\u00a0in\u00a0past child marriages could not\u00a0influence the dowry process because of her age, but a mature bride-to-be can influence the process even in contemporary times. There are five interrelated stages of Balondo marriages: courting, asking for a girl\u2019s consent, working through a middleman, test of bride\u2019s character, and paying the bride dowry.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Balondo language is called ''Londo'' by European [[Linguistics|linguists]]. Similar to the [[Linguistics|linguistic structures]] of European and American languages, Balondo\u00a0language\u00a0contains [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. The Balondo language belongs to the Congolese and Efik linguistic groups. The development of the Balondo language has played a critical part in the transition from the historical oral tradition to the modern writing down of important local texts, beliefs and stories, and other social, legal, and political documents and correspondence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kuperus|first=Julianna|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/The_Londo_Word.html?id=5nIOAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=The Londo Word: Its Phonological and Morphological Structure|date=1985|publisher=Belgique|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the World Classification of Languages Ethnologue, Londo is classified with Bantu, Lundu-Balong, Londo-Bananga, Londo-Badiko, and Oroko-West based on speculation. In Cameroon, it is popularly believed that Londo is linguistically associated with the [[Oroko language|Oroko dialect]]. However, the Londo alphabet and language is a different form in principal, fundamental structures, and is a fully developed language compared to most others.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hedinger|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/The_Manenguba_Languages_Bantu_A_15_Mbo_C.html?id=U9XyJVNJ5AsC&redir_esc=y|title=The Manenguba Languages (Bantu A. 15, Mbo Cluster) of Cameroon|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34911-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Customs ===\nThe young Balondo-ba-konja boys and girls, usually at the age of five years, have to undergo\u00a0unique body markings. These marks are generally elaborate body and facial designs. The markings include tiny cuts on both cheeks of boys and girls, which after healing create impressions on the skin.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere are marital customs that the Balondo practice. These are Boluka wa Ndabo, Manyuke-nyuke, Ikumba Muna, and Nkhuo. Bolukawa Ndabo or house marriage is between cousins. Marriage normally\u00a0begins with Manyuke-nyuke. It is when children partake in role-play of the family structure. Ikumba Muna is a tradition where the groom visits the girl\u2019s home to announce his intention in front of her parents. Nkhuo is the fattening room, which is a practice to keep a girl away from her family to prepare her for womanhood.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Balondo people consider dance as a celebration of life, work, and spirituality. ''Malle'', the Elephant dance, e''kpe'', the leopard dance, ''Jokei ewondo ya nwenya'', or dancing on live burning coals, ''owasa njanga'', stilt dancer, ''mondoa ria'', dancing up a coconut tree. Other dancing forms include ''mosembe'', ''amekoko'', ''liyangi'', ''ngomo ya betuli'', and ''rokombe'' are mostly performed by women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Food ===\nThe main food dishes in Balondo cuisine includes ''ekpang berembi'', ''ekpang bolingo'', ''ekpang njoki'', ''ekpang coco'', ''pamachop'', and ''sarara''. Fish, snails, eggs, shrimps, boiled yams, coco yams, and plantains are all part of Balondo cuisine. Other food items include mendo or foo-foo of pounded boiled red coco yams, yams, cassava, and befufu (gari or processed cassava flour). Mendo is a collective name for\u00a0 round balls of foo-foo that are eaten with Balondo soups, including otong, erikaikong, ofere  afang (erung), ofere oa iyeke (ogbono) fresh fish, mawuni (okro), ofere oa bove, and the mosuku. [[Animal husbandry]] is carried out on a small-scale. Goats, pigs, and chickens serve as a source of protein for the Balondo. But the primary source of protein is fish similar to most other coastal cultures.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Arts and crafts ===\nDuring the early settlements, [[pottery]], [[sculpture]], [[Jewellery|jewelry]], and [[body painting]] were prominent forms of arts in Balondo-ba-Konja society. A significant portion of arts belongs to the decorative art form. Most types of Balondo art have become a thing of the past, but body painting is still prevalent among the people. Body painting shows position and identity in society. ''Fembe'' is the practice of using a mixture of crushed white chalk and water to make delicate facial and bodily patterns for girls and women.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Religion ==\nThe Balondo-ba-konja religious beliefs are based on the philosophy of ''[[creationism]]''. They believe in a supreme deity, Ovase Loba, who created them in a pool of water in the Congo known as ''Morimo''. Ovase Loba is believed to be a by-product of the pre-existing creative matter, and not an alpha and omega. They believe that their god created Balondo-ba-konja and other humans, animals, plants, land, and water in the Morimo.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Philosophies ===\nCreationism is the Balondo\u2019s religious philosophy. It is about how Ovase Loba created the Balondo people in a pool of water in the wilderness of the Congo. Mamoism is about the consciousness of people of the Balondo-ba-Konja. It is the need to be born and die a ''Morondo Kpaa'', regardless of external influences. Mephism is a philosophy put forward by the second son of Mesembe Oro. It is about how the Balondo society should be revamped without hurting its cultural norms or devaluing its people.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Location ===\nThe Balondo live in fifteen settlements in the South-west coastal region of Cameroon. The landscape comprises of coastal [[Mangrove swamp|mangrove swamps]] to the north-west of [[Mount Cameroon]], forest reserves of the Mokoko River and Meme River in [[Ekondo-Titi]] subdivision, and two major palm plantations in Upper Balondo (Ekondo-Etiti subdivision) and Lower Balondo ([[Bamuso]] subdivision). Each town has access to rivers, beaches, estuaries leading to ''Ndongore'' or the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Neba|first=Aaron S.|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=_iUpyAEACAAJ&dq=aaron+neba+books&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL8_Dfxs3oAhWNDxQKHannBvkQ6AEIJDAA|title=Modern Geography of the United Republic of Cameroon|date=1987|publisher=Neba|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Neighbors ===\nThey have Cameroonian and [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] neighbors on all sides. The Oroko of Ngolo, Baima, and Batanga live to the north. Bakolle and Betika live to the south and southwest. Isangele and Rio-del-Rey live to the west.\u00a0The Barombi and the Oroko of Balue, Ngbandi (Mbonge) and Ekombe live to the east. The people of Bomboko, Bimbia, and Bakweri live to the south-east. The Nigerian neighbors are the [[Calabar]] people and Efu-Balondo, ethnic relatives of the Balondo, who live\u00a0to the\u00a0east of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] Delta.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe settled Balondo region experiences [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climate]] due to its [[Latitude|latitudinal positioning]] between 4.23 and 4.50 degrees North. They experience two distinct seasons, called ''Nayo'' (dry) and ''Nikukeh'' (rainy). The seasons are impacted by the north-west [[trade winds]] and south-west [[Monsoon|monsoon winds]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe weather remains hot and humid throughout the year, with high temperatures. There are light rains in the dry season that start in October and end in March; however, the rain is preceded by temperatures ranging from 20-35 degrees Celsius. During the rainy season, the average rainfall can amount to about 100 inches each year.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Economy ==\nMost of the Balondo people are [[Farmer|farmers]] and\u00a0[[Fisherman|fishermen]]. They mostly cultivate cocoa yams or ''bvende'', or ''beyo'', vegetables including ''mawuni okro''. Commercial fishing is common among the people of Balondo. The fishermen sail to fishing ports in [[Dugout canoe|dug-out canoes]] to exchange\u00a0food crops and other items of necessity for smoked fish. This practice is known as ''Beyunga''. Night fishing, ''Iyobi'', ''Ebu'' fishing, and ''Maroki'' fishing are\u00a0other non-commercial\u00a0forms of fishing meant for home consumption. Their economy is now\u00a0transitioning from self-sufficiency to dependency because of\u00a0[[palm oil]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] cash crop cultivation.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Epale|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books/about/Plantations_and_development_in_western_C.html?id=TeVBAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y|title=Plantations and Development in West Cameroon 1885-1975: A Case Study in Agrarian Capitalism|publisher=Vantage Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York, USA|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBalondo-ba-konja people originated in the area of modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo. In early 1100's, fifteen Balondo principalities and their nominal rulers migrated from the shores of either\u00a0the Nyanga River or Luapula River to the town of [[Akwa Akpa]], a coastal town along the banks of Cross River known as Calabar today. After settling down, the place was named \u201c''Ideh'',\u201d their name for present-day Calabar. The [[Efik people|Efik]] people of Calabar called them ''Efut'' or strangers in their local language. This event of migration is known as the \u201c'''''first voyage'''''.\u201d The ''Mouri-Monene'', Balondo King, worked closely with the ''Muli'' or chiefs in-charge of all fifteen principalities to plan their strategy. The King prepared the people and instructed people to stock food and other supplies.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">Sama, N.M. Origins and Settlement of the Balondo: A Historical Survey. 1993. University of Yaounde, M.A. thesis</ref>\n\nThe \"'''''second voyage'''''\" in the year 1149 was forced due to the presence of predatory aquatic animals, including crocodiles and sharks. These animals searched for food in the Cross River, and Balondo was losing its people. They were a constant threat. Despite fighting these animals with spears, harpoons, traps, and fishing nets, the situation did not come under their control. It forced them to look for another location for settlement. Scouts were prepared and sent to search for a new homeland. These scouts traveled to the present day southwest coast of Cameroon, including the [[Bakassi|Bakassi peninsula]]. The scouts shared the news with the people, but a mutual consensus could not be reached. The king discouraged the migration, but the pro-migration Balondo refused\u00a0and safely relocated to the\u00a0maritime location\u00a0they discovered in Cameroon.\u00a0The Balondo who decided to stay in the original Balondo settlement in South Calabar are known today as\u00a0''Efut-Balondo.''<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Wars ===\nIn the 1700s, the Balondo were facing threats to the ownership of their lands. These threats were internal and external aggression. The quarrel between ''Nambuli'' and ''Nanguia'', two brothers, set the grounds for the first war over the ownership of the land. After irreconcilable differences, Nambuli relocated to a new settlement, which he named ''Ekondo-Etiti'' or the small universe. Before leaving, he told Nanguia that he could keep ''Ekondo-Enene'' or the greater world. The Lobe people did not approve of Nambuli\u2019s relocation there\u00a0as they believed it was a violation of the \u201cNon-Interference Act.\u201d The Lobe people asked Nambuli to leave, which he refused causing the onset of the first war with\u00a0Lobe. Nambuli was victorious. He forced the Lobe people to give up more land as a war indemnity.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1725, the\u00a0Lobe declared war on Kumbe over the \u201c''Ise Nde'',\u201d a very fertile piece of farmland in Kumbe. People of Kumbe fought and recaptured the land and pushed Lobe back to their side of the stream. Kumbe raided Lobe again and confiscated Lobe\u2019s gigantic wooden gong. After these victories, they were given the title of \u201c''Machia Maliba''\u201d, or people who regarded\u00a0blood the same as water.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen these internal threats were addressed, the Balondo\u00a0nation found itself trapped in external aggression from Itoki (Bakundu), Bamusso (Bakolle), and the [[Germans]]. All principalities of the Balondo set aside their differences to fight these external threats. In the 1800s, Nambuli and the Ekondo-Enene fighters defeated the Itoki. In 1820, the threat from the Bakolle people was crushed by the King\u00a0of Boa and his fighters. Balondo people as a whole were allegedly defeated by the Germans in the 1880s, and they lost most of their land to them. The Germans used the land for plantations, consisting largely of bananas, rubber, and palms. The Balondo refused to work in the plantations, so the Germans used Ngolo, Balue, Ngbandi, Bakundu, and Ekombe people who now belong to the Oroko group formed in Kumba in 1973.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[Category:African civilizations]]\n[[Category:Cameroonian people by ethnic or national origin]]\n[[Category:Cameroonian people]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Civilizations]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: comprises of \u2192 comprises (3), \u2019s \u2192 's (10)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balondo_Civilization"}
