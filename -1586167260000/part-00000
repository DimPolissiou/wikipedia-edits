PlayNET licensed their software to a new service, [[Quantum Link]] (Q-Link), who went online in November 1985. PlayNET shut down shortly thereafter.

The original Q-Link was shut down on November 1, 1995, while AOL grew to become the largest online service, displacing established players like [[CompuServe]] and [[The Source (online service)|The Source]].

The service was different from other online services as it used the computing power of the Commodore 64 and the [[Apple II]] rather than just a \"dumb\" terminal.

The program dated back to AOL's early days, when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat. AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms, and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate, and more lucrative than AOL's other services of the era. There were 33,000 community leaders in 1996.<ref name=\"wired1999\">{{Cite web|title = Inside AOL\u2019s \"Cyber-Sweatshop\"|url = https://www.wired.com/1999/10/volunteers/|website = WIRED|access-date = 2016-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period. While most community leaders moderated chat rooms, some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design, with as much as 90% of AOL's content being created or overseen by community managers until 1996.<ref name=journal>{{cite journal|title=\nAmerica Online volunteers: Lessons from an early co-production community|author=Postigo, Hector|date=2009-09-03|volume=12|issue=5|pages=451\u2013469|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/10314787/America_Online_volunteers_Lessons_from_an_early_co-production_community|doi=10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>\n\nBy 1996, [[ISP]]s were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access, which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access. Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme, it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October 1996. In order to return to profitability, AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising, resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhkt_fUrGOkC&q=unlimited+#v=snippet&q=unlimited&f=false|author=Munk, Nina|pages=82\u201388|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref>\n\nAfter unlimited access, AOL considered scrapping the program entirely, but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders, with scaled-back roles in creating content.<ref name=journal /> Although community leaders continued to receive free access, after 1996 they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL.<ref name=\"wired1999\"/><ref name=journal /> By 1999, there were over 15,000 volunteers in the program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Volunteers Sue AOL, Seeking Back Pay for Work|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/nyregion/former-volunteers-sue-aol-seeking-back-pay-for-work.html|date=1999-05-26|author=Napoli, Lisa|page=Section B, Page 10}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1999, two former volunteers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] by treating volunteers like employees. Volunteers had to apply for the position, commit to working for at least three to four hours a week, fill out timecards and sign a non-disclosure agreement.<ref name=\"priceonomics\">{{Cite web|title = The Aol Chat Room Monitor Revolt|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-aol-chat-room-monitor-revolt/|website = Priceonomics|access-date = 2016-02-02}}</ref> On July 22, AOL ended its youth corps, which consisted of 350 underage community leaders.<ref name=\"wired1999\"/> At this time, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation into the program, but it came to no conclusions about AOL's practices.<ref name=\"priceonomics\" />\n\nAOL ended its community leader program on June 8, 2005. The class action lawsuit dragged on for years, even after AOL ended the program and AOL declined as a major internet company. In 2010, AOL finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for $15 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/aol_settled_with_unpaid_volunt.php|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|title=AOL Settled with Unpaid \u201cVolunteers\u201d for $15 Million|author=Kirchner, Lauren|date=2011-02-10}}</ref> The community leader program was found to be an example of [[Co-production (society)|co-production]] in a 2009 article in [[International Journal of Cultural Studies]].<ref name=journal />\n\n=== Billing disputes ===\nAOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Account cancellation ===\nMany customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or \"save\" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or \"save\" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or \"save\" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum \"save\" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures.

The program dated back to AOL's early days, when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat. AOL provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms, and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate, and more lucrative than AOL's other services of the era. There were 33,000 community leaders in 1996.<ref name=wired1999\">{{Cite web|title = Inside AOL\u2019s \"Cyber-Sweatshop\"|url = https://www.wired.com/1999/10/volunteers/|website = WIRED|access-date = 2016-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> All community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period. While most community leaders moderated chat rooms, some ran AOL communities and controlled their layout and design, with as much as 90% of AOL's content being created or overseen by community managers until 1996.<ref name=journal>{{cite journal|title=\nAmerica Online volunteers: Lessons from an early co-production community|author=Postigo, Hector|date=2009-09-03|volume=12|issue=5|pages=451-469|journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies|url=https://www.academia.edu/10314787/America_Online_volunteers_Lessons_from_an_early_co-production_community|doi=10.1177/1367877909337858}}</ref>\n\nBy 1996, [[ISP]]s were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access, which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access. Even though AOL would lose money with such a pricing scheme, it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in October 1996. In order to return to profitability, AOL rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising, resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hhkt_fUrGOkC&q=unlimited+#v=snippet&q=unlimited&f=false|author=Munk, Nina|pages=82-88|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> \n\nAfter unlimited access, AOL considered scrapping the program entirely, but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders, with scaled-back roles in creating content.<ref name=journal /> Although community leaders continued to receive free access, after 1996 they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within AOL.<ref name=wired1999\" /><ref name=journal /> By 1999, there were over 15,000 volunteers in the program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former Volunteers Sue AOL, Seeking Back Pay for Work|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/nyregion/former-volunteers-sue-aol-seeking-back-pay-for-work.html|date=1999-05-26|author=Napoli, Lisa|page=Section B, Page 10}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1999, two former volunteers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging AOL violated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] by treating volunteers like employees. Volunteers had to apply for the position, commit to working for at least three to four hours a week, fill out timecards and sign a non-disclosure agreement.<ref name=\"priceonomics\">{{Cite web|title = The Aol Chat Room Monitor Revolt|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-aol-chat-room-monitor-revolt/|website = Priceonomics|access-date = 2016-02-02}}</ref> On July 22, AOL ended its youth corps, which consisted of 350 underage community leaders. <ref name=wired1999\" /> At this time, the [[United States Department of Labor]] began an investigation into the program, but it came to no conclusions about AOL's practices.<ref name=\"priceonomics\" />\n\nAOL ended its community leader program on June 8, 2005.

In 2010, AOL finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for $15 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/aol_settled_with_unpaid_volunt.php|publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|title=AOL Settled with Unpaid \u201cVolunteers\u201d for $15 Million|author=Kirchner, Lauren|date=2011-02-10}}</ref> The community leader program was found to be an example of [[Co-production (society)|co-production]] in a 2009 article in [[International Journal of Cultural Studies]].<ref name=journal />\n\n=== Billing disputes ===\nAOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]]. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.\n\nAOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[Consumer complaint|complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Account cancellation ===\nMany customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or \"save\" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or \"save\" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or \"save\" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum \"save\" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name=\"BBB-AOL\"/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name=\"pcworld.com\">{{cite magazine| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |magazine= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |archivedate=December 31, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13447232 |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.<ref>Popken, Ben.

After the shutdown of Lifestream, clicking \"Buddy Info\" does something that provides no information whatsoever about the selected buddy: it causes the [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] home page (www.aim.com) to be displayed.\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[List of S&P 400 companies]]\n* [[Adrian Lamo]] \u2013 Inside-AOL.com\n* [[AOL Explorer]]\n* [[AOL Radio]]\n* [[AOL RED]]\n* [[AOHell]]\n* [[ART image file format]] .art\n* [[Comparison of webmail providers]]\n* [[Dot-com bubble]]\n* [[List of acquisitions by AOL]]\n* [[Live365]]\n* [[Sessions@AOL]]\n* [[Truveo]]\n* [[David Shing]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n{{Commons category|AOL}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Coord|40.7308|-73.9914|type:landmark_region:US-NY|display=title}}\n{{AOL Inc.}}\n{{Verizon Media}}\n{{Portal bar|Companies|Business and economics|Internet|New York City|United States}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:AOL| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Dulles, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Companies based in New York City]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2009]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2009]]\n[[Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Internet service providers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Internet services supporting OpenID]]\n[[Category:Former Time Warner subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Web service providers]]\n[[Category:Pre\u2013World Wide Web online services]]\n[[Category:Companies in the PRISM network]]\n[[Category:1983 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Web portals]]\n[[Category:Verizon Media]]\n[[Category:2015 mergers and acquisitions]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "ref name", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL"}

The treaty however was [[Treaty|abrogated]] as France failed to provide the aid.\n\nIt was only under conquest that the islands came under French control in 1861. During the [[French Indochina|French colonial era]] [[C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island]] was made infamous for its [[Con Dao Prison|penal facilities]] and the notorious \"tiger cages\". Vietnamese and Cambodian nationalists and revolutionaries were sent here to serve their sentence for anti-French activities. Many Vietnamese Communist leaders were \"schooled\" on C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Island as well. \n\nThe French Indochinese government named the group of islands '''Poulo-Condore Islands''', a name that derives from the islands' [[Malay language|Malay]] name '''Pulo Condore'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulo Condore Group, Vietnam|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4954156&fid=6654&c=vietnam|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> (''pulo'' as a corruption of ''pulau'', meaning \"island\").\n\n==C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park==\nMany of the islands were given protected status in 1984 as part of [[C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park]]. This natural preserve was subsequently enlarged in 1998. Endangered species protected within the park include the [[hawksbill turtle]], the [[green turtle]], [[dolphin]]s,<ref>http://www.condaopark.com.vn/vn/gioi-thieu/gioi-thieu-vuon-quoc-gia-con-dao.html</ref> and the [[dugong]]. [[Ecosystem]]s represented in the park include [[seagrass meadow]], [[mangrove]] and [[coral reef]]s.\n\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park is working with the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) Vietnam to further protection in the marine areas, with programs to establish a Marine Protected Area that protects coral reefs, seagrass beds and species, while also developing sustainable nature-based ecotourism. The island's management is strongly geared towards sustainable use, hoping to learn from previous experiences in Vietnam and the region to balance development with conservation.\n\n== Ferry ==\nA new hydrofoil service from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u to C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o was started in February 2019. The service is a daily return and boasts that the ferry will operate year round, regardless of the weather. Travel time is 4-5 hours, departing V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at 8am and returning from C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o at around 2pm.\n\nTwo ferries operate between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland. There is a daily overnight hour ferry service from [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]] which, in addition to bringing passengers, serves as the main source of importing goods to the islands. The ferry operates on a daily basis, however in winter months the service depends largely on weather conditions as the seas between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland can be rough.\n\nIn 2016 a new ferry service primarily for passengers opened up between [[S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng]] and C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o, shortening the length of the journey to three hours. With the addition of a fast ferry to the islands, the islands have experienced an increase in tourism fueled mostly by domestic tourists who view C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o as a sacred place due to its history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conbeo.com/explore-vietnam/con-dao-island-ferry/|title=Con Dao Islands Ferry|website=conbeo.com}}</ref>\n\n==List of islands==\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Islands include 16 islands, with a total area of 76&nbsp;km\u00b2:\n\n* C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island or C\u00f4n S\u01a1n ([[Grande-Condore]]), Ph\u00fa H\u1ea3i, 51.52&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Little C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island (Petite-Condore), or H\u00f2n B\u00e0, Ph\u00fa S\u01a1n, 5.45&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u1ea3y C\u1ea1nh Island, or B\u00e3i C\u1ea1nh Island, Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a, 5.5&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Cau Island, or Ph\u00fa L\u1ec7 1.8&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u00f4ng Lan Island, or B\u00f4ng Lang, B\u00f4ng Lau, Ph\u00fa Phong, 0.2&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Vung Island, or Ph\u00fa Vinh 0.15&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Ng\u1ecdc Island, or Tr\u1ecdc Island, h\u00f2n Trai, Ph\u00fa Ngh\u0129a, 0.4&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u1ee9ng Island, or \u0110\u00e1 B\u1ea1c Island, \u0110\u00e1 Tr\u1eafng Island, Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa B\u00ecnh 0.38&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i Nh\u1ecf Island, or Th\u1ecf Island, Ph\u00fa An, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u01b0ng 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecbnh 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a 0.75&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u1ed9i, 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Anh Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng L\u1edbn Island\n* Em Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng Nh\u1ecf Island\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080322005213/http://artific.org/public/galleri_tag.php Con Dao photos]\n* The Kun Lun Shan islands are shown on sheet 11 of the [[Mao Kun map]] [https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7821rm.gct00058/?st=gallery Wu Bei Zhi at the Library of Congress]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258698786_Bin_o_Vit_Nam_-_Ti_nguyn_v_th_v_nhng_k_quan_sinh_thi_a_cht_tiu_biu?ev=prf_pub Vietnamese Sea and Islands \u2013 position Resources, and  typical geological and ecological wonders.

On the western slope of C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Island, there exist groups of outcrops of diorite and microgranite penetrated by big quartz bands [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258698786_Bin_o_Vit_Nam_-_Ti_nguyn_v_th_v_nhng_k_quan_a_cht_sinh_thi_tiu_biu_%28Vietnamese_sea_and_islands__position_resources_and_typical_geological_and_ecological_wonders%29?ev=prf_pub].\n\nThe island group is served by [[C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Airport]] situated on the largest island in the archipelago, [[C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island]].\n\n==History==\nFormerly a [[Khmer Empire]] territory known as ''Koh Tralach'', \u1780\u17c4\u17c7\u178f\u17d2\u179a\u17a1\u17b6\u1785  (\"Wax gourd Island\"), the islands were settled by the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] by the 17th century.\n\nOn June 16, 1702, the [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[East India Company]] founded a settlement on [[Pulo Condore (island)|Pulo Condore]] as an ''entrep\u00f4t'' for ships plying between India and China.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wong Tze-ken|first=Danny|title=The Destruction of the English East India Company Factory on Condore Island, 1702\u20131705|journal=Modern Asian Studies|date=September 2012|volume=46|issue=5|pages=1097\u20131115|doi=10.1017/S0026749X11000424}}</ref> Three years later, on 2 March 1705, the Vietnamese murdered the English agents, destroyed the factory, and expelled the remaining settlers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tegg|first=Thomas|title=London Encyclopaedia|year=1829|location=London|page=318}}</ref>\n\nDuring the internecine wars for the Court of Hu\u1ebf, the Nguyen Prince [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac \u00c1nh]] ceded the islands to France in the [[Treaty of Versailles (1787)]] in return for military assistance. The treaty however was [[Treaty|abrogated]] as France failed to provide the aid.\n\nIt was only under conquest that the islands came under French control in 1861. During the [[French Indochina|French colonial era]] [[C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island]] was made infamous for its [[Con Dao Prison|penal facilities]] and the notorious \"tiger cages\". Vietnamese and Cambodian nationalists and revolutionaries were sent here to serve their sentence for anti-French activities. Many Vietnamese Communist leaders were \"schooled\" on C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Island as well. \n\nThe French Indochinese government named the group of islands '''Poulo-Condore Islands''', a name that derives from the islands' [[Malay language|Malay]] name '''Pulo Condore'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulo Condore Group, Vietnam|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4954156&fid=6654&c=vietnam|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> (''pulo'' as a corruption of ''pulau'', meaning \"island\").\n\n==C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park==\nMany of the islands were given protected status in 1984 as part of [[C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park]]. This natural preserve was subsequently enlarged in 1998. Endangered species protected within the park include the [[hawksbill turtle]], the [[green turtle]], [[dolphin]]s,<ref>http://www.condaopark.com.vn/vn/gioi-thieu/gioi-thieu-vuon-quoc-gia-con-dao.html</ref> and the [[dugong]]. [[Ecosystem]]s represented in the park include [[seagrass meadow]], [[mangrove]] and [[coral reef]]s.\n\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park is working with the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) Vietnam to further protection in the marine areas, with programs to establish a Marine Protected Area that protects coral reefs, seagrass beds and species, while also developing sustainable nature-based ecotourism. The island's management is strongly geared towards sustainable use, hoping to learn from previous experiences in Vietnam and the region to balance development with conservation.\n\n== Ferry ==\nA new hydrofoil service from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u to C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o was started in February 2019. The service is a daily return and boasts that the ferry will operate year round, regardless of the weather. Travel time is 4-5 hours, departing V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at 8am and returning from C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o at around 2pm.\n\nTwo ferries operate between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland. There is a daily overnight hour ferry service from [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]] which, in addition to bringing passengers, serves as the main source of importing goods to the islands. The ferry operates on a daily basis, however in winter months the service depends largely on weather conditions as the seas between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland can be rough.\n\nIn 2016 a new ferry service primarily for passengers opened up between [[S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng]] and C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o, shortening the length of the journey to three hours. With the addition of a fast ferry to the islands, the islands have experienced an increase in tourism fueled mostly by domestic tourists who view C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o as a sacred place due to its history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conbeo.com/explore-vietnam/con-dao-island-ferry/|title=Con Dao Islands Ferry|website=conbeo.com}}</ref>\n\n==List of islands==\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Islands include 16 islands, with a total area of 76&nbsp;km\u00b2:\n\n* C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island or C\u00f4n S\u01a1n ([[Grande-Condore]]), Ph\u00fa H\u1ea3i, 51.52&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Little C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island (Petite-Condore), or H\u00f2n B\u00e0, Ph\u00fa S\u01a1n, 5.45&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u1ea3y C\u1ea1nh Island, or B\u00e3i C\u1ea1nh Island, Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a, 5.5&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Cau Island, or Ph\u00fa L\u1ec7 1.8&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u00f4ng Lan Island, or B\u00f4ng Lang, B\u00f4ng Lau, Ph\u00fa Phong, 0.2&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Vung Island, or Ph\u00fa Vinh 0.15&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Ng\u1ecdc Island, or Tr\u1ecdc Island, h\u00f2n Trai, Ph\u00fa Ngh\u0129a, 0.4&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u1ee9ng Island, or \u0110\u00e1 B\u1ea1c Island, \u0110\u00e1 Tr\u1eafng Island, Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa B\u00ecnh 0.38&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i Nh\u1ecf Island, or Th\u1ecf Island, Ph\u00fa An, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u01b0ng 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecbnh 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a 0.75&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u1ed9i, 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Anh Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng L\u1edbn Island\n* Em Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng Nh\u1ecf Island\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080322005213/http://artific.org/public/galleri_tag.php Con Dao photos]\n* The Kun Lun Shan islands are shown on sheet 11 of the [[Mao Kun map]] [https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7821rm.gct00058/?st=gallery Wu Bei Zhi at the Library of Congress]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258698786_Bin_o_Vit_Nam_-_Ti_nguyn_v_th_v_nhng_k_quan_sinh_thi_a_cht_tiu_biu?ev=prf_pub Vietnamese Sea and Islands \u2013 position Resources, and  typical geological and ecological wonders.

He is best known for being the [[Commanding officer|Commanding General]] of the [[Ninth United States Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|northwest Europe]] during World War II.\n\nA graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], where he was ranked 101st out of 103 in the class of 1909, Simpson served in the Philippines, where he participated in suppression of the [[Moro Rebellion]], and in Mexico with the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] in 1916. During [[World War I]] he saw active service in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on the staff of the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd Division]], for which he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Silver Citation Star]]. Between the wars he served on staff postings, attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Command and General Staff College]] and the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], and commanded the 3rd Battalion, [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry Regiment]].\n\nDuring World War II he commanded the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] and was the assistant division commander of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]]. In succession he commanded the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th]] and the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Divisions]], the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]], and the [[Second United States Army|Fourth Army]]. In May 1944, with the [[three-star rank]] of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], he assumed command of the [[Ninth United States Army|Ninth Army]]. Simpson led the Ninth Army in the assault on [[Brest, France|Brest]] in September 1944, and the advance to the [[Roer River]] in November. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December, Simpson's Ninth Army came under command of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s Anglo-Canadian [[21st Army Group]]. After the battle was over in early 1945, the Ninth Army remained with Montgomery's 21st Army Group for [[Operation Grenade]], the advance to the [[Rhine]], and [[Operation Plunder]], its crossing. On April 1 the Ninth Army made contact with First Army, making a complete encirclement of the [[Ruhr]], and on April 11, it reached the [[Elbe]].\n\nAfter the war ended, Simpson commanded the [[Second United States Army]], and served in the Office of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff]]. He retired from the army in 1946. In retirement, he lived and worked in the [[San Antonio, Texas]] area. He was a member of the board of directors of the Alamo National Bank, and succeeded General [[Walter Krueger]] as the member of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of San Antonio. He died in the [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] on August 15, 1980, and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].\n\n==Early life and military career==\nWilliam Hood Simpson was born on May 18, 1888, at [[Weatherford, Texas]], the son of Edward J. Simpson, a rancher, and his wife Elizabeth {{nee}} Hood, the daughter of Judge A. J. Hood, a prominent lawyer.

He is best known for being the [[Commanding officer|Commanding General]] of the [[Ninth United States Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|northwest Europe]] during World War II.\n\nA graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], where he was ranked 101st out of 103 in the class of 1909, Simpson served in the Philippines, where he participated in suppression of the [[Moro Rebellion]], and in Mexico with the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] in 1916. During [[World War I]] he saw active service in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] on the on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on the staff of the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd Division]], for which he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Silver Citation Star]]. Between the wars he served on staff postings, attended the [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Command and General Staff College]] and the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], and commanded the 3rd Battalion, [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry Regiment]].\n\nDuring World War II he commanded the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] and was the assistant division commander of the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]]. In succession he commanded the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th]] and the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Divisions]], the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]], and the [[Second United States Army|Fourth Army]]. In May 1944, with the [[three-star rank]] of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], he assumed command of the [[Ninth United States Army|Ninth Army]]. Simpson led the Ninth Army in the assault on [[Brest, France|Brest]] in September 1944, and the advance to the [[Roer River]] in November. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December, Simpson's Ninth Army came under command of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s Anglo-Canadian [[21st Army Group]]. After the battle was over in early 1945, the Ninth Army remained with Montgomery's 21st Army Group for [[Operation Grenade]], the advance to the [[Rhine]], and [[Operation Plunder]], its crossing. On April 1 the Ninth Army made contact with First Army, making a complete encirclement of the [[Ruhr]], and on April 11, it reached the [[Elbe]].\n\nAfter the war ended, Simpson commanded the [[Second United States Army]], and served in the Office of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff]]. He retired from the army in 1946. In retirement, he lived and worked in the [[San Antonio, Texas]] area. He was a member of the board of directors of the Alamo National Bank, and succeeded General [[Walter Krueger]] as the member of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce of San Antonio. He died in the [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] on August 15, 1980, and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].\n\n==Early life and military career==\nWilliam Hood Simpson was born on May 18, 1888, at [[Weatherford, Texas]], the son of Edward J. Simpson, a rancher, and his wife Elizabeth {{nee}} Hood, the daughter of Judge A. J. Hood, a prominent lawyer. His father and uncle had fought with the [[Confederate Army]] under [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] in the [[American Civil War]]. He lived in Weatherford until he was five or six years old, when the family moved to Hood's ranch near [[Aledo, Texas]]. He did not start school until he was eight years old, when he started riding a horse several miles each day to the local school in Aledo.{{sfn|Stone|1971|pp=6\u20137}}<ref name=\"oral A\">{{cite web |url=https://digital.utsa.edu/4db237c1-a492-461a-b3b0-8c7e8bbf13ac |access-date=March 20, 2020 |title=General William Hood Simpson, United States Army, Retired |first=Ruth C. |last=Buerkle |date=June 30, 1976 |publisher=Bexar County Historical Commission Oral History Program }}</ref> He attended Hughey Turner Training School, a [[college-preparatory school]], where he played [[high school football]],{{sfn|Bartoli|McClurkin|2012|p=59}} but did not graduate.<ref name=\"oral B\">{{cite web |url=https://digital.utsa.edu/71c77dd7-b910-4ec8-b573-c139d2bfb95c |access-date=March 20, 2020 |title=General William Hood Simpson, United States Army, Retired |first=Ruth C. |last=Buerkle |date=July 7, 1976 |publisher=Bexar County Historical Commission Oral History Program }}</ref>\n\nSimpson decided to pursue a military career and attend the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. He was friends with [[Fritz G. Lanham]], the son of [[S. W. T. Lanham|Samuel Lanham]], the [[Governor of Texas]] (and a former law partner of Hood). Through Lanham he was able to secure an appointment from his local [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]], [[Oscar W. Gillespie]]. Competition was not fierce; only one other boy applied. As Simpson's academic credits were insufficient to qualify for automatic admission, Simpson had to sit an [[entrance examination]] at [[Fort Sam Houston]] in May 1905. A physical examination was conducted while he was there. He passed both, and was accepted into the class of 1909.<ref name=\"oral A\" />{{sfn|Stone|1971|pp=5\u201311}}\n\nOn June 14, 1905, a month after he turned 17, Simpson entered West Point.{{sfn|Stone|1971|p=14}} He found the curriculum difficult, and by the end of his first year, he stood 116th in a class that now numbered 120; 29 members of the class had dropped out.{{sfn|Stone|1971|p=23}} He was poor at mathematics, but excelled at [[equitation]], and by the end of his second year his standing had risen to 107th out of 108, soaring to 100th out of 107 by the end of his third.{{sfn|Stone|1971|pp=26\u201329}} When eight cadets, two of whom were from the class of 1909, were found guilty of [[hazing]] and suspended,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=San Francisco Call |title=Cadets Dismissed from West Point |volume=104 |issue=84 |date=August 23, 1908 |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC19080823.2.99.6&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 |access-date=March 21, 2020 }}</ref> it fell to Simpson, as a cadet captain, to escort them from the academy grounds.{{sfn|Stone|1971|pp=30\u201332}} Simpson graduated on June 11, 1909, ranked 101st out of 103 in his class, and was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]].{{sfn|Cullum|1920|p=1466}} Fellow members of his class included [[Jacob L.

Accessed 2009-Apr-09 at https://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2012/07/02/the-festival-of-the-maiuma-at-antioch/</ref> The Floralia opened with theatrical performances. In the Floralia, [[Ovid]] says that [[hare]]s and [[goat]]s were released as part of the festivities. [[Persius]] writes that crowds were pelted with [[vetch]]es, beans, and [[lupin]]s. A ritual called the ''Florifertum'' was performed on either 27 April or 3 May,<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 249.</ref><ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], 81 in the edition of Lindsay.</ref> during which a bundle of wheat ears was carried into a shrine, though it is not clear if this devotion was made to Flora or [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]].<ref>P.Wissowa, ''Religion und Kultus der R\u00f6mer'', 1912, M\u00fcnchen ; H.Le Bonniec, ''Le culte de C\u00e9r\u00e8s \u00e0 Rome des origines \u00e0 la fin de la R\u00e9publique'', 1958, Paris; Kurt Latte, ''R\u00f6mische Religionsgeschichte'' , 1960, Leipzig; P.Pouthier, ''Ops et la conception divine de l\u2019abondance dans la religion romaine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la mort d\u2019Auguste'', BEFAR 242, 1981, Rome.</ref><ref>Kurt Latte, ''R\u00f6mische Religionsgeschichte'' , 1960, Leipzig.</ref> Floralia concluded with [[Roman Empire#Recreation and spectacles|competitive events and spectacles]], and a sacrifice to Flora.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 110.</ref>\n\nMaiouma was celebrated at least as early as the 2nd century AD, when records show expenses for the month-long festival were appropriated by Emperor [[Commodus]].<ref name=Antiochopedia/> According to the 6th-century chronicles of [[John Malalas]], the Maiouma was a \"nocturnal dramatic festival, held every three years and known as Orgies, that is, the Mysteries of [[Dionysus]] and [[Aphrodite]]\" and that it was \"known as the Maioumas because it is celebrated in the month of May-Artemisios\". During this time, enough money was set aside by the government for torches, lights, and other expenses to cover a thirty-day festival of \"all-night revels.\"<ref>Malalas, Chronicle 284-285</ref> The Maiouma was celebrated with splendorous banquets and offerings. Its reputation for licentiousness caused it to be suppressed during the reign of Emperor [[Constantine]], though a less debauched version of it was briefly restored during the reigns of Arcadius and Honorius, only to be suppressed again during the same period.<ref name=\"Antiochopedia\">Christopher Ecclestone. 2009.

First attested in 900 AD, the celebration mainly focused on the symbolic use of fire to bless cattle and other livestock as they were moved to summer pastures. This custom continued into the early 19th century, during which time cattle would be made to jump over fires to protect their milk from being stolen by [[Fairy|fairies]]. People would also leap over the fires for luck.<ref name=\"hutton\">Hutton, Ronald. ''The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain''. Oxford University Press, 1996. pp.&nbsp;218\u2013225</ref>\n\nSince the 18th century, many [[Roman Catholic]]s have observed May \u2013 and May Day \u2013 with various [[May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10542a.htm |title=Special Devotions for Months |date=1911 |website=The Catholic Encyclopedia |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>  In works of art, school skits, and so forth, Mary's head will often be adorned with flowers in a [[May crowning]]. 1 May is also one of two feast days of the Catholic patron saint of workers [[St Joseph the Worker]], a carpenter, husband to [[Mother Mary]], and surrogate father of [[Jesus]].<ref name=\"EncyBrit\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306336/Saint-Joseph#ref1133736 |title=Saint Joseph |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=26 July 2014}}</ref> Replacing another feast to St. Joseph, this date was chosen by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955 as a counterpoint to the communist [[International Workers Day]] celebrations on May Day.<ref name=EncyBrit />\n\nThe best known modern May Day traditions, observed both in Europe and North America, include dancing around the [[maypole]] and crowning the [[Queen of May]]. Fading in popularity since the late 20th century is the tradition of giving of \"May baskets,\" small baskets of sweets or flowers, usually left anonymously on neighbours' doorsteps.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6mc7NCgm9U4J:www.seedsofknowledge.com/holidays/maybaskets.html |title=Charming May Day Baskets |date=12 April 2014 |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928172137/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3A6mc7NCgm9U4J%3Awww.seedsofknowledge.com%2Fholidays%2Fmaybaskets.html |archive-date=28 September 2018 |access-date=1 May 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many [[neopagan]]s began reconstructing some of the older pagan festivals and combining them with more recently developed European secular and Catholic traditions, and celebrating May Day as a pagan religious festival.<ref>E.g. [https://vancouversun.com/news/Todd+dancing+celebrates+pagan+fertility/6554073/story.html Douglas Todd: \"May Day dancing celebrates neo-pagan fertility\", ''Vancouver Sun'', 1 May 2012]: accessed 8 May 2014</ref>\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\nOn May Day, [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarians]] celebrate Irminden (or Yeremiya, Eremiya, Irima, Zamski den). The holiday is associated with snakes and lizards and rituals are made in order to protect people from them. The name of the holiday comes from the prophet [[Jeremiah]], but its origins are most probably pagan.\n\nIt is said that on the days of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste|Holy Forty]] or [[Annunciation]] snakes come out of their burrows, and on Irminden their king comes out. Old people believe that those working in the fields on this day will be bitten by a snake in summer.\n\nIn western Bulgaria people light fires, jump over them and make noises to scare snakes. Another custom is to prepare \"podnici\" (special clay pots made for baking bread).\n\nThis day is especially observed by pregnant women so that their offspring do not catch \"yeremiya\" \u2014 an illness due to evil powers.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn [[Czech Republic]], May Day is traditionally considered as a holiday of love and May as a month of love. The celebrations of spring are held on April 30 when a maypole (\"m\u00e1jka\" in Czech) is erected \u2014 a tradition possibly connected to Beltane, since bonfires are also lit on that day. The event is similar to German Walpurgisnacht, its public holiday on April 30.\nOn 31 May, the maypole is taken down in an event called Maypole Felling.\n\nOn 1 May, couples in love are kissing under a blooming tree. According to the ethnographer Kl\u00e1ra Posekan\u00e1, this is not an old habit, it could originate around the beginning of the 20th century and probably in the urban environment, perhaps in connection with [[Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha]] with his poem [[M\u00e1j]] (whitch is in these days reciteing) and [[Pet\u0159\u00edn]]. A cherry, an apple or a birch is most often considered a suitable tree.\n\n=== Estonia ===\nMay Day or \"Spring Day\" (''Kevadp\u00fcha'') is a national holiday in [[Estonia]] celebrating the arrival of spring.\n\nMore traditional festivities take place throughout the night before and into the early hours of 1 May, on the [[Walpurgis Night#Estonia|Walpurgis Night]] (''Volbri\u00f6\u00f6'').\n\n=== Finland ===\nIn [[Finland]], Walpurgis night (''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}'') (\"{{lang|sv|Vappen}}\") is one of the four biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, [[New Year's Eve]], and [[Midsummer]] (''{{lang|fi|Juhannus - Midsommar}}'').<ref name=\"Williams2016\">{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=Victoria |title=Celebrating Life Customs around the World |date=21 November 2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781440836596 |page=217 |language=English |quote=During the Walpurgisnacht Walpurgisnacht, or Walpurgis Night, is one of the names given to the night of 30 April , the eve of Saint Walpurga's feast day that falls on 1 May.

The celebrations, which begin on the evening of 30 April and continue on 1 May, typically centre on the consumption of [[Sima (mead)|sima]], [[sparkling wine]] and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of ''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}''. Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students. Many ''{{lang|fi|[[gymnasium (school)|lukio]]}}'' (university-preparatory high school) alumni wear the black and white [[student cap]] and many higher education students wear [[Student boilersuit|student coveralls]]. One tradition is to drink [[sima (mead)|sima]], a home-made low-alcohol [[mead]], along with freshly cooked [[funnel cakes]].\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Lily of the valley 777.jpg|thumb|Lily of the valley]] \nOn 1 May 1561, King [[Charles IX of France]] received a [[lily of the valley]] as a lucky charm. He decided to offer a lily of the valley each year to the ladies of the court. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on 1 May. The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or dog rose flowers.<ref>[http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/labor-day May Day in France Timeanddate.com].</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Viktualienmarkt Maibaum Nahaufnahme 1999.jpg|thumb|right|''Maibaum'' in [[Munich]], Germany]]\n[[File:Maibaum1.jpg|thumb|right|''Maibaum'' in [[Bad T\u00f6lz]], Germany]]\nIn rural regions of Germany, especially the [[Harz]] Mountains, [[Walpurgisnacht]] celebrations of pagan origin are traditionally held on the night before May Day, including [[bonfire]]s and the wrapping of a ''Maibaum'' (maypole). Young people use this opportunity to party, while the day itself is used by many families to get some fresh air. Motto: \"Tanz in den Mai\" (''\"Dance into May\"'').\n\nIn the [[Rhineland]], 1 May is also celebrated by the delivery of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers to the house of a girl the night before. The tree is typically from a love interest, though a tree wrapped only in white streamers is a sign of dislike. Women usually place roses or rice in the form of a heart at the house of their beloved one. It is common to stick the heart to a window or place it in front of the doormat. In [[leap years]], it is the responsibility of the women to place the maypole. All the action is usually done secretly and it is an individual's choice whether to give a hint of their identity or stay anonymous.\n\nMay Day was not established as a public holiday until the [[Third Reich]] declared 1 May a \u201cnational workers\u2019 day\u201d in 1933. As [[Labour Day]], many political parties and unions host activities related to work and employment.\n\n=== Greece ===\n1 May is a day that celebrates Spring.\n\nMaios (Latin [[Maius]]), the month of May, took its name from the goddess [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] (Gr {{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b1\u03af\u03b1, the nurse}}), a Greek and Roman goddess of fertility. The day of Maios (Modern Greek \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac) celebrates the final victory of the summer against winter as the victory of life against death. The celebration is similar to an ancient ritual associated with another minor demi-god [[Adonis]] which also celebrated the revival of nature. There is today some conflation with yet another tradition, the revival or marriage of [[Dionysus]] (the Greek God of theatre and wine-making). This event, however, was celebrated in ancient times not in May but in association with the [[Anthesteria]], a festival held in February and dedicated to the goddess of agriculture [[Demeter]] and her daughter [[Persephone]]. [[Persephone]] emerged every year at the end of Winter from the Underworld. The Anthesteria was a festival of souls, plants and flowers, and Persephone's coming to earth from [[Hades]] marked the rebirth of nature, a common theme in all these traditions.\n\nWhat remains of the customs today, echoes these traditions of antiquity. A common, until recently, May Day custom involved the annual revival of a youth called [[Adonis]], or alternatively of [[Dionysus]], or of [[Maius|Maios]] (in Modern Greek \u039c\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf, the Son of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]). In a simple theatrical ritual, the significance of which has long been forgotten, a chorus of young girls sang a song over a youth lying on the ground, representing [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]] or [[Maius|Maios]]. At the end of the song, the youth rose up and a flower wreath was placed on his head.\n\nThe most common aspect of modern May Day celebrations is the preparation of a flower wreath from wild flowers, although as a result of urbanisation there is an increasing trend to buy wreaths from flower shops. The flowers are placed on the wreath against a background of green leaves and the wreath is hung either on the entrance to the family house/apartment or on a balcony. It remains there until midsummer night. On that night, the flower wreaths are set alight in bonfires known as [[St John's Eve|St John's fires]]. Youths leap over the flames consuming the flower wreaths. This custom has also practically disappeared, like the theatrical revival of Adonis/Dionysus/Maios, as a result of rising urban traffic and with no alternative public grounds in most Greek city neighbourhoods, not to mention potential conflicts with demonstrating workers.\n\n=== Ireland ===\nMay Day has been celebrated in Ireland since pagan times as the feast of [[Beltane]] (Bealtaine) and in latter times as Mary's day. Traditionally, bonfires were lit to mark the coming of summer and to grant luck to people and livestock. Officially Irish May Day holiday is the first Monday in May. Old traditions such as bonfires are no longer widely observed, though the practice still persists in some places across the country. Limerick, Clare and many other people in other counties still keep on this tradition, including areas in Dublin city such as Ringsend.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local/warning-issued-ahead-of-limerick-s-may-eve-bonfires-1-5044472 |title=Warning issued ahead of Limerick's May Eve bonfires |last=Hurley |first=David |date=2013-04-30 |publisher=Limerick Leader |url-access=subscription |access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy it is called ''Calendimaggio'' or ''cantar maggio'' a seasonal feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring. The event takes its name from the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin ''calenda maia''. The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Lombardy]], [[Emilia-Romagna]] (for example, is celebrated in the area of the ''Quattro Province'' or [[Province of Piacenza|Piacenza]], [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]], [[Province of Alessandria|Alessandria]] and [[Province of Genoa|Genoa]]), [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]]. This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an [[alms]]giving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit. Throughout the Italian peninsula these ''Il Maggio'' couplets are very diverse\u2014most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring. Symbols of spring revival are the trees ([[alder]], [[Laburnum anagyroides|golden rain]]) and flowers ([[Viola (plant)|violets]], [[rose]]s), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves. In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.\n\nCalendimaggio can be historically noted in Tuscany as a mythical character who had a predominant role and met many of the attributes of the god [[Belenus]].  In [[Lucania]], the ''Maggi'' have a clear auspicious character of pagan origin. In [[Syracuse, Sicily]], the ''Albero della Cuccagna'' (cf. \"[[Greasy pole]]\") is held during the month of May,  a feast celebrated to commemorate the victory over the [[Ancient Athens|Athenians]] led by [[Nicias]]. However, [[Angelo de Gubernatis]], in his work ''Mythology of Plants'', believes that without doubt the festival was previous to that of said victory.\n\nIt is a celebration that dates back to ancient peoples, and is very integrated with the rhythms of nature, such as the [[Celts]] (celebrating [[Beltane]]), [[Etruscans]] and [[Ligures]], in which the arrival of summer was of great importance.\n\n=== Poland ===\nIn [[Poland]], there is a state holiday on 1 May.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/29-polish-tradition/155-international-workers-day-may-day |title=May Day in Poland |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815142641/http://anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/29-polish-tradition/155-international-workers-day-may-day |archive-date=August 15, 2012 |access-date=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/poland/tp/polandholidays.htm |title=Poland's Holidays |access-date=1 May 2013}}</ref> It is currently celebrated without a specific connotation, and as such it is May Day. However, due to historical connotations, most of the celebrations are focused around [[Public holidays in Poland|Labour Day]] festivities. It is customary for labour activists and left-wing political parties to organize parades in cities and towns across Poland on this day. The holiday is also commonly referred to as \"Labour Day\" (\"\u015awi\u0119to Pracy\").\n\nIn Poland, May Day is closely followed by [[May 3rd Constitution Day]]. These two dates combined often result in a long weekend called \"Maj\u00f3wka\". People often travel, and \"Maj\u00f3wka\" is unofficially considered the start of the barbecuing season in Poland.  Between these two, on 2 May, though formerly a working day, there is now a patriotic holiday, the Day of the Polish Flag ([[:pl:Dzie\u0144 Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|Dzie\u0144 Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej]]), introduced by a Parliamentary Act of February 20, 2004. May Day has a public holiday, too.\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\"Maias\" is a superstition throughout Portugal, with special focus on the northern territories and rarely elsewhere. Maias is the dominant naming in Northern Portugal, but it may be referred to by other names, including ''Dia das Bruxas'' (Witches' day), ''O Burro'' (the Donkey, referring to an evil spirit) or the last of April, as the local traditions preserved to this day occur on that evening only. People put the yellow flowers of [[Cytisus striatus|Portuguese broom]]s, the bushes are known as ''giestas''. The flowers of the bush are known as Maias, which are placed on doors or gates and every doorway of houses, windows, granaries, currently also cars, which the populace collect on the evening of 30 April when the Portuguese brooms are blooming, to defend those places from bad spirits, witches and the evil eye. The placement of the May flower or bush in the doorway must be done before midnight.\n\nThese festivities are a continuum of the \"Os Maios\" of [[Galiza]]. In ancient times, this was done while playing traditional night-music. In some places, children were dressed in these flowers and went from place to place begging for money or bread. On 1 May, people also used to sing \"Cantigas de Maio\", traditional songs related to this day and the whole month of May.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c3I-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA138&lpg=RA1-PA138&dq=cantar+as+janeiras+e+as+maias&source=bl&ots=x7tH5pJAdE&sig=jgZGPvh_GLWqa1yxC5Lxuc48If4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wP2DUKrvJ4rD0QXX4oHwAw#v=onepage&q=cantar%20as%20janeiras%20e%20as%20maias&f=false O panorama: jornal litterario e instructivo de Sociedade Propagadora dos Conhecimientos Uteis]\n\n=== Romania ===\nOn May Day, the [[Romanian people|Romanians]] celebrate the ''arminden'' (or ''armindeni''), the beginning of summer, symbolically tied with the protection of crops and farm animals. The name comes from [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] ''Jeremiin\u016d d\u012dn\u012d'', meaning prophet [[Jeremiah]]'s day, but the celebration rites and habits of this day are [[apotropaic]] and [[pagan]] (possibly originating in the cult of the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]).\n\nThe day is also called ''ziua pelinului'' (\"[[mugwort]] day\") or ''ziua be\u021bivilor'' (\"drunkards' day\") and it is celebrated to ensure good wine in autumn and, for people and farm animals alike, good health and protection from the elements of nature (storms, hail, illness, pests). People would have parties in natural surroundings, with ''l\u0103utari'' (fiddlers) for those who could afford it. Then it is customary to roast and eat lamb, along with new mutton cheese, and to drink mugwort-flavoured wine, or just red wine, to refresh the blood and get protection from diseases. On the way back, the men wear [[lilac]] or mugwort flowers on their hats.\n\nOther apotropaic rites include, in some areas of the country, people washing their faces with the morning dew (for good health) and adorning the gates for good luck and abundance with green branches or with [[birch]] saplings (for the houses with maiden girls). The entries to the animals' shelters are also adorned with green branches. All branches are left in place until the wheat harvest when they are used in the fire which will bake the first bread from the new wheat.\n\nOn May Day eve, country women do not work in the field as well as in the house to avoid devastating storms and hail coming down on the village.\n\n''Arminden'' is also ''ziua boilor'' (oxen day) and thus the animals are not to be used for work, or else they could die or their owners could get ill.\n\nIt is said that the weather is always good on May Day to allow people to celebrate.\n\n=== Serbia ===\n\n\"Prvomajski uranak\" (Reveille on May 1st) is a folk tradition and feast that consists of the fact that on 1 May, people go in the nature or even leave the day before and spend the night with a camp fire. Most of the time, a dish is cooked in a kettle or in a barbecue. Among Serbs this holiday is widespread. Almost every town in Serbia has its own traditional first-of-may excursion sites, and most often these are green areas outside the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/celebrate-may-day-serbian-style-04-24-2017 |title=Celebrate May Day, Serbian Style |date=1 May 2017 |website=Balkan Insight |access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Spain ===\nMay Day is celebrated throughout the country as ''Los Mayos'' (lit. \"the Mays\")  often in a similar way to \"[[Fiesta de las Cruces]]\" in many parts of Hispanic America.  By way of example, in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the festival (''os maios'', in the local language) consists of different representations around a decorated tree or sculpture. People sing popular songs (also called ''maios'',) making mentions to social and political events during the past year, sometimes under the form of a converse, while they walk around the sculpture with the percussion of two sticks.

Both [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]] organise May Day festivals and rallies.  In [[Edinburgh]], the [[Beltane Fire Festival]] is held on the evening of May eve and into the early hours of May Day on the city's [[Calton Hill]].  An older Edinburgh tradition has it that young women who climb [[Arthur's Seat]] and wash their faces in the morning dew will have lifelong beauty. At the [[University of St Andrews]], some of the students gather on the beach late on 30 April and run into the [[North Sea]] at sunrise on May Day, occasionally naked.  This is accompanied by torchlit processions and much elated celebration.\n\n==== Wales ====\nIn Wales the first day of May is known as ''[[Calan Mai]]'' or ''Calan Haf'', and parallels the festival of Beltane and other May Day traditions in Europe.\n\nTraditions would start the night before (''Nos Galan Haf'') with bonfires, and is considered a ''Ysbrydnos'' or ''spirit night'' when people would gather [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] (''draenen wen'') and flowers to decorate their houses, celebrating new growth and fertility. While on May Day celebrations would include summer dancing (''dawnsio haf'') and May carols (''carolau mai'' or ''carolau haf'') othertimes referred to as \"singing under the wall\" (''canu dan y pared),'' May Day was also a time for officially opening a village green (twmpath chwarae).\n\n== North America ==\n=== Canada ===\nMay Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Qu\u00e9bec, New Brunswick and Ontario.\n\n'''Toronto'''\n\nIn Toronto, on the morning of 1 May, various Morris Dancing troops from Toronto and Hamilton gather on the road by Grenadier Cafe, in High Park to \"dance in the May\". The dancers and crowd then gather together and sing traditional May Day songs such as Hal-An-Tow and Padstow.\n\n'''British Columbia'''\n\nCelebrations often take place not on 1 May but during the Victoria Day long weekend, later in the month and when the weather is likely to be better. The longest continually observed May Day in the British Commonwealth is held in the city of [[New Westminster]], BC.

In the Floralia, [[Ovid]] says that [[hare]]s and [[goat]]s were released as part of the festivities. [[Persius]] writes that crowds were pelted with [[vetch]]es, beans, and [[lupin]]s.

This custom continued into the early 19th century, during which time cattle would be made to jump over fires to protect their milk from being stolen by [[Fairy|fairies]].

The holiday is associated with snakes and lizards and rituals are made in order to protect people from them. The name of the holiday comes from the prophet [[Jeremiah]], but its origins are most probably pagan.\n\nIt is said that on the days of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste|Holy Forty]] or [[Annunciation]] snakes come out of their burrows, and on Irminden their king comes out. Old people believe that those working in the fields on this day will be bitten by a snake in summer.\n\nIn western Bulgaria people light fires, jump over them and make noises to scare snakes. Another custom is to prepare \"podnici\" (special clay pots made for baking bread).\n\nThis day is especially observed by pregnant women so that their offspring do not catch \"yeremiya\" \u2014 an illness due to evil powers.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nIn [[Czech Republic]], May Day is traditionally considered as a holiday of love and May as a month of love. The celebrations of spring are held on April 30 when a maypole (\"m\u00e1jka\" in Czech) is erected \u2014 a tradition possibly connected to Beltane, since bonfires are also lit on that day. The event is similar to German Walpurgisnacht, its public holiday on April 30.\nOn 31 May, the maypole is taken down in an event called Maypole Felling.\n\nOn 1 May, couples in love are kissing under a blooming tree. According to the ethnographer Kl\u00e1ra Posekan\u00e1, this is not an old habit, it could originate around the beginning of the 20th century and probably in the urban environment, perhaps in connection with [[Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha]] [[and Pet\u0159\u00edn]]. A cherry, an apple or a birch is most often considered a suitable tree.\n\n=== Estonia ===\nMay Day or \"Spring Day\" (''Kevadp\u00fcha'') is a national holiday in [[Estonia]] celebrating the arrival of spring.\n\nMore traditional festivities take place throughout the night before and into the early hours of 1 May, on the [[Walpurgis Night#Estonia|Walpurgis Night]] (''Volbri\u00f6\u00f6'').\n\n=== Finland ===\nIn [[Finland]], Walpurgis night (''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}'') (\"{{lang|sv|Vappen}}\") is one of the four biggest holidays along with Christmas Eve, [[New Year's Eve]], and [[Midsummer]] (''{{lang|fi|Juhannus - Midsommar}}'').<ref name=\"Williams2016\">{{Cite book |last=Williams |first=Victoria |title=Celebrating Life Customs around the World |date=21 November 2016 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781440836596 |page=217 |language=English |quote=During the Walpurgisnacht Walpurgisnacht, or Walpurgis Night, is one of the names given to the night of 30 April , the eve of Saint Walpurga's feast day that falls on 1 May.

The celebrations, which begin on the evening of 30 April and continue on 1 May, typically centre on the consumption of [[Sima (mead)|sima]], [[sparkling wine]] and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Student traditions, particularly those of engineering students, are one of the main characteristics of ''{{lang|fi|Vappu}}''. Since the end of the 19th century, this traditional upper-class feast has been appropriated by university students. Many ''{{lang|fi|[[gymnasium (school)|lukio]]}}'' (university-preparatory high school) alumni wear the black and white [[student cap]] and many higher education students wear [[Student boilersuit|student coveralls]]. One tradition is to drink [[sima (mead)|sima]], a home-made low-alcohol [[mead]], along with freshly cooked [[funnel cakes]].\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Lily of the valley 777.jpg|thumb|Lily of the valley]] \nOn 1 May 1561, King [[Charles IX of France]] received a [[lily of the valley]] as a lucky charm. He decided to offer a lily of the valley each year to the ladies of the court. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on 1 May. The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or dog rose flowers.<ref>[http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/labor-day May Day in France Timeanddate.com].</ref>\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Viktualienmarkt Maibaum Nahaufnahme 1999.jpg|thumb|right|''Maibaum'' in [[Munich]], Germany]]\n[[File:Maibaum1.jpg|thumb|right|''Maibaum'' in [[Bad T\u00f6lz]], Germany]]\nIn rural regions of Germany, especially the [[Harz]] Mountains, [[Walpurgisnacht]] celebrations of pagan origin are traditionally held on the night before May Day, including [[bonfire]]s and the wrapping of a ''Maibaum'' (maypole). Young people use this opportunity to party, while the day itself is used by many families to get some fresh air. Motto: \"Tanz in den Mai\" (''\"Dance into May\"'').\n\nIn the [[Rhineland]], 1 May is also celebrated by the delivery of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers to the house of a girl the night before. The tree is typically from a love interest, though a tree wrapped only in white streamers is a sign of dislike. Women usually place roses or rice in the form of a heart at the house of their beloved one. It is common to stick the heart to a window or place it in front of the doormat. In [[leap years]], it is the responsibility of the women to place the maypole. All the action is usually done secretly and it is an individual's choice whether to give a hint of their identity or stay anonymous.\n\nMay Day was not established as a public holiday until the [[Third Reich]] declared 1 May a \u201cnational workers\u2019 day\u201d in 1933. As [[Labour Day]], many political parties and unions host activities related to work and employment.\n\n=== Greece ===\n1 May is a day that celebrates Spring.\n\nMaios (Latin [[Maius]]), the month of May, took its name from the goddess [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]] (Gr {{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b1\u03af\u03b1, the nurse}}), a Greek and Roman goddess of fertility. The day of Maios (Modern Greek \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac) celebrates the final victory of the summer against winter as the victory of life against death. The celebration is similar to an ancient ritual associated with another minor demi-god [[Adonis]] which also celebrated the revival of nature. There is today some conflation with yet another tradition, the revival or marriage of [[Dionysus]] (the Greek God of theatre and wine-making). This event, however, was celebrated in ancient times not in May but in association with the [[Anthesteria]], a festival held in February and dedicated to the goddess of agriculture [[Demeter]] and her daughter [[Persephone]]. [[Persephone]] emerged every year at the end of Winter from the Underworld. The Anthesteria was a festival of souls, plants and flowers, and Persephone's coming to earth from [[Hades]] marked the rebirth of nature, a common theme in all these traditions.\n\nWhat remains of the customs today, echoes these traditions of antiquity. A common, until recently, May Day custom involved the annual revival of a youth called [[Adonis]], or alternatively of [[Dionysus]], or of [[Maius|Maios]] (in Modern Greek \u039c\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf, the Son of [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]). In a simple theatrical ritual, the significance of which has long been forgotten, a chorus of young girls sang a song over a youth lying on the ground, representing [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]] or [[Maius|Maios]]. At the end of the song, the youth rose up and a flower wreath was placed on his head.\n\nThe most common aspect of modern May Day celebrations is the preparation of a flower wreath from wild flowers, although as a result of urbanisation there is an increasing trend to buy wreaths from flower shops. The flowers are placed on the wreath against a background of green leaves and the wreath is hung either on the entrance to the family house/apartment or on a balcony. It remains there until midsummer night. On that night, the flower wreaths are set alight in bonfires known as [[St John's Eve|St John's fires]]. Youths leap over the flames consuming the flower wreaths. This custom has also practically disappeared, like the theatrical revival of Adonis/Dionysus/Maios, as a result of rising urban traffic and with no alternative public grounds in most Greek city neighbourhoods, not to mention potential conflicts with demonstrating workers.\n\n=== Ireland ===\nMay Day has been celebrated in Ireland since pagan times as the feast of [[Beltane]] (Bealtaine) and in latter times as Mary's day. Traditionally, bonfires were lit to mark the coming of summer and to grant luck to people and livestock. Officially Irish May Day holiday is the first Monday in May. Old traditions such as bonfires are no longer widely observed, though the practice still persists in some places across the country. Limerick, Clare and many other people in other counties still keep on this tradition, including areas in Dublin city such as Ringsend.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/local/warning-issued-ahead-of-limerick-s-may-eve-bonfires-1-5044472 |title=Warning issued ahead of Limerick's May Eve bonfires |last=Hurley |first=David |date=2013-04-30 |publisher=Limerick Leader |url-access=subscription |access-date=2016-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn Italy it is called ''Calendimaggio'' or ''cantar maggio'' a seasonal feast held to celebrate the arrival of spring. The event takes its name from the period in which it takes place, that is, the beginning of May, from the Latin ''calenda maia''. The Calendimaggio is a tradition still alive today in many regions of Italy as an allegory of the return to life and rebirth: among these [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Lombardy]], [[Emilia-Romagna]] (for example, is celebrated in the area of the ''Quattro Province'' or [[Province of Piacenza|Piacenza]], [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]], [[Province of Alessandria|Alessandria]] and [[Province of Genoa|Genoa]]), [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]]. This magical-propitiatory ritual is often performed during an [[alms]]giving in which, in exchange for gifts (traditionally eggs, wine, food or sweets), the Maggi (or maggerini) sing auspicious verses to the inhabitants of the houses they visit. Throughout the Italian peninsula these ''Il Maggio'' couplets are very diverse\u2014most are love songs with a strong romantic theme, that young people sang to celebrate the arrival of spring. Symbols of spring revival are the trees ([[alder]], [[Laburnum anagyroides|golden rain]]) and flowers ([[Viola (plant)|violets]], [[rose]]s), mentioned in the verses of the songs, and with which the maggerini adorn themselves. In particular the plant alder, which grows along the rivers, is considered the symbol of life and that's why it is often present in the ritual.\n\nCalendimaggio can be historically noted in Tuscany as a mythical character who had a predominant role and met many of the attributes of the god [[Belenus]].  In [[Lucania]], the ''Maggi'' have a clear auspicious character of pagan origin. In [[Syracuse, Sicily]], the ''Albero della Cuccagna'' (cf. \"[[Greasy pole]]\") is held during the month of May,  a feast celebrated to commemorate the victory over the [[Ancient Athens|Athenians]] led by [[Nicias]]. However, [[Angelo de Gubernatis]], in his work ''Mythology of Plants'', believes that without doubt the festival was previous to that of said victory.\n\nIt is a celebration that dates back to ancient peoples, and is very integrated with the rhythms of nature, such as the [[Celts]] (celebrating [[Beltane]]), [[Etruscans]] and [[Ligures]], in which the arrival of summer was of great importance.\n\n=== Poland ===\nIn [[Poland]], there is a state holiday on 1 May.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/29-polish-tradition/155-international-workers-day-may-day |title=May Day in Poland |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815142641/http://anglopolish.com/index.php/en/archive/29-polish-tradition/155-international-workers-day-may-day |archive-date=August 15, 2012 |access-date=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/poland/tp/polandholidays.htm |title=Poland's Holidays |access-date=1 May 2013}}</ref> It is currently celebrated without a specific connotation, and as such it is May Day. However, due to historical connotations, most of the celebrations are focused around [[Public holidays in Poland|Labour Day]] festivities. It is customary for labour activists and left-wing political parties to organize parades in cities and towns across Poland on this day. The holiday is also commonly referred to as \"Labour Day\" (\"\u015awi\u0119to Pracy\").\n\nIn Poland, May Day is closely followed by [[May 3rd Constitution Day]]. These two dates combined often result in a long weekend called \"Maj\u00f3wka\". People often travel, and \"Maj\u00f3wka\" is unofficially considered the start of the barbecuing season in Poland.  Between these two, on 2 May, though formerly a working day, there is now a patriotic holiday, the Day of the Polish Flag ([[:pl:Dzie\u0144 Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|Dzie\u0144 Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej]]), introduced by a Parliamentary Act of February 20, 2004. May Day has a public holiday, too.\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\"Maias\" is a superstition throughout Portugal, with special focus on the northern territories and rarely elsewhere. Maias is the dominant naming in Northern Portugal, but it may be referred to by other names, including ''Dia das Bruxas'' (Witches' day), ''O Burro'' (the Donkey, referring to an evil spirit) or the last of April, as the local traditions preserved to this day occur on that evening only. People put the yellow flowers of [[Cytisus striatus|Portuguese broom]]s, the bushes are known as ''giestas''. The flowers of the bush are known as Maias, which are placed on doors or gates and every doorway of houses, windows, granaries, currently also cars, which the populace collect on the evening of 30 April when the Portuguese brooms are blooming, to defend those places from bad spirits, witches and the evil eye. The placement of the May flower or bush in the doorway must be done before midnight.\n\nThese festivities are a continuum of the \"Os Maios\" of [[Galiza]]. In ancient times, this was done while playing traditional night-music. In some places, children were dressed in these flowers and went from place to place begging for money or bread. On 1 May, people also used to sing \"Cantigas de Maio\", traditional songs related to this day and the whole month of May.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=c3I-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA138&lpg=RA1-PA138&dq=cantar+as+janeiras+e+as+maias&source=bl&ots=x7tH5pJAdE&sig=jgZGPvh_GLWqa1yxC5Lxuc48If4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wP2DUKrvJ4rD0QXX4oHwAw#v=onepage&q=cantar%20as%20janeiras%20e%20as%20maias&f=false O panorama: jornal litterario e instructivo de Sociedade Propagadora dos Conhecimientos Uteis]\n\n=== Romania ===\nOn May Day, the [[Romanian people|Romanians]] celebrate the ''arminden'' (or ''armindeni''), the beginning of summer, symbolically tied with the protection of crops and farm animals. The name comes from [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] ''Jeremiin\u016d d\u012dn\u012d'', meaning prophet [[Jeremiah]]'s day, but the celebration rites and habits of this day are [[apotropaic]] and [[pagan]] (possibly originating in the cult of the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]]).\n\nThe day is also called ''ziua pelinului'' (\"[[mugwort]] day\") or ''ziua be\u021bivilor'' (\"drunkards' day\") and it is celebrated to ensure good wine in autumn and, for people and farm animals alike, good health and protection from the elements of nature (storms, hail, illness, pests). People would have parties in natural surroundings, with ''l\u0103utari'' (fiddlers) for those who could afford it. Then it is customary to roast and eat lamb, along with new mutton cheese, and to drink mugwort-flavoured wine, or just red wine, to refresh the blood and get protection from diseases. On the way back, the men wear [[lilac]] or mugwort flowers on their hats.\n\nOther apotropaic rites include, in some areas of the country, people washing their faces with the morning dew (for good health) and adorning the gates for good luck and abundance with green branches or with [[birch]] saplings (for the houses with maiden girls). The entries to the animals' shelters are also adorned with green branches. All branches are left in place until the wheat harvest when they are used in the fire which will bake the first bread from the new wheat.\n\nOn May Day eve, country women do not work in the field as well as in the house to avoid devastating storms and hail coming down on the village.\n\n''Arminden'' is also ''ziua boilor'' (oxen day) and thus the animals are not to be used for work, or else they could die or their owners could get ill.\n\nIt is said that the weather is always good on May Day to allow people to celebrate.\n\n=== Serbia ===\n\n\"Prvomajski uranak\" (Reveille on May 1st) is a folk tradition and feast that consists of the fact that on 1 May, people go in the nature or even leave the day before and spend the night with a camp fire. Most of the time, a dish is cooked in a kettle or in a barbecue. Among Serbs this holiday is widespread. Almost every town in Serbia has its own traditional first-of-may excursion sites, and most often these are green areas outside the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/celebrate-may-day-serbian-style-04-24-2017 |title=Celebrate May Day, Serbian Style |date=1 May 2017 |website=Balkan Insight |access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Spain ===\nMay Day is celebrated throughout the country as ''Los Mayos'' (lit. \"the Mays\")  often in a similar way to \"[[Fiesta de las Cruces]]\" in many parts of Hispanic America.  By way of example, in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the festival (''os maios'', in the local language) consists of different representations around a decorated tree or sculpture. People sing popular songs (also called ''maios'',) making mentions to social and political events during the past year, sometimes under the form of a converse, while they walk around the sculpture with the percussion of two sticks. In [[Lugo]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lugopatrimonio.org/index.php/multimedia/videos/item/1976-maioslugo/1976-maioslugo |title=Festa dos Maios en Lugo}}</ref> and in the village of [[Vilagarc\u00eda de Arousa]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vilagarcia.es/turismo/galego/7_as_festas/maios.asp |title=turismo01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075810/http://www.vilagarcia.es/turismo/galego/7_as_festas/maios.asp |archive-date=18 May 2015 |access-date=7 May 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> it was usual to ask a tip to the attendees, which used to be a handful of dry chestnuts (''casta\u00f1as maiolas''), walnuts or hazelnuts.

The first of May is instead celebrated as [[International Workers' Day]].\n\n===United Kingdom===\n====England====\n[[File: Melmerby May Queen on Village Green - geograph.org.uk - 233648.jpg|thumb|May Queen on the village green, [[Melmerby, Cumbria|Melmerby]], England]]\n[[File: Maypole Dancing on Village Green - geograph.org.uk - 1628839.jpg|thumb|Children dancing around a maypole as part of a May Day celebration in Welwyn, England]]\n\nTraditional English May Day [[rite]]s and [[celebration (party)|celebrations]] include crowning a [[May Queen]] and celebrations involving a [[maypole]], around which dancers often circle with ribbons.

In February 2011, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] was reported to be considering scrapping the bank holiday associated with May Day, replacing it with a bank holiday in October, possibly coinciding with [[Trafalgar Day]] (celebrated on October 21), to create a \"United Kingdom Day\".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Curtis, Polly |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/04/may-day-bank-holiday-under-threat |title=Mayday for May Day: Bank Holiday May Move to 'Most Unexceptional of British' October Slot \u2013  Minister Says Swap Would Extend Tourist Season But Unions See Tory Plot to Get Rid of Workers' Day |date=February 4, 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the other Bank Holidays and common law holidays, the first Monday in May is taken off from (state) schools by itself, and not as part of a half-term or end of term holiday. This is because it has no Christian significance and does not otherwise fit into the usual school holiday pattern. (By contrast, the [[Easter]] Holiday can start as late \u2013 relative to [[Easter]] \u2013 as [[Good Friday]], if Easter falls early in the year;  or finish as early \u2013 relative to Easter \u2013 as Easter Monday, if Easter falls late in the year, because of the supreme significance of Good Friday and Easter Day to [[Christianity]].)\n\nMay Day was abolished and its celebration banned by [[Puritan]] parliaments during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], but reinstated with the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |title=The rise and fall of Merry England |publisher=Oxford university press |year=1996 |isbn=0-19-285447-X |edition=New |location=Oxford |pages=27\u20138}}</ref> 1 May 1707, was the day the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] came into effect, joining England and Scotland to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].\n\n[[File:John Collier - Queen Guinevere's Maying.jpg|thumb|<center>''[[Queen Guinevere]]'s Maying'', by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]]<br />\n<br />\nFor thus it chanced one morn when all the court,<br />\nGreen-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,<br />\nHad been, there won't, a-maying and returned,<br />\nThat Modred still in the green, all ear and eye,<br />\nClimbed to the high top of the garden-wall<br />\nTo spy some secret scandal if he might,</center><ref>''[[Idylls of the King]] : Guinevere'', [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], 1859</ref>]]\nIn [[Oxford]], it is a centuries-old tradition for [[May Morning]] revellers to gather below the Great Tower of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] at 6{{nbsp}}am to listen to the college choir sing traditional madrigals as a conclusion to the previous night's celebrations.

This is an emerging Durham tradition, with patchy observance since 2001.\n\n[[Kingsbury Episcopi]], Somerset, has seen its yearly May Day Festival celebrations on the May bank holiday Monday burgeon in popularity in the recent years. Since it was reinstated 21 years ago it has grown in size, and on 5 May 2014 thousands of revellers were attracted from all over the south-west to enjoy the festivities, with BBC Somerset covering the celebrations. These include traditional [[maypole]] dancing and morris dancing, as well as contemporary music acts.\n\n[[Whitstable]], Kent, hosts a good example of more traditional May Day festivities, where the Jack in the Green festival was revived in 1976 and continues to lead an annual procession of [[morris dance]]rs through the town on the May bank holiday. A separate revival occurred in [[Hastings]] in 1983 and has become a major event in the town calendar.

This is believed to be one of the oldest fertility rites in the UK; revellers dance with the Oss through the streets of the town and even though the private gardens of the citizens, accompanied by accordion players and followers dressed in white with red or blue sashes who sing the traditional \"May Day\" song. The whole town is decorated with springtime greenery, and every year thousands of onlookers attend. Before the 19th century, distinctive [[West Cornwall May Day celebrations|May Day celebrations]] were widespread throughout West Cornwall, and are being revived in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St. Ives]] and [[Penzance]].\n\n[[Kingsand]], [[Cawsand]] and [[Millbrook, Cornwall|Millbrook]] in Cornwall celebrate [[Flower Boat Ritual]] on the May Day bank holiday.  A model of the ship ''[[The Black Prince]]'' is covered in flowers and is taken in a procession from the Quay at Millbrook to the beach at Cawsand where it is cast adrift.  The houses in the villages are decorated with flowers and people traditionally wear red and white clothes.  There are further celebrations in Cawsand Square with [[Morris dancing]] and [[May pole]] dancing.\n\n====Scotland====\n\nMay Day has been celebrated in [[Scotland]] for centuries.

Both [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]] organise May Day festivals and rallies.  In [[Edinburgh]], the [[Beltane Fire Festival]] is held on the evening of May eve and into the early hours of May Day on the city's [[Calton Hill]].  An older Edinburgh tradition has it that young women who climb [[Arthur's Seat]] and wash their faces in the morning dew will have lifelong beauty. At the [[University of St Andrews]], some of the students gather on the beach late on 30 April and run into the [[North Sea]] at sunrise on May Day, occasionally naked.  This is accompanied by torchlit processions and much elated celebration.\n\n==== Wales ====\nIn Wales the first day of May is known as ''[[Calan Mai]]'' or ''Calan Haf'', and parallels the festival of Beltane and other May Day traditions in Europe.\n\nTraditions would start the night before (''Nos Galan Haf'') with bonfires, and is considered a ''Ysbrydnos'' or ''spirit night'' when people would gather [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] (''draenen wen'') and flowers to decorate their houses, celebrating new growth and fertility. While on May Day celebrations would include summer dancing (''dawnsio haf'') and May carols (''carolau mai'' or ''carolau haf'') othertimes referred to as \"singing under the wall\" (''canu dan y pared),'' May Day was also a time for officially opening a village green (twmpath chwarae).\n\n== North America ==\n=== Canada ===\nMay Day is celebrated in some parts of the provinces of British Columbia, Qu\u00e9bec, New Brunswick and Ontario.\n\n'''Toronto'''\n\nIn Toronto, on the morning of 1 May, various Morris Dancing troops from Toronto and Hamilton gather on the road by Grenadier Cafe, in High Park to \"dance in the May\".

{"title_page": "Gun safe", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}\n[[Image:Gun Safes.JPG|thumb|right|240px|An example (open and closed) of a typical gun safe.]]\n\nA '''gun safe''' is a [[safe]] for one or more [[firearms]] and/or ammunition for those guns. Gun safes are primarily used to prevent access to unauthorized or unqualified persons, for burglary protection, and, in more capable safes, to protect the contents from damage during a flood, fire, or natural disaster.  Access prevention is required by law in many places, necessitating a gun lock, metal gun cabinet, or gun safe.  Gun safes have largely replaced the gun cabinets made of fine stained wood with etched glass fronts used for display that were commonly used decades ago, although some gun safes are made to resemble such gun cabinets.\n\n==Features==\nGun safes may include additional security features such as fire or water protection, combination lock, digital lock, and [[fingerprint]] identification.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Mary Lynn|title=The design and evaluation of physical protection systems|date=2007|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080554288|edition=2nd}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=6mmbr|title=Buyers guide|url=http://www.6mmbr.com/gunsafes.html|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nElectronic locks as well as mechanical locks are available on many models of safes.  The highest reliability exists for mechanical locks, although they are often more time consuming to open than electronic locks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electronic Keypad vs Dial Combination|url=http://www.vaultandsafe.com/electronic_vs_dial.shtml|accessdate=26 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323094332/http://www.vaultandsafe.com/electronic_vs_dial.shtml|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Some mechanical combination locks have key locks, too, that lock the combination lock dial from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations in the hopes of unlocking the safe.\n\nSome safes use live locking bolt technology and pry resistant metal to ensure the secure protection of its contents against forced entry. Some safes provide only protection against smash and grab burglary and unwanted access from young family members at home or outside,<ref>{{cite web|title=Secure handguns in vehicles|url=http://securehandgunsinvehicles.com/|accessdate=26 Feb 2016}}</ref> while other safes provide additional protection against fire and flood and other natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gun Safes and Chaos Kits \u2014 Essential Preparation for Any Disaster|url=https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/gun-safes-and-chaos-kits-essential-preparation-for-any-disaster/|accessdate=26 Feb 2016}}</ref>\n\nVault doors are available for creating walk-in gun safes or vaults in a dedicated [[room]] or gun armory in one's home.  Such rooms are also sometimes used as a dual-use gun safe or [[Safe room|panic room]], or even as a dedicated shelter for use in the case of a tornado or hurricane.\n\nGun safes with a carved wood exterior (furniture safes) serve a primarily decorative purpose and resemble old gun cabinets used for displaying weapons in the past. Design characteristics may include wood veneer and very thick tempered glass.\n\nSome gun safes are designed to be hidden from obvious view.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hidden gun safe examples|url=http://safegunowners.org/4-clever-hidden-gun-safe-options-and-one-bad-idea/}}</ref> False walls with hinges located at one end of closets are also sometimes used to hide gun safes, although simply installing a gun safe in an existing closet with a door that closes can achieve much of the same advantages to prevent intruders from becoming aware of the existence of a gun safe.\n\nDepending on a place where the gun will be stored, different types of gun safes appeared: under the bed and bedside, in-wall, vehicle, cabinets, drawers, mirror, and nightstand.\n\nEvery gun safe requires a dehumidifier to prevent rust.\n\n== Gun safes in various countries ==\n\n===Australia===\nAll [[Australian states]] require that firearms must be locked in steel cabinets or safes, although wooden safes 'deemed not easily penetrable' are allowed for Category A and B weapons in all states, apart from [[Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Safe Gun Storage, State by State Overview\">[http://www.spika.com.au/stateregulations.html Gun Safe Overview], including links to State Legislation.</ref> In most states, the law states that the ammunition (and bolt if readily removed), must be stored either in a separate safe or in a separate locked section of the safe. It is a legal requirement that the safe is bolted to the wall or floor (with exceptions in most states for safes with a mass of greater than 150 kilograms). In addition, shooters in [[Western Australia]] must have double locks on their safes if the swinging edge of the door is greater than 500&nbsp;mm and less than 1500&nbsp;mm. Additional locks are required for safes with a swinging edge greater than 1500&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"WA Safe Gun Storage\">[http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Ourservices/PoliceLicensingServices/Firearms2/Firearmsstorage/tabid/1904/Default.aspx Western Australian Safe Gun Storage]</ref>   Police may inspect the storage facility before issuing a licence, and will make random checks to ensure that legislation is being complied with. The [[Sporting Shooters Association of Australia]] endorses this policy with its \"Secure your gun, Secure your sport\" campaign to increase firearm safety and prevent theft.\n\nRequirements vary when transporting firearms in vehicles in different states.  Most require that the gun is hidden from view, and locked so that it is not easily reached by an unauthorised person.  Firearms must be unloaded and the ammunition transported in another section of the car.\n\n===Ireland===\nAny person applying for or renewing their gun licence in Ireland must have a gun safe installed in their home. This was made law under the Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009.<ref>[http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/SI%20307%202009%20FIREARMS%20(SECURE%20ACCOMMODATION)%20REGULATIONS%202009.pdf/Files/SI%20307%202009%20FIREARMS%20(SECURE%20ACCOMMODATION)%20REGULATIONS%202009.pdf Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009]</ref> Safes must be tested to the British Standard BS7558. Additional requirements including monitored alarms are necessary for those with more than 3 guns.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nMany gun safes sold in the UK are tested to BS BS7558/92, the British Standard for gun safes. The British Home Office recommends that new cabinets should conform to this standard. Glass fronted cabinets are legal in the U.K, provided the security glazing comply with BS5544 requirements and have no more weak spots than a full steel cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Firearms security handbook|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/117636/firearms-security-handbook.pdf|accessdate=26 Feb 2016|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nIf citizens do not own a gun safe, according to 'Secure Storage', it is acceptable to remove the firing mechanism from the firearm and store it in a secure container. It is then required that you lock away the rest of the firearm.<ref>http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/7181</ref>\n\n===United States===\nSome gun safes in the United States are tested by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL). The ''least'' rigorous UL certification for safes is specified in the standard UL 1037 as Residential Security Container (RSC).<ref name=UL1037>{{cite web| title=UL 1037: Standard for Antitheft Alarms and Devices| url=http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=1037| work=[[Underwriters Laboratories]]| date=19 October 2009| accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>  RSC certification requires that the safe resist for five minutes expert attacks employing tools including screwdrivers, adjustable wrenches, pry bars, punches, chisels and hammers no heavier than 3 lb.<ref name=Silva/>\n\nMany gun safe manufacturers state that their gun safe is \"DOJ approved\". The state of [[California Department of Justice]] (DOJ) has required that any gun safe sold in California should be approved by the Regulatory Gun Safe Standards. This DOJ standard has now become a common rating for the classification of gun safes.  However, in 2012, a report appeared in ''[[Forbes]]'' written by the investigative attorney and physical security specialist [[Marc Weber Tobias]], presenting the results of his investigation into the quality of the security provided by eleven different models among three leading brands of gun safes sold in the U.S. through many retail outlets.  Eight models from one of the brands are said to conform to the DOJ standard.  Tobias reported that he and his colleagues found that all eleven models could be opened with one of a variety of simple implements and techniques, including bouncing and rapping, or insertion of paperclips, wires, drinking straws, screwdrivers, or brass strips that can be purchased from a hardware store.  Four of the models were unlocked by a three-year-old child.  (It was a fatality resulting from such an occurrence that led to the investigation.)

Gun safes are primarily used to prevent access to unauthorized or unqualified persons, for burglary protection, and, in more capable safes, to protect the contents from damage during a flood, fire, or natural disaster.  Access prevention is required by law in many places, necessitating a gun lock, metal gun cabinet, or gun safe.  Gun safes have largely replaced the gun cabinets made of fine stained wood with etched glass fronts used for display that were commonly used decades ago, although some gun safes are made to resemble such gun cabinets.\n\n==Features==\nGun safes may include additional security features such as fire or water protection, combination lock, digital lock, and [[fingerprint]] identification.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Mary Lynn|title=The design and evaluation of physical protection systems|date=2007|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080554288|edition=2nd}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=6mmbr|title=Buyers guide|url=http://www.6mmbr.com/gunsafes.html|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nElectronic locks as well as mechanical locks are available on many models of safes.  The highest reliability exists for mechanical locks, although they are often more time consuming to open than electronic locks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electronic Keypad vs Dial Combination|url=http://www.vaultandsafe.com/electronic_vs_dial.shtml|accessdate=26 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323094332/http://www.vaultandsafe.com/electronic_vs_dial.shtml|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Some mechanical combination locks have key locks, too, that lock the combination lock dial from turning, thereby precluding casual attempts by anyone with physical access to the safe from trying multiple combinations in the hopes of unlocking the safe.\n\nSome safes use live locking bolt technology and pry resistant metal to ensure the secure protection of its contents against forced entry. Some safes provide only protection against smash and grab burglary and unwanted access from young family members at home or outside,<ref>{{cite web|title=Secure handguns in vehicles|url=http://securehandgunsinvehicles.com/|accessdate=26 Feb 2016}}</ref> while other safes provide additional protection against fire and flood and other natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gun Safes and Chaos Kits \u2014 Essential Preparation for Any Disaster|url=https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/gun-safes-and-chaos-kits-essential-preparation-for-any-disaster/|accessdate=26 Feb 2016}}</ref>\n\nVault doors are available for creating walk-in gun safes or vaults in a dedicated [[room]] or gun armory in one's home.  Such rooms are also sometimes used as a dual-use gun safe or [[Safe room|panic room]], or even as a dedicated shelter for use in the case of a tornado or hurricane.\n\nGun safes with a carved wood exterior (furniture safes) serve a primarily decorative purpose and resemble old gun cabinets used for displaying weapons in the past. Design characteristics may include wood veneer and very thick tempered glass.\n\nSome gun safes are designed to be hidden from obvious view.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hidden gun safe examples|url=http://safegunowners.org/4-clever-hidden-gun-safe-options-and-one-bad-idea/}}</ref> False walls with hinges located at one end of closets are also sometimes used to hide gun safes, although simply installing a gun safe in an existing closet with a door that closes can achieve much of the same advantages to prevent intruders from becoming aware of the existence of a gun safe.\n\nDepending on a place where the gun will be stored, different types of gun safes appeared: under the bed and bedside, in-wall, vehicle, cabinets, drawers, mirror, and nightstand.\n\nEvery gun safe requires a dehumidifier to prevent rust.\n\n== Gun safes in various countries ==\n\n===Australia===\nAll [[Australian states]] require that firearms must be locked in steel cabinets or safes, although wooden safes 'deemed not easily penetrable' are allowed for Category A and B weapons in all states, apart from [[Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Safe Gun Storage, State by State Overview\">[http://www.spika.com.au/stateregulations.html Gun Safe Overview], including links to State Legislation.</ref> In most states, the law states that the ammunition (and bolt if readily removed), must be stored either in a separate safe or in a separate locked section of the safe. It is a legal requirement that the safe is bolted to the wall or floor (with exceptions in most states for safes with a mass of greater than 150 kilograms). In addition, shooters in [[Western Australia]] must have double locks on their safes if the swinging edge of the door is greater than 500&nbsp;mm and less than 1500&nbsp;mm. Additional locks are required for safes with a swinging edge greater than 1500&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"WA Safe Gun Storage\">[http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Ourservices/PoliceLicensingServices/Firearms2/Firearmsstorage/tabid/1904/Default.aspx Western Australian Safe Gun Storage]</ref>   Police may inspect the storage facility before issuing a licence, and will make random checks to ensure that legislation is being complied with. The [[Sporting Shooters Association of Australia]] endorses this policy with its \"Secure your gun, Secure your sport\" campaign to increase firearm safety and prevent theft.\n\nRequirements vary when transporting firearms in vehicles in different states.  Most require that the gun is hidden from view, and locked so that it is not easily reached by an unauthorised person.  Firearms must be unloaded and the ammunition transported in another section of the car.\n\n===Ireland===\nAny person applying for or renewing their gun licence in Ireland must have a gun safe installed in their home. This was made law under the Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009.<ref>[http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/SI%20307%202009%20FIREARMS%20(SECURE%20ACCOMMODATION)%20REGULATIONS%202009.pdf/Files/SI%20307%202009%20FIREARMS%20(SECURE%20ACCOMMODATION)%20REGULATIONS%202009.pdf Firearms (Secure Accommodation) Regulations 2009]</ref> Safes must be tested to the British Standard BS7558. Additional requirements including monitored alarms are necessary for those with more than 3 guns.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nMany gun safes sold in the UK are tested to BS BS7558/92, the British Standard for gun safes. The British Home Office recommends that new cabinets should conform to this standard. Glass fronted cabinets are legal in the U.K, provided the security glazing comply with BS5544 requirements and have no more weak spots than a full steel cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Firearms security handbook|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/117636/firearms-security-handbook.pdf|accessdate=26 Feb 2016|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nIf citizens do not own a gun safe, according to 'Secure Storage', it is acceptable to remove the firing mechanism from the firearm and store it in a secure container. It is then required that you lock away the rest of the firearm.<ref>http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/citation/quotes/7181</ref>\n\n===United States===\nSome gun safes in the United States are tested by [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL). The ''least'' rigorous UL certification for safes is specified in the standard UL 1037 as Residential Security Container (RSC).<ref name=UL1037>{{cite web| title=UL 1037: Standard for Antitheft Alarms and Devices| url=http://ulstandards.ul.com/standard/?id=1037| work=[[Underwriters Laboratories]]| date=19 October 2009| accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>  RSC certification requires that the safe resist for five minutes expert attacks employing tools including screwdrivers, adjustable wrenches, pry bars, punches, chisels and hammers no heavier than 3 lb.<ref name=Silva/>\n\nMany gun safe manufacturers state that their gun safe is \"DOJ approved\". The state of [[California Department of Justice]] (DOJ) has required that any gun safe sold in California should be approved by the Regulatory Gun Safe Standards. This DOJ standard has now become a common rating for the classification of gun safes.  However, in 2012, a report appeared in ''[[Forbes]]'' written by the investigative attorney and physical security specialist [[Marc Weber Tobias]], presenting the results of his investigation into the quality of the security provided by eleven different models among three leading brands of gun safes sold in the U.S. through many retail outlets.  Eight models from one of the brands are said to conform to the DOJ standard.  Tobias reported that he and his colleagues found that all eleven models could be opened with one of a variety of simple implements and techniques, including bouncing and rapping, or insertion of paperclips, wires, drinking straws, screwdrivers, or brass strips that can be purchased from a hardware store.  Four of the models were unlocked by a three-year-old child.  (It was a fatality resulting from such an occurrence that led to the investigation.)  When Tobias reported their findings to the manufacturers and retailers of the \"safes\", no useful dialog or corrective action resulted.  Tobias concluded that the DOJ \"Standards are woefully inadequate and do not address any of the issues that we found in any of the gun safes that we tested. If the Standards do not cover a method of entry, then they are meaningless.\"<ref name=ForbesGS>{{cite news| title=Unsafe Gun Safes Can Be Opened By A Three-Year Old| last=Tobias| first=Marc Weber| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcwebertobias/2012/07/27/unsafe-gun-safes-can-be-opened-by-a-three-year-old/| work=[[Forbes]]| date=27 July 2012| accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=DEFCON>{{cite web| title=Safes and Containers\u2014Insecurity Design Excellence| last1=Tobias| first1=Marc Weber| first2=Matt| last2=Fiddler| first3=Tobias| last3=Bluzmanis| url=https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-20/dc-20-presentations/Tobias-Bluzmanis-Fiddler/DEFCON-20-Tobias-Bluzmanis-Fiddler-Safes-and-Containers.pdf| publisher=[[DEF CON]] 20| date=27 July 2012| accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=YouTube>{{cite web| title=Gun Safe Report and Analysis| last1=Tobias| first1=Marc| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl7aczxgZlI| publisher=[[YouTube]]| date=27 July 2012| accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFireproof gun safes have an [[UL (safety organization)|UL classification]], and depending on the build of the gun safe, the inside must not get warmer than a certain temperature during a certain period of time.
