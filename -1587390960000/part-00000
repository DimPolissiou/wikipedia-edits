She and [[Mickey Mouse]] were first drawn by Iwerks in 1928. The [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] story \"The Gleam\" (published January 19 \u2013 May 2, 1942) by [[Merrill De Maris]] and [[Floyd Gottfredson]] first gave her full name as '''Minerva Mouse''', although this is seldom used.\n\nThe comic strip story \"Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers\" (published September 22 \u2013 December 26, 1930) introduced her father Marcus Mouse and her unnamed mother, both farmers. The same story featured photographs of Minnie's uncle Milton Mouse with his family and her grandparents Marvel Mouse and Matilda Mouse. Her best-known relatives, however, remain her uncle Mortimer Mouse (Mortimer was almost the name of Mickey) and her twin nieces, Millie and Melody Mouse, though most often a single niece, Melody, appears. In many appearances, Minnie is presented as the girlfriend of Mickey Mouse, a close friend of [[Daisy Duck]],<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/2000/minnievisitsdaisy.html Minnie Visits Daisy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224023232/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/2000/minnievisitsdaisy.html |date=2008-02-24 }}.

Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched [[knickers]].  In the 1929 cartoon ''[[The Karnival Kid]]'', it was also revealed that she wears black [[stockings]] which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her [[shoes]] are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled [[court shoe|pumps]] that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of her shoes, and she even loses her shoes completely in ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''. When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with the rhythm of the music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow, and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, her look and personality became more [[conservative]].  Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).\n\nMinnie's early personality is cute, playful, musical and flirtatious. She often portrays an entertainer like a dancer or a musician whose affection Mickey is trying to win.  Part of the comedy of these early shorts is the varying degree of success Mickey has in wooing Minnie.  Unlike later cartoons after the redesign, Minnie often becomes a [[damsel in distress]] whom Mickey tries to rescue.  She is also subject to a lot of [[slapstick]] and [[rubber hose animation]] gags.  Over the course of the 1930s, Minnie's and Mickey's relationship solidified and they eventually became a steady couple.\n\nMinnie was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short ''[[Plane Crazy]]''.<ref name=\"disneyshorts.org Plane Crazy\"/> Minnie is invited to join Mickey in the first flight of his aircraft. She accepts the invitation but not his request for a kiss in mid-flight. Mickey eventually forces Minnie into a kiss but this only results in her parachuting out of the plane. This first film depicted Minnie as somewhat resistant to the demanding affection of her potential boyfriend and capable of escaping his grasp.\n\nTheir debut, however, featured the couple already familiar to each other.

Both flirt with her but the latter intends to abduct her while the former obliges in saving the [[Damsel in distress|Damsel in Distress]] from the [[villain]]. All three characters acted as strangers first being introduced to each other.\n\nBut it was their third cartoon that established the definitive early look and personality of both Mickey and Minnie, as well as Pete.

Mickey then proceeds to explain his reaction to Minnie's call. The song firmly establishes Mickey and Minnie as a couple and expresses the importance Minnie holds for her male partner.\n\n===Damsel in distress===\nHer final appearance for the year was in ''[[Wild Waves]],''<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/wildwaves.html Wild Waves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704133940/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/wildwaves.html |date=2008-07-04 }}.

This is the second time Minnie is placed in danger and then saved by her new boyfriend. It would not be the last.\n\nIn fact, this was the case with her next appearance in ''[[The Cactus Kid (1930 film)|The Cactus Kid]]'' (May 10, 1930).<ref name=ultimate>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=J.B. |last2=Gerstein |first2=David |title=Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: The Ultimate History |date=2018 |publisher=Taschen |location=Cologne |isbn=978-3-8365-5284-4}}</ref> As the title implies the short was intended as a [[Western movie]] parody, but it is considered to be more or less a remake of ''The Gallopin' Gaucho'' set in [[Mexico]] instead of [[Argentina]]. Minnie was again cast as the local tavern dancer who is abducted by Peg-Leg Pedro ([[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] in his first appearance with a peg-leg). Mickey again comes to the rescue.

Horace Horsecollar is among the firefighters. An unnamed cow in the background is possibly Clarabelle making a cameo. The music of the short was, appropriately, the tune of \"[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]]\".\n\nThe next entry in the series is considered curious: ''[[The Gorilla Mystery]]'' (October 1, 1930).<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/gorillamystery.html The Gorilla Mystery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426215215/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/gorillamystery.html |date=2008-04-26 }}.

He phones Minnie to warn her about the dangerous gorilla wandering about. Minnie is unconcerned and plays tunes on her piano for Mickey to hear over the phone and know she is not afraid. Her tunes are interrupted by her scream and Mickey rushes to her house to save her. Meanwhile, Beppo has wrapped up Minnie in rope and holds her hostage. Mickey confronts the gorilla and once again rescues the damsel in distress.\n\n===Introduction of a pet===\nIn ''[[The Picnic (1930 film)|The Picnic]]'' (1930), Minnie introduces her boyfriend to her new pet dog, Rover. This is actually [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] making his first appearance as an individual character. Two unnamed bloodhound guard dogs strikingly similar to him had previously appeared in ''[[The Chain Gang]]'' (August 18, 1930)<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/chaingang.html The Chain Gang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410221545/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/chaingang.html |date=2008-04-10 }}.

Otherwise the short features a typical picnic excursion harassed by forest animals and brought to a premature end by a sudden rain.\n\nThe final appearance of Minnie during the year was ''[[Pioneer Days (1930 film)|Pioneer Days]]'' (November 20, 1930).<ref name=ultimate />{{rp|63}} The short featured Minnie and her mate as pioneer settlers heading to the [[American Old West]] driving a [[Conestoga wagon|covered wagon]] in a [[wagon train]]. They are unsurprisingly attacked by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on their way, a stock plot of [[Western movie]]s at the time. While their fellows are either subjected to [[scalping]] or running for their lives, Minnie is captured by the attackers. Mickey attempts to rescue her only to be captured himself. In a reversal of their usual roles, Minnie escapes her captors and rescues her mate. They then dress as soldiers of the [[United States Army]]. Their mere appearance proves sufficient to have the entire tribe running for the hills. The Mouse couple stands triumphant at the end. The short has been criticized for its unflattering depiction of Native Americans as rather bestial predators. The finale has been edited out in recent viewings for depicting the \"braves\" submitting to cowardice.\n\nIn several shorts, comics and TV shows, Minnie owns a black and white kitten named [[Figaro (Disney)|Figaro]], who had originated in the Disney animated feature ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n\n===Waning years===\nDuring the second half of the thirties, Minnie did not appear as often in Mickey cartoons. This was mainly due to the growth in popularity of Mickey's new sidekicks, [[Goofy]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], whose appearances in Mickey cartoons had more or less replaced Minnie's role. Minnie's appearances in Mickey cartoons thus became less numerous, but she did have a few major roles in some Pluto and [[Figaro (Disney)|Figaro]] cartoons during the 1940s.

During ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', when Pete's tampering of the past causes the Heartless to appear in Disney Castle, Minnie is forced to fall back to the library until Sora and company arrive. While Donald and Goofy head to get the other residents to safety, Sora serves as the Queen's bodyguard to get her to the Cornerstone of Light. During this time, Minnie shows powers as a sorceress of white magic, casting a holy light on the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Heartless]] that attack.

She and [[Mickey Mouse]] were first drawn by Iwerks in 1928. The [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] story \"The Gleam\" (published January 19 \u2013 May 2, 1942) by [[Merrill De Maris]] and [[Floyd Gottfredson]] first gave her full name as '''Minerva Mouse''', although this is seldom used.\n\nThe comic strip story \"Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers\" (published September 22 \u2013 December 26, 1930) introduced her father Marcus Mouse and her unnamed mother, both farmers. The same story featured photographs of Minnie's uncle Milton Mouse with his family and her grandparents Marvel Mouse and Matilda Mouse. Her best-known relatives, however, remain her uncle Mortimer Mouse (Mortimer was almost the name of Mickey) and her twin nieces, Millie and Melody Mouse, though most often a single niece, Melody, appears. In many appearances, Minnie is presented as the girlfriend of Mickey Mouse, a close friend of [[Daisy Duck]],<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/2000/minnievisitsdaisy.html Minnie Visits Daisy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224023232/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/2000/minnievisitsdaisy.html |date=2008-02-24 }}.

Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched [[knickers]].  In the 1929 cartoon ''[[The Karnival Kid]]'', it was also revealed that she wears black [[stockings]] which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her [[shoes]] are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled [[court shoe|pumps]] that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of her shoes, and she even loses her shoes completely in ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''. When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with the rhythm of the music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow, and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, her look and personality became more [[conservative]].  Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).\n\nMinnie's early personality is cute, playful, musical and flirtatious. She often portrays an entertainer like a dancer or a musician whose affection Mickey is trying to win.  Part of the comedy of these early shorts is the varying degree of success Mickey has in wooing Minnie.  Unlike later cartoons after the redesign, Minnie often becomes a [[damsel in distress]] whom Mickey tries to rescue.  She is also subject to a lot of [[slapstick]] and [[rubber hose animation]] gags.  Over the course of the 1930s, Minnie's and Mickey's relationship solidified and they eventually became a steady couple.\n\nMinnie was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short ''[[Plane Crazy]]''.<ref name=\"disneyshorts.org Plane Crazy\"/> Minnie is invited to join Mickey in the first flight of his aircraft. She accepts the invitation but not his request for a kiss in mid-flight. Mickey eventually forces Minnie into a kiss but this only results in her parachuting out of the plane. This first film depicted Minnie as somewhat resistant to the demanding affection of her potential boyfriend and capable of escaping his grasp.\n\nTheir debut, however, featured the couple already familiar to each other. The next film featuring them was ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''.<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1928/gallopingaucho.html Gallopin' Gaucho] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218232735/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1928/gallopingaucho.html |date=2008-02-18 }}.

Retrieved on March 17, 2008.</ref> The film was the second of their series to be produced, but the third to be released, and was released on December 30, 1928. We find Minnie employed at the ''Cantina Argentina'', a bar and restaurant established in the [[Pampas]] of [[Argentina]]. She performs the [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] for Mickey the [[gaucho]] and [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] the outlaw. Both flirt with her but the latter intends to abduct her while the former obliges in saving the [[Damsel in distress|Damsel in Distress]] from the [[villain]]. All three characters acted as strangers first being introduced to each other.\n\nBut it was their third cartoon that established the definitive early look and personality of both Mickey and Minnie, as well as Pete. ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'',<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1928/steamboatwillie.html Steamboat Willie]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327040614/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1928/steamboatwillie.html |date=2008-03-27 }}.

The two [[anthropomorphic]] mice first star in a [[sound film]] and spend most of its duration playing music to the tune of \"[[Turkey in the Straw]]\".\n\n===Minnie's Yoo-Hoo===\nHer next appearance was arguably more significant. ''Mickey's Follies'' (June 26, 1929),<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1929/mickeysfollies.html Mickey's Follies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114072127/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1929/mickeysfollies.html |date=2011-01-14 }}.

Mickey then proceeds to explain his reaction to Minnie's call. The song firmly establishes Mickey and Minnie as a couple and expresses the importance Minnie holds for her male partner.\n\n===Damsel in distress===\nHer final appearance for the year was in ''[[Wild Waves]],''<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/wildwaves.html Wild Waves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704133940/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/wildwaves.html |date=2008-07-04 }}.

Mickey uses a row boat to rescue her and return her to the shore but Minnie is still visibly shaken from the experience. Mickey starts singing the tune of \"Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep\", a maritime ballad, in an apparent effort to cheer her up. Minnie cheers up and the short ends. This is the second time Minnie is placed in danger and then saved by her new boyfriend. It would not be the last.\n\nIn fact, this was the case with her next appearance in ''[[The Cactus Kid (1930 film)|The Cactus Kid]]'' (May 10, 1930).<ref name=ultimate>{{cite book |last1=Kaufman |first1=J.B. |last2=Gerstein |first2=David |title=Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: The Ultimate History |date=2018 |publisher=Taschen |location=Cologne |isbn=978-3-8365-5284-4}}</ref> As the title implies the short was intended as a [[Western movie]] parody, but it is considered to be more or less a remake of ''The Gallopin' Gaucho'' set in [[Mexico]] instead of [[Argentina]]. Minnie was again cast as the local tavern dancer who is abducted by Peg-Leg Pedro ([[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] in his first appearance with a peg-leg). Mickey again comes to the rescue. The short is considered significant for being the last short featuring Mickey and Minnie to be animated by [[Ub Iwerks]].\n\n''[[The Shindig]]'' (July 11, 1930)<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/shindig.html The Shindig] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317184932/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/shindig.html |date=2008-03-17 }}.

This was arguably the first time Minnie was upstaged by a female co-star.\n\nIn ''[[The Fire Fighters (1930 film)|The Fire Fighters]]'' (June 20, 1930), Minnie is trapped in a hotel during a fire.<ref name=ultimate/> She spends the duration of the short in mortal peril but is rescued by firefighters under Chief Mickey Mouse. Horace Horsecollar is among the firefighters. An unnamed cow in the background is possibly Clarabelle making a cameo. The music of the short was, appropriately, the tune of \"[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]]\".\n\nThe next entry in the series is considered curious: ''[[The Gorilla Mystery]]'' (October 1, 1930).<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/gorillamystery.html The Gorilla Mystery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426215215/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/gorillamystery.html |date=2008-04-26 }}.

He phones Minnie to warn her about the dangerous gorilla wandering about. Minnie is unconcerned and plays tunes on her piano for Mickey to hear over the phone and know she is not afraid. Her tunes are interrupted by her scream and Mickey rushes to her house to save her. Meanwhile, Beppo has wrapped up Minnie in rope and holds her hostage. Mickey confronts the gorilla and once again rescues the damsel in distress.\n\n===Introduction of a pet===\nIn ''[[The Picnic (1930 film)|The Picnic]]'' (1930), Minnie introduces her boyfriend to her new pet dog, Rover. This is actually [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] making his first appearance as an individual character. Two unnamed bloodhound guard dogs strikingly similar to him had previously appeared in ''[[The Chain Gang]]'' (August 18, 1930)<ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/chaingang.html The Chain Gang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410221545/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1930/chaingang.html |date=2008-04-10 }}.

Otherwise the short features a typical picnic excursion harassed by forest animals and brought to a premature end by a sudden rain.\n\nThe final appearance of Minnie during the year was ''[[Pioneer Days (1930 film)|Pioneer Days]]'' (November 20, 1930).<ref name=ultimate />{{rp|63}} The short featured Minnie and her mate as pioneer settlers heading to the [[American Old West]] driving a [[Conestoga wagon|covered wagon]] in a [[wagon train]]. They are unsurprisingly attacked by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on their way, a stock plot of [[Western movie]]s at the time. While their fellows are either subjected to [[scalping]] or running for their lives, Minnie is captured by the attackers. Mickey attempts to rescue her only to be captured himself. In a reversal of their usual roles, Minnie escapes her captors and rescues her mate. They then dress as soldiers of the [[United States Army]]. Their mere appearance proves sufficient to have the entire tribe running for the hills. The Mouse couple stands triumphant at the end. The short has been criticized for its unflattering depiction of Native Americans as rather bestial predators. The finale has been edited out in recent viewings for depicting the \"braves\" submitting to cowardice.\n\nIn several shorts, comics and TV shows, Minnie owns a black and white kitten named [[Figaro (Disney)|Figaro]], who had originated in the Disney animated feature ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n\n===Waning years===\nDuring the second half of the thirties, Minnie did not appear as often in Mickey cartoons. This was mainly due to the growth in popularity of Mickey's new sidekicks, [[Goofy]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], whose appearances in Mickey cartoons had more or less replaced Minnie's role. Minnie's appearances in Mickey cartoons thus became less numerous, but she did have a few major roles in some Pluto and [[Figaro (Disney)|Figaro]] cartoons during the 1940s. Minnie made a sort of comeback in the 1980s when she was re-introduced in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' and then got her own starring role in ''[[Totally Minnie]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Charles|last=Solomon |title= Television Reviews 'Disney's Totally Minnie': Live Action, Animation |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 25, 1988|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-25/entertainment/ca-249_1_minnie-mouse|accessdate=2011-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary appearances===\n*She starred in a 1988 musical television special on NBC called ''[[Totally Minnie]]'' and it was the first film to feature Minnie in a lead role.

She, at the suggestion of a letter left by the missing King, sends [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]] on their mission to find Mickey and the Keyblade Master, [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]]. During ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', when Pete's tampering of the past causes the Heartless to appear in Disney Castle, Minnie is forced to fall back to the library until Sora and company arrive. While Donald and Goofy head to get the other residents to safety, Sora serves as the Queen's bodyguard to get her to the Cornerstone of Light. During this time, Minnie shows powers as a sorceress of white magic, casting a holy light on the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobodies|Heartless]] that attack. In the prequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', she oversees the annually held Dream Festival in Disney Town, where Pete causes mischief until she banishes him to another dimension as punishment. She appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'' in a role mirroring that in the film ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', where she is referred to as Princess Minnie and rules a world called the Country of the Musketeers. By this, it is inferred that she, not Mickey, is the rightful ruler of Disney Castle, which is why he leaves her in charge.

For this particular film, Minnie is drawn with bangs, which do not appear in any later cartoons.\n\n==Voice==\nMinnie was first voiced by [[Walt Disney]], who was also the original voice of Mickey Mouse.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Marjorie Ralston, a Disney inker who joined the animation team as Disney's thirteenth employee, voiced her in the 1929 short ''Wild Waves'', but did not further pursue the role out of shyness. Then, from 1930 until 1939, Minnie was voiced by [[Marcellite Garner]]. Then from 1941 to 1942, and on the radio program, ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]'', she was voiced by [[Thelma Boardman]]. Following this, from 1942 to 1952 [[Ruth Clifford]] provided the character's voice. [[Janet Waldo]] voiced Minnie in the 1974 Disneyland record album, ''An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players''.<ref name=\"cartoonresearch.com\"/> Minnie would go without any spoken dialogue until 1986, when [[Russi Taylor]] inherited the role, which she performed until her death in 2019 (her husband, [[Wayne Allwine]], voiced Mickey from 1977 until his death in 2009), with a new voice actress to be announced later on.\n\n==Appearances in cartoon shorts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928)\n*''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'' (1928)\n*''[[The Barn Dance]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Plane Crazy]]'' (1929)\n*''[[When the Cat's Away (1929 film)|When the Cat's Away]]'' (1929)\n*''[[The Plowboy]]'' (1929)\n*''[[The Karnival Kid]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Mickey's Follies]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Mickey's Choo-Choo]]'' (1929)\n*''Wild Waves'' (1929)\n*''[[The Cactus Kid (1930 film)|The Cactus Kid]]'' (1930)\n*''The Fire Fighters'' (1930)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse (film series)#ep20|The Shindig]]'' (1930)\n*''[[The Gorilla Mystery]]'' (1930)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse (film series)#ep23|The Picnic]]'' (1930)\n*''Pioneer Days'' (1930)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse (film series)#ep25|The Birthday Party]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Traffic Troubles]]'' (1931)\n*''[[The Delivery Boy (1931 film)|The Delivery Boy]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Mickey Steps Out]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Blue Rhythm]]'' (1931)\n*''[[The Barnyard Broadcast]]'' (1931)\n*''[[The Beach Party]]'' (1931)\n{{col-break}}\n*''[[Mickey Cuts Up]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Mickey's Orphans]]'' (1931)\n*''[[The Grocery Boy]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Barnyard Olympics]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Musical Farmer]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Mickey in Arabia]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Mickey's Nightmare]]'' (1932)\n*''[[The Whoopee Party]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Touchdown Mickey]]'' (1932)\n*''[[The Wayward Canary]]'' (1932)\n*''[[The Klondike Kid]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Building a Building]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Mickey's Pal Pluto]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Mickey's Mellerdrammer]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Ye Olden Days]]'' (1933)\n*''[[The Mail Pilot]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Mickey's Mechanical Man]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Mickey's Gala Premier]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Puppy Love]]'' (1933)\n*''[[The Steeplechase]]'' (1933)\n*''[[The Pet Store]]'' (1933)\n*''[[Shanghaied (1934 film)|Shanghaied]]'' (1934)\n{{col-break}}\n*''[[List of Mickey Mouse cartoons#1934|Camping Out]]'' (1934)\n*''[[Mickey's Steamroller]]'' (1934)\n*''[[Two-Gun Mickey]]'' (1934)\n*''[[On Ice (film)|On Ice]]'' (1935)\n*''[[Mickey's Rival]]'' (1936)\n*''[[Hawaiian Holiday]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Boat Builders]]'' (1938)\n*''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'' (1938)\n*''[[The Fox Hunt (1938 film)|The Fox Hunt]]'' (1938, cameo)\n*''[[Mickey's Surprise Party]]'' (1939, in a commercial short)\n*''[[The Little Whirlwind]]'' (1941)\n*''[[The Nifty Nineties]]'' (1941)\n*''[[Mickey's Birthday Party]]'' (1942)\n*''Out of the Frying Pan into the Firing Line'' (1942, in a Pluto short)\n*''First Aiders'' (1944, in a Pluto short)\n*''Bath Day'' (1946, in a Figaro short)\n*''Figaro and Frankie'' (1947, in a Figaro short)\n*''[[Mickey's Delayed Date]]'' (1947)\n*''Pluto's Sweater'' (1949, in a Pluto short)\n*''Pluto and the Gopher'' (1950, in a Pluto short)\n*''[[Crazy Over Daisy]]'' (1950, cameo in a Donald Duck short)\n*''[[Pluto's Christmas Tree]]'' (1952)\n*''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983, non-speaking appearance)\n*''[[Runaway Brain]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Get a Horse!]]'' (2013)\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Television appearances===\n*''[[Walt Disney anthology television series]]'' (1954\u20132008)\n**''[[Totally Minnie]]'' (1988)\n**''[[Mickey's 60th Birthday]]'' (1988)\n*''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' (1955\u20131959; 1977\u20131979; 1989\u20131994)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (1999\u20132000)\n*''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016)\n**''[[Minnie's Bow-Toons]]'' (2011\u20132016)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present)\n*''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]'' (2017\u2013present)\n*''[[Mickey's 90th Spectacular]]'' (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{portal|Animation|Comics|Film|Disney}}\n* {{Inducks character|MI}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170725075747/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000681/ Minnie Mouse] on [[IMDb]]\n\n{{Disney Characters}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic mice and rats]]\n[[Category:Disney comics characters]]\n[[Category:Disney core universe characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Calisota]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1928]]\n[[Category:Fictional mice and rats]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n", "name_user": "Woodlot", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Mouse"}

The human range is commonly given as 20 to 20,000&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], although there is considerable variation between individuals, especially at high frequencies, and a gradual loss of sensitivity to higher frequencies with age is considered normal. Sensitivity also varies with frequency, as shown by [[equal-loudness contour]]s. Routine investigation for hearing loss usually involves an [[audiogram]] which shows threshold levels relative to a normal.\n\nSeveral animal species are able to hear frequencies well beyond the human hearing range. Some dolphins and bats, for example, can hear frequencies up to 100,000&nbsp;Hz.  Elephants can hear sounds at 14\u201316&nbsp;Hz, while some whales can hear infrasonic sounds as low as 7&nbsp;Hz (in water).\n\n==Measurement==\nA basic measure of hearing is afforded by an audiogram, a graph of the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] (minimum discernible sound level) at various frequencies throughout an organism's nominal hearing range.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marler|first=Peter|title=Nature's Music: The Science of Birdsong|date=2004|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0124730700|page=207}}</ref>\n\nBehavioural hearing tests or physiological tests can be used to find hearing thresholds of humans and other animals. For humans, the test involves tones being presented at specific frequencies ([[Pitch (music)|pitch]]) and intensities ([[loudness]]). When the subject hears the sound, he or she indicates it by raising a hand or pressing a button. The lowest intensity they can hear is recorded. The test varies for children; their response to the sound can be indicated by a turn of the head or using a toy. The child learns what to do upon hearing the sound, such as placing a toy man in a boat. A similar technique can be used when testing animals, where food is used as a reward for responding to the sound. The information on different mammals hearing was obtained primarily by behavioural hearing tests.\n\nPhysiological tests do not need the patient to consciously respond.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Jack|title=Handbook of Clinical Audiology|year=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683307658|edition=5th}}</ref>\n\n==Humans==\n{{see also|Auditory system}}\nIn humans, [[sound waves]] funnel into the ear via the [[external ear canal]] and reach the [[eardrum]] (tympanic membrane). The [[compression (physical)|compression]] and [[rarefaction]] of these waves set this thin membrane in motion, causing sympathetic vibration through the middle ear bones (the [[ossicles]]: malleus, incus, and stapes), the basilar fluid in the cochlea, and the hairs within it, called [[Stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]].  These hairs line the cochlea from base to apex, and the part stimulated and the intensity of stimulation gives an indication of the nature of the sound. Information gathered from the hair cells is sent via the auditory nerve for processing in the brain.\n\nThe commonly stated range of human hearing is 20 to 20,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stuart|title=Signals and Systems for Speech and Hearing|date=2011|publisher=BRILL|page=163|edition=2nd|quote=For auditory signals and human listeners, the accepted range is 20Hz to 20kHz, the limits of human hearing}}</ref><ref name=springer>{{cite book|last=Rossing|first=Thomas|title=Springer Handbook of Acoustics|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0387304465|pages=747, 748}}</ref><ref group=note>which corresponds to sound waves in air at 20\u00b0C with [[wavelength]]s of 17 meters to 1.7 cm (56 ft to 0.7 inch).</ref> Under ideal laboratory conditions, humans can hear sound as low as 12&nbsp;Hz<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC | title = Music, Physics and Engineering | last = Olson | first = Harry F. | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1967 | isbn = 0-486-21769-8 | page = 249 | quote = Under very favorable conditions most individuals can obtain tonal characteristics as low as 12 cycles. | authorlink = Harry F.

When dogs hear a sound, they will move their ears towards it in order to maximize reception. In order to achieve this, the ears of a dog are controlled by at least 18 muscles, which allow the ears to tilt and rotate. The ear's shape also allows the sound to be heard more accurately. Many breeds often have upright and curved ears, which direct and amplify sounds.\n\nAs dogs hear higher frequency sounds than humans, they have a different acoustic perception of the world.<ref name=\"University of Nebraska\" /> Sounds that seem loud to humans often emit high-frequency tones that can scare away dogs.  [[Whistle]]s which emit ultrasonic sound, called [[dog whistle]]s,  are used in dog training, as a dog will respond much better to such levels. In the wild, dogs use their hearing capabilities to hunt and locate food. Domestic breeds are often used to guard property due to their increased hearing ability.<ref name=\"Physics Factbook\" /> So-called \"Nelson\" [[dog whistle]]s generate sounds at frequencies higher than those audible to humans but well within the range of a dog's hearing.\n\n==Bats==\n[[Bat]]s have evolved very sensitive hearing to cope with their nocturnal activity. Their hearing range varies by species; at the lowest it can be 1&nbsp;kHz for some species and for other species the highest reaches up to 200&nbsp;kHz.

A bat will produce a very loud, short sound and assess the echo when it bounces back. Bats hunt flying insects; these insects return a faint echo of the bat's call. The type of insect, how big it is and distance can be determined by the quality of the echo and time it takes for the echo to rebound. There are two types of call [[Doppler Shift Compensation|constant frequency]] (CF), and [[frequency modulated]] (FM) that descend in pitch.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://research.amnh.org/users/nyneve/bats.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921195646/http://research.amnh.org/users/nyneve/bats.html | archivedate = 2007-09-21 | title = The Night is Alive With the Sound of Echoes | first = Devorah A.

The pulses of sound produced by the bat last only a few thousandths of a second; silences between the calls give time to listen for the information coming back in the form of an echo. Evidence suggests that bats use the change in pitch of sound produced via the [[Doppler effect]] to assess their flight speed in relation to objects around them.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fathom.com/course/21701775/session3.html | title =  The Secret Life of Bats | first = Phil | last = Richardson | accessdate = 2012-02-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608134519/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701775/session3.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref> The information regarding size, shape and texture is built up to form a picture of their surroundings and the location of their prey. Using these factors a bat can successfully track change in movements and therefore hunt down their prey.\n\n==Mice==\n[[Mice]] have large ears in comparison to their bodies. They hear higher frequencies than humans; their frequency range is 1&nbsp;kHz to 70&nbsp;kHz. They do not hear the lower frequencies that humans can; they communicate using high-frequency noises some of which are inaudible by humans. The distress call of a young mouse can be produced at 40&nbsp;kHz. The mice use their ability to produce sounds out of predators' frequency ranges to alert other mice of danger without exposing themselves, though notably, cats' hearing range encompasses the mouse's entire vocal range. The squeaks that humans can hear are lower in frequency and are used by the mouse to make longer distance calls, as low-frequency sounds can travel farther than high-frequency sounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/hia/vol8/lawlor.html |title=A Home For A Mouse |first=Monika |last=Lawlor |journal=Society & Animals |volume=8 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013171659/http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/hia/vol8/lawlor.html |archivedate=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Birds==\nHearing is birds' second most important sense and their ears are funnel-shaped to focus sound. The ears are located slightly behind and below the eyes, and they are covered with soft feathers \u2013 the auriculars \u2013 for protection. The shape of a bird's head can also affect its hearing, such as owls, whose facial discs help direct sound toward their ears.\n\nThe hearing range of birds is most sensitive between 1&nbsp;kHz and 4&nbsp;kHz, but their full range is roughly similar to human hearing, with higher or lower limits depending on the bird species. No kind of bird has been observed to react to ultrasonic sounds, but certain kinds of birds can hear infrasonic sounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=icwdm_usdanwrc | title = What Can Birds Hear? | first = Robert | last = Beason, C. | journal = USDA National Wildlife Research Center - Staff Publications | accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref> \"Birds are especially sensitive to pitch, tone and rhythm changes and use those variations to recognize other individual birds, even in a noisy flock.

[[Goldfish]] and [[catfish]] do possess a [[Weberian apparatus]] and have a wider hearing range than the [[tuna]].\n\n==Marine mammals==\n[[File:PacificWhiteSidedDolphine.jpg|thumb|right|Dolphins]]\n\nAs aquatic environments have very different physical properties than land environments, there are differences in how marine mammals hear compared with land mammals. The differences in [[auditory system]]s have led to extensive research on aquatic mammals, specifically on dolphins.\n\nResearchers customarily divide marine mammals into five hearing groups based on their range of best underwater hearing. (Ketten, 1998): Low-frequency baleen whales like blue whales (7 Hz to 35 kHz); Mid-frequency toothed whales like most dolphins and sperm whales (150 Hz to 160 kHz) ; High-frequency toothed whales like some dolphins and porpoises (275 Hz to 160 kHz); Seals (50 Hz to 86 kHz); Fur seals and sea lions (60 Hz to 39 kHz).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iogp.org/seismic-surveys-and-marine-mammals-2018/|title=Seismic Surveys & Marine Mammals|website=www.iogp.org|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe auditory system of a land mammal typically works via the transfer of sound waves through the ear canals. Ear canals in [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lions]], and [[walruses]] are similar to those of land mammals and may function the same way. In whales and dolphins, it is not entirely clear how sound is propagated to the ear, but some studies strongly suggest that sound is channelled to the ear by tissues in the area of the lower jaw. One group of whales, the [[Odontocetes]] (toothed whales), use echolocation to determine the position of objects such as prey. The toothed whales are also unusual in that the ears are separated from the skull and placed well apart, which assists them with localizing sounds, an important element for echolocation. \n\nStudies<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.whoi.edu/csi/images/Ketten_Wartzok_1990.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100730122029/http://www.whoi.edu/csi/images/Ketten_Wartzok_1990.pdf | archivedate = 2010-07-30 | title = Three-Dimensional Reconstructions of the Dolphin Ear | first1 = D.

Type I has been found in the [[Amazon river dolphin]] and [[harbour porpoise]]s. These types of dolphin use extremely high frequency signals for echolocation. Harbour porpoises emit sounds at  two bands, one at 2&nbsp;kHz and one above 110&nbsp;kHz. The cochlea in these dolphins is specialised to accommodate extreme high frequency sounds and is extremely narrow at the base.\n\nType II cochlea are found primarily in offshore and open water species of whales, such as the [[bottlenose dolphin]]. The sounds produced by bottlenose dolphins are lower in frequency and range typically between 75 and 150,000&nbsp;Hz. The higher frequencies in this range are also used for echolocation and the lower frequencies are commonly associated with social interaction as the signals travel much farther distances.\n\nMarine mammals use vocalisations in many different ways. Dolphins communicate via clicks and whistles, and whales use low-frequency moans or pulse signals. Each signal varies in terms of frequency and different signals are used to communicate different aspects. In dolphins, echolocation is used in order to detect and characterize objects and whistles are used in sociable herds as identification and communication devices.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Audiology]]\n* [[Audiometry]]\n* [[The Mosquito]]\n* [[Seismic communication]]\n* [[Minimum audibility curve]]\n* [[Musical acoustics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Works cited==\n* {{cite web|last=D'Ambrose|first=Chris|year=2003|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|accessdate=2007-02-28|work=The Physics Factbook}}\n*  {{cite book|editor-last=Hoelzel|editor-first=A.

The human range is commonly given as 20 to 20,000&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]], although there is considerable variation between individuals, especially at high frequencies, and a gradual loss of sensitivity to higher frequencies with age is considered normal. Sensitivity also varies with frequency, as shown by [[equal-loudness contour]]s. Routine investigation for hearing loss usually involves an [[audiogram]] which shows threshold levels relative to a normal.\n\nSeveral animal species are able to hear frequencies well beyond the human hearing range. Some dolphins and bats, for example, can hear frequencies up to 100,000&nbsp;Hz.  Elephants can hear sounds at 14\u201316&nbsp;Hz, while some whales can hear infrasonic sounds as low as 7&nbsp;Hz (in water).\n\n==Measurement==\nA basic measure of hearing is afforded by an audiogram, a graph of the [[absolute threshold of hearing]] (minimum discernible sound level) at various frequencies throughout an organism's nominal hearing range.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marler|first=Peter|title=Nature's Music: The Science of Birdsong|date=2004|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0124730700|page=207}}</ref>\n\nBehavioural hearing tests or physiological tests can be used to find hearing thresholds of humans and other animals. For humans, the test involves tones being presented at specific frequencies ([[Pitch (music)|pitch]]) and intensities ([[loudness]]). When the subject hears the sound, he or she indicates it by raising a hand or pressing a button. The lowest intensity they can hear is recorded. The test varies for children; their response to the sound can be indicated by a turn of the head or using a toy. The child learns what to do upon hearing the sound, such as placing a toy man in a boat. A similar technique can be used when testing animals, where food is used as a reward for responding to the sound. The information on different mammals hearing was obtained primarily by behavioural hearing tests.\n\nPhysiological tests do not need the patient to consciously respond.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Jack|title=Handbook of Clinical Audiology|year=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683307658|edition=5th}}</ref>\n\n==Humans==\n{{see also|Auditory system}}\nIn humans, [[sound waves]] funnel into the ear via the [[external ear canal]] and reach the [[eardrum]] (tympanic membrane). The [[compression (physical)|compression]] and [[rarefaction]] of these waves set this thin membrane in motion, causing sympathetic vibration through the middle ear bones (the [[ossicles]]: malleus, incus, and stapes), the basilar fluid in the cochlea, and the hairs within it, called [[Stereocilia (inner ear)|stereocilia]].  These hairs line the cochlea from base to apex, and the part stimulated and the intensity of stimulation gives an indication of the nature of the sound. Information gathered from the hair cells is sent via the auditory nerve for processing in the brain.\n\nThe commonly stated range of human hearing is 20 to 20,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stuart|title=Signals and Systems for Speech and Hearing|date=2011|publisher=BRILL|page=163|edition=2nd|quote=For auditory signals and human listeners, the accepted range is 20Hz to 20kHz, the limits of human hearing}}</ref><ref name=springer>{{cite book|last=Rossing|first=Thomas|title=Springer Handbook of Acoustics|date=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0387304465|pages=747, 748}}</ref><ref group=note>which corresponds to sound waves in air at 20\u00b0C with [[wavelength]]s of 17 meters to 1.7 cm (56 ft to 0.7 inch).</ref> Under ideal laboratory conditions, humans can hear sound as low as 12&nbsp;Hz<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC | title = Music, Physics and Engineering | last = Olson | first = Harry F. | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1967 | isbn = 0-486-21769-8 | page = 249 | quote = Under very favorable conditions most individuals can obtain tonal characteristics as low as 12 cycles. | authorlink = Harry F.

When dogs hear a sound, they will move their ears towards it in order to maximize reception. In order to achieve this, the ears of a dog are controlled by at least 18 muscles, which allow the ears to tilt and rotate. The ear's shape also allows the sound to be heard more accurately. Many breeds often have upright and curved ears, which direct and amplify sounds.\n\nAs dogs hear higher frequency sounds than humans, they have a different acoustic perception of the world.<ref name=\"University of Nebraska\" /> Sounds that seem loud to humans often emit high-frequency tones that can scare away dogs.  [[Whistle]]s which emit ultrasonic sound, called [[dog whistle]]s,  are used in dog training, as a dog will respond much better to such levels. In the wild, dogs use their hearing capabilities to hunt and locate food.

There are two types of call [[Doppler Shift Compensation|constant frequency]] (CF), and [[frequency modulated]] (FM) that descend in pitch.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://research.amnh.org/users/nyneve/bats.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921195646/http://research.amnh.org/users/nyneve/bats.html | archivedate = 2007-09-21 | title = The Night is Alive With the Sound of Echoes | first = Devorah A. N.|last= Bennu | date =2001-10-10 | accessdate = 2012-02-04}}</ref> Each type reveals different information; CF is used to detect an object, and FM is used to assess its distance. The pulses of sound produced by the bat last only a few thousandths of a second; silences between the calls give time to listen for the information coming back in the form of an echo. Evidence suggests that bats use the change in pitch of sound produced via the [[Doppler effect]] to assess their flight speed in relation to objects around them.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fathom.com/course/21701775/session3.html | title =  The Secret Life of Bats | first = Phil | last = Richardson | accessdate = 2012-02-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608134519/http://www.fathom.com/course/21701775/session3.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref> The information regarding size, shape and texture is built up to form a picture of their surroundings and the location of their prey. Using these factors a bat can successfully track change in movements and therefore hunt down their prey.\n\n==Mice==\n[[Mice]] have large ears in comparison to their bodies. They hear higher frequencies than humans; their frequency range is 1&nbsp;kHz to 70&nbsp;kHz. They do not hear the lower frequencies that humans can; they communicate using high-frequency noises some of which are inaudible by humans. The distress call of a young mouse can be produced at 40&nbsp;kHz. The mice use their ability to produce sounds out of predators' frequency ranges to alert other mice of danger without exposing themselves, though notably, cats' hearing range encompasses the mouse's entire vocal range. The squeaks that humans can hear are lower in frequency and are used by the mouse to make longer distance calls, as low-frequency sounds can travel farther than high-frequency sounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/hia/vol8/lawlor.html |title=A Home For A Mouse |first=Monika |last=Lawlor |journal=Society & Animals |volume=8 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013171659/http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/hia/vol8/lawlor.html |archivedate=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Birds==\nHearing is birds' second most important sense and their ears are funnel-shaped to focus sound. The ears are located slightly behind and below the eyes, and they are covered with soft feathers \u2013 the auriculars \u2013 for protection. The shape of a bird's head can also affect its hearing, such as owls, whose facial discs help direct sound toward their ears.\n\nThe hearing range of birds is most sensitive between 1&nbsp;kHz and 4&nbsp;kHz, but their full range is roughly similar to human hearing, with higher or lower limits depending on the bird species. No kind of bird has been observed to react to ultrasonic sounds, but certain kinds of birds can hear infrasonic sounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=icwdm_usdanwrc | title = What Can Birds Hear? | first = Robert | last = Beason, C. | journal = USDA National Wildlife Research Center - Staff Publications | accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref> \"Birds are especially sensitive to pitch, tone and rhythm changes and use those variations to recognize other individual birds, even in a noisy flock.

These birds live in caves and use their rapid chirps and clicks to navigate through dark caves where even sensitive vision may not be useful enough.\"<ref name=Birding/>\n\n==Fish==\n{{unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nFish have a narrow hearing range compared to most mammals. [[Goldfish]] and [[catfish]] do possess a [[Weberian apparatus]] and have a wider hearing range than the [[tuna]].\n\n==Marine mammals==\n[[File:PacificWhiteSidedDolphine.jpg|thumb|right|Dolphins]]\n\nAs aquatic environments have very different physical properties than land environments, there are differences in how marine mammals hear compared with land mammals. The differences in [[auditory system]]s have led to extensive research on aquatic mammals, specifically on dolphins.\n\nResearchers customarily divide marine mammals into five hearing groups based on their range of best underwater hearing. (Ketten, 1998): Low-frequency baleen whales like blue whales (7 Hz to 35 kHz); Mid-frequency toothed whales like most dolphins and sperm whales (150 Hz to 160 kHz) ; High-frequency toothed whales like some dolphins and porpoises (275 Hz to 160 kHz); Seals (50 Hz to 86 kHz); Fur seals and sea lions (60 Hz to 39 kHz).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iogp.org/seismic-surveys-and-marine-mammals-2018/|title=Seismic Surveys & Marine Mammals|website=www.iogp.org|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe auditory system of a land mammal typically works via the transfer of sound waves through the ear canals. Ear canals in [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lions]], and [[walruses]] are similar to those of land mammals and may function the same way. In whales and dolphins, it is not entirely clear how sound is propagated to the ear, but some studies strongly suggest that sound is channelled to the ear by tissues in the area of the lower jaw. One group of whales, the [[Odontocetes]] (toothed whales), use echolocation to determine the position of objects such as prey. The toothed whales are also unusual in that the ears are separated from the skull and placed well apart, which assists them with localizing sounds, an important element for echolocation. \n\nStudies<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.whoi.edu/csi/images/Ketten_Wartzok_1990.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100730122029/http://www.whoi.edu/csi/images/Ketten_Wartzok_1990.pdf | archivedate = 2010-07-30 | title = Three-Dimensional Reconstructions of the Dolphin Ear | first1 = D.

Type I has been found in the [[Amazon river dolphin]] and [[harbour porpoise]]s. These types of dolphin use extremely high frequency signals for echolocation. Harbour porpoises emit sounds at  two bands, one at 2&nbsp;kHz and one above 110&nbsp;kHz. The cochlea in these dolphins is specialised to accommodate extreme high frequency sounds and is extremely narrow at the base.\n\nType II cochlea are found primarily in offshore and open water species of whales, such as the [[bottlenose dolphin]]. The sounds produced by bottlenose dolphins are lower in frequency and range typically between 75 and 150,000&nbsp;Hz. The higher frequencies in this range are also used for echolocation and the lower frequencies are commonly associated with social interaction as the signals travel much farther distances.\n\nMarine mammals use vocalisations in many different ways. Dolphins communicate via clicks and whistles, and whales use low-frequency moans or pulse signals. Each signal varies in terms of frequency and different signals are used to communicate different aspects. In dolphins, echolocation is used in order to detect and characterize objects and whistles are used in sociable herds as identification and communication devices.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Audiology]]\n* [[Audiometry]]\n* [[The Mosquito]]\n* [[Seismic communication]]\n* [[Minimum audibility curve]]\n* [[Musical acoustics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Works cited==\n* {{cite web|last=D'Ambrose|first=Chris|year=2003|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|accessdate=2007-02-28|work=The Physics Factbook}}\n*  {{cite book|editor-last=Hoelzel|editor-first=A.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

He often returned to visit Hungary, giving lectures as well as interviews in Hungarian television programs. He conducted a lecture in 1973 at the Hungarian Scientific Academy in Hungarian and observers noted that he had no accent, despite spending many years abroad. His book''The Stress of Life'' appeared in Hungarian as ''Az \u00c9let\u00fcnk \u00e9s a stressz'' in 1964 and became a bestseller. [[Selye J\u00e1nos University]], the only [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] [[university]] in [[Slovakia]], was named after him.

After completing his medical degree and a doctorate degree in organic chemistry at the German University of Prague, he received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and later moved to the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University in Montreal where he studied under the sponsorship of James Bertram Collip.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jackson|first=Mark|title=Evaluating the Role of Hans Selye in the Modern History of Stress|date=2014|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349158/|work=Stress, Shock, and Adaptation in the Twentieth Century|editor-last=Cantor|editor-first=David|series=Open Access Monographs and Book Chapters Funded by Wellcome Trust|publisher=University of Rochester Press|isbn=9781580464765|pmid=26962615|access-date=2018-12-02|editor2-last=Ramsden|editor2-first=Edmund}}</ref>  While working with laboratory animals, Selye observed a phenomenon that he thought resembled what he had previously seen in chronic patients. Rats exposed to cold, drugs, or surgical injury exhibited a common pattern of responses; this \"general adaptation syndrome\" or \"Selyes syndrome\" was triphasic, involving an initial alarm phase followed by a stage of resistance or adaptation and, finally, a stage of exhaustion and death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdnmedhall.org/inductees/hansselye|title=Dr. Hans Selye {{!}} Canadian Medical Hall of Fame|website=www.cdnmedhall.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}</ref> Working with doctoral student Thomas McKeown (1912\u201388), Selye published a report that used the word \u201cstress\u201d to describe these responses to adverse events.<ref>{{Citation|last=Koops|first=Matthias|chapter=Historical Account of the Substances Which have been Used to Describe Events, and to Convey Ideas, from the Earliest Date, to the Invention of Paper|pages=7\u2013258|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511694530|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511694530.002|year=2010|hdl=2027/gri.ark:/13960/t04x8wd2g|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\nHis last inspiration for ''[[general adaptation syndrome]]'' (GAS, a theory of [[Stress (biology)|stress]]) came from an endocrinological experiment in which he injected mice with extracts of various organs. He at first believed he had discovered a new hormone, but was proved wrong when every irritating substance he injected produced the same symptoms (swelling of the [[adrenal cortex]], atrophy of the [[thymus]], gastric and duodenal ulcers).<ref>Hans Selye, \"The General Adaptation Syndrome and the Diseases of Adaptation\" (two parts), \n''Journal of Allergy'' [later ''and Clinical Immunology''] 17/4 (July 1946): 231\u2013247; and 17/6 (Nov. 1946): 358-98.\nAvailable online at https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-8707(46)90148-7\nand (conclusion) https://www.jacionline.org/article/0021-8707(46)90159-1/pdf</ref> This, paired with his observation that people with different diseases exhibit similar symptoms, led to his description of the effects of \"noxious agents\" as he at first called it. He later coined the term \"[[Stress (biology)|stress]]\", which has been accepted into the lexicon of most other languages.<ref>Selye, Hans (1956). ''The Stress of Life''. New York: McGraw-Hill.

Online at\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/285410</ref>\n\nSelye has acknowledged the influence of [[Claude Bernard]] (who developed the idea of ''[[milieu int\u00e9rieur]]'') and [[Walter Cannon]]'s \"[[homeostasis]]\". Selye conceptualized the physiology of stress as having two components: a set of responses which he called the \"[[general adaptation syndrome]]\", and the development of a pathological state from ongoing, unrelieved stress.\n\nSelye discovered and documented that stress differs from other physical responses in that stress is stressful whether one receives good or bad news, whether the impulse is positive or negative. He called negative stress \"[[Distress (medicine)|distress]]\" and positive stress \"[[eustress]]\". The system whereby the body copes with stress, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) system, was also first described by Selye. He also pointed to an \"alarm state\", a \"resistance state\", and an \"exhaustion state\", largely referring to glandular states. Later he developed the idea of two \"reservoirs\" of stress resistance, or alternatively stress energy.\n\nSelye wrote ''The Stress of Life'' (1956), ''From Dream to Discovery: On Being a Scientist'' (1964) and ''Stress without Distress'' (1974). He worked as a professor and director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]]. In 1975 he created the International Institute of Stress, and in 1979, Dr. Selye and Arthur Antille started the Hans Selye Foundation. Later Selye and eight Nobel laureates founded the Canadian Institute of Stress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stresscanada.org |title=Welcome To The Canadian Institute Of Stress |publisher=Stresscanada.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 he was made a [[Companion of the Order of Canada]].

Later, New York attorney Edwin Jacob contacted Selye as he prepared a defense against liability actions brought against tobacco companies. The companies wanted Selye's help in arguing that the recognized correlation between smoking and cancer was not proof of causality. The firm offered to pay Selye $1000 to make a statement supporting this claim. He agreed but refused to testify. Tobacco industry lawyers reported that Selye was willing to incorporate industry advice when writing about smoking and stress. One lawyer advised him to \"comment on the unlikelihood of there being a mechanism by which smoking could cause cardiovascular disease\u201d and to emphasize the \u201cstressful\u201d effect that anti-smoking messages had on the US population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petticrew|first=Mark P.|last2=Lee|first2=Kelley|date=March 2011|title=The \"Father of Stress\" Meets \"Big Tobacco\": Hans Selye and the Tobacco Industry|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=3|pages=411\u2013418|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2009.177634|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3036703|pmid=20466961}}</ref>\n\nPublicly, Selye never declared his consultancy work for the tobacco industry.

However, I do not use \u2026 cigarettes so let these examples suffice.\u201d In June 1969, Selye (then director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology, University of Montreal) testified before the Canadian House of Commons Health Committee against anti-smoking legislation, opposing advertising restrictions, health warnings, and restrictions on tar and nicotine. For his testimony Selye was funded $50 000 per year for a 3-year \u201cspecial project,\u201d  by CTR executive William Hoyt with another $50,000 a year pledged by the Canadian tobacco industry. His comments on smoking were used worldwide, Philip Morris (Tobacco company) used Selye's statements on the benefits of smoking to argue against the use of health warnings on tobacco products in Sweden.

He often returned to visit Hungary, giving lectures as well as interviews in Hungarian television programs. He conducted a lecture in 1973 at the Hungarian Scientific Academy in Hungarian and observers noted that he had no accent, despite spending many years abroad. His book''The Stress of Life'' appeared in Hungarian as ''Az \u00c9let\u00fcnk \u00e9s a stressz'' in 1964 and became a bestseller.

After completing his medical degree and a doctorate degree in organic chemistry at the German University of Prague, he received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and later moved to the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University in Montreal where he studied under the sponsorship of James Bertram Collip.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jackson|first=Mark|title=Evaluating the Role of Hans Selye in the Modern History of Stress|date=2014|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349158/|work=Stress, Shock, and Adaptation in the Twentieth Century|editor-last=Cantor|editor-first=David|series=Open Access Monographs and Book Chapters Funded by Wellcome Trust|publisher=University of Rochester Press|isbn=9781580464765|pmid=26962615|access-date=2018-12-02|editor2-last=Ramsden|editor2-first=Edmund}}</ref>  While working with laboratory animals, Selye observed a phenomenon that he thought resembled what he had previously seen in chronic patients. Rats exposed to cold, drugs, or surgical injury exhibited a common pattern of responses; this \"general adaptation syndrome\" or \"Selyes syndrome\" was triphasic, involving an initial alarm phase followed by a stage of resistance or adaptation and, finally, a stage of exhaustion and death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdnmedhall.org/inductees/hansselye|title=Dr. Hans Selye {{!}} Canadian Medical Hall of Fame|website=www.cdnmedhall.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}</ref> Working with doctoral student Thomas McKeown (1912\u201388), Selye published a report that used the word \u201cstress\u201d to describe these responses to adverse events.<ref>{{Citation|last=Koops|first=Matthias|chapter=Historical Account of the Substances Which have been Used to Describe Events, and to Convey Ideas, from the Earliest Date, to the Invention of Paper|pages=7\u2013258|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511694530|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511694530.002|year=2010|hdl=2027/gri.ark:/13960/t04x8wd2g|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\n\nHis last inspiration for ''[[general adaptation syndrome]]'' (GAS, a theory of [[Stress (biology)|stress]]) came from an endocrinological experiment in which he injected mice with extracts of various organs. He at first believed he had discovered a new hormone, but was proved wrong when every irritating substance he injected produced the same symptoms (swelling of the [[adrenal cortex]], atrophy of the [[thymus]], gastric and duodenal ulcers).<ref>Hans Selye, \"The General Adaptation Syndrome and the Diseases of Adaptation\" (two parts), \n''Journal of Allergy'' [later ''and Clinical Immunology''] 17/4 (July 1946): 231\u2013247; and 17/6 (Nov. 1946): 358-98.\nAvailable online at https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-8707(46)90148-7\nand (conclusion) https://www.jacionline.org/article/0021-8707(46)90159-1/pdf</ref> This, paired with his observation that people with different diseases exhibit similar symptoms, led to his description of the effects of \"noxious agents\" as he at first called it.

Selye conceptualized the physiology of stress as having two components: a set of responses which he called the \"[[general adaptation syndrome]]\", and the development of a pathological state from ongoing, unrelieved stress.\n\nSelye discovered and documented that stress differs from other physical responses in that stress is stressful whether one receives good or bad news, whether the impulse is positive or negative. He called negative stress \"[[Distress (medicine)|distress]]\" and positive stress \"[[eustress]]\". The system whereby the body copes with stress, the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) system, was also first described by Selye. He also pointed to an \"alarm state\", a \"resistance state\", and an \"exhaustion state\", largely referring to glandular states. Later he developed the idea of two \"reservoirs\" of stress resistance, or alternatively stress energy.\n\nSelye wrote ''The Stress of Life'' (1956), ''From Dream to Discovery: On Being a Scientist'' (1964) and ''Stress without Distress'' (1974). He worked as a professor and director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]].
