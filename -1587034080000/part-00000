This came to  US$438 million in 2015.<ref name=\"TJT-20170909\" />\n\n==Background==\n{{Politics of Thailand|Thai Garuda emblem.png}}\nThe Crown Property Bureau was established under the Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936 and became a juristic person in 1948. According to the act, a  Board of Crown Property was set up, to be chaired ''ex officio'' by the finance minister, and served by at least four royally-appointed directors. The king names one of the board members as the director-general of the CPB. The Board of Crown Property is responsible for the overall supervision of the activities of the Crown Property Bureau. Duties and responsibilities of the director-general are prescribed by the Board of Crown Property.\n\nInitially, the CPB was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Treasury of the [[Bureau of the Royal Household|Royal Household Bureau]]. On 21 April 1935, the 1934 act to exempt royal assets from taxation took effect. The act categorised royal assets into two types:\n\n#Assets eligible for tax exemption\n#Assets eligible for tax payment\n\nOn 19 July 1937, the Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936 became effective. It separated the royal assets into \"His Majesty's personal assets\", \"crown property\", and \"public property\". \"His Majesty's personal assets\" would be managed by the finance ministry. The CPB was set up with a status equivalent to a division under the treasury department of the finance ministry. Some of the functions, responsibilities, and officials were transferred from the Office of the Privy Purse to the Crown Property Bureau which sought permission to locate its office on the premises of the Office of the Privy Purse on the grounds of the [[Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]].\n\nThe Royal Assets Structuring Act has been amended three times: the second amendment (1941) took effect on 7 October 1941, the third amendment (1948) was promulgated on 18 February 1948 when the CPB's status was then elevated to a juristic person responsible for supervising, preserving, and managing crown property. The CPB director-general is authorized to affix his signature on behalf of the bureau. In July 2017, under the new bill, King [[Vajiralongkorn]] will set up a board of directors to oversee his assets. The king is entitled to appoint the board members, as well as to remove them, at his discretion. The law prohibits the taking away of royal assets without the king's approval. Under King [[Bhumibol]], the board of directors for the royal assets answered to the finance minister. Now it is independent of the government.<ref name=\"TJT-20170909\">{{cite news|last1=Chachavalpongpun|first1=Pavin|title=A very wealthy monarch grows wealthier|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/09/09/commentary/world-commentary/wealthy-monarch-grows-wealthier/|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=The Japan Times|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Crown Property Bureau has moved its office four times, with Ladawan Palace (commonly referred to as the \"Red Palace\") having been its home since 18 July 1946.

According to the act, a  Board of Crown Property was set up, to be chaired ''ex officio'' by the finance minister, and served by at least four royally-appointed directors. The king names one of the board members as the director-general of the CPB. The Board of Crown Property is responsible for the overall supervision of the activities of the Crown Property Bureau. Duties and responsibilities of the director-general are prescribed by the Board of Crown Property.\n\nInitially, the CPB was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Treasury of the [[Bureau of the Royal Household|Royal Household Bureau]]. On 21 April 1935, the 1934 act to exempt royal assets from taxation took effect. The act categorised royal assets into two types:\n\n#Assets eligible for tax exemption\n#Assets eligible for tax payment\n\nOn 19 July 1937, the Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936 became effective. It separated the royal assets into \"His Majesty's personal assets\", \"crown property\", and \"public property\". \"His Majesty's personal assets\" would be managed by the finance ministry. The CPB was set up with a status equivalent to a division under the treasury department of the finance ministry. Some of the functions, responsibilities, and officials were transferred from the Office of the Privy Purse to the Crown Property Bureau which sought permission to locate its office on the premises of the Office of the Privy Purse on the grounds of the [[Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]].\n\nThe Royal Assets Structuring Act has been amended three times: the second amendment (1941) took effect on 7 October 1941, the third amendment (1948) was promulgated on 18 February 1948 when the CPB's status was then elevated to a juristic person responsible for supervising, preserving, and managing crown property. The CPB director-general is authorized to affix his signature on behalf of the bureau. In July 2017, under the new bill, King [[Vajiralongkorn]] will set up a board of directors to oversee his assets. The king is entitled to appoint the board members, as well as to remove them, at his discretion. The law prohibits the taking away of royal assets without the king's approval. Under King [[Bhumibol]], the board of directors for the royal assets answered to the finance minister. Now it is independent of the government.<ref name=\"TJT-20170909\">{{cite news|last1=Chachavalpongpun|first1=Pavin|title=A very wealthy monarch grows wealthier|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/09/09/commentary/world-commentary/wealthy-monarch-grows-wealthier/|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=The Japan Times|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Crown Property Bureau has moved its office four times, with Ladawan Palace (commonly referred to as the \"Red Palace\") having been its home since 18 July 1946.

Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]].

Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984.
