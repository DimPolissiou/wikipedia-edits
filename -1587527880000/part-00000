Some in Cyrenaica think separation is the answer, noting that the region contains two-thirds of the oil of Libya, which holds the largest reserves in Africa.

When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty.

This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.<ref name=\"be202\" />\n\nZirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away.

Later, a general of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of a Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]]<ref name=\"be203\" /> independent from the Almohads. The Hafsids ruled Tripolitania for nearly 300 years. By the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nAfter weakening control of Abbasids, Cyrenaica was under Egypt based states such as [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517.

Another favorite way to serve Asida is with [[Rub (syrup)|rub]] (fresh date syrup) and olive oil. [[Usban]] is animal tripe stitched and stuffed with rice and vegetables cooked in tomato based soup or steamed. [[Chorba|Shurba]] is a red tomato sauce-based soup, usually served with small grains of pasta.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nA very common snack eaten by Libyans is known as ''khubs bi' tun'', literally meaning \"bread with tuna fish\", usually served as a baked baguette or pita bread stuffed with tuna fish that has been mixed with [[harissa]] (chili sauce) and olive oil. Many snack vendors prepare these sandwiches and they can be found all over Libya. Libyan restaurants may serve international cuisine, or may serve simpler fare such as lamb, chicken, vegetable stew, potatoes and [[macaroni]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Due to severe lack of infrastructure, many under-developed areas and small towns do not have restaurants and instead food stores may be the only source to obtain food products. Alcohol consumption is illegal in the entire country.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThere are four main ingredients of traditional Libyan food: [[olive]]s (and [[olive oil]]), [[Date palm|dates]], grains and milk.<ref name=\"Libyan Food\">{{cite web |url=http://www.temehu.com/Libyan-food.htm |title=Libyan Food |publisher=Temehu Tourism Services |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806045021/http://www.temehu.com/Libyan-food.htm |archivedate=6 August 2011  }}</ref> Grains are roasted, ground, sieved and used for making bread, cakes, soups and bazeen. Dates are harvested, dried and can be eaten as they are, made into syrup or slightly fried and eaten with [[bsisa]] and milk. After eating, Libyans often drink black tea. This is normally repeated a second time (for the second glass of tea), and in the third round of tea, it is served with roasted peanuts or roasted [[almond]]s known as ''shay bi'l-luz'' (mixed with the tea in the same glass).<ref name=\"Libyan Food\" />\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Libya}}\n{{Outdated as of | topic = '''post-23 October 2011 national [[Tertiary education|tertiary level]] education in Libya''' | last updated = 22 July 2006 | year = 2012 | month = 10 | day = 25 }}\n[[File:Piazza 28 Ottobre, Bengasi.jpg|thumb|Al Manar Royal Palace in central Benghazi \u2013 the location of the [[University of Libya]]'s first campus, founded by royal decree in 1955]]\nLibya's population includes 1.7&nbsp;million students, over 270,000 of whom study at the [[Tertiary education|tertiary level]].<ref name=\"Libedu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wes.org/eWENR/04July/Practical.htm |title=Education in Libya |author=Clark, Nick |publisher=World Education News and Reviews, Volume 17, Issue 4 |date=July 2004 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208081721/http://www.wes.org/ewenr/04July/Practical.htm |archivedate=8 February 2013  }}</ref> Basic education in Libya is free for all citizens,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0070) |title=Education of Libya |publisher=Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120921235353/lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ly0070) |archivedate=21 September 2012  }}</ref> and is compulsory up to the [[secondary education|secondary level]].

When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [[Fatimids]] controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]] as governor.<ref name=\"be202\" />\n\nIbn Ziri's Berber [[Zirid dynasty]] ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]] to North Africa. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.<ref name=\"be202\" />\n\nZirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [[Normans of Sicily]].<ref name=\"be203\">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 203.</ref> It was not until 1159 that the Moroccan [[Almohad]] leader [[Abd al-Mu'min]] reconquered Tripoli from European rule. For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [[Ayyubids]], the Almohad rulers and insurgents of the [[Banu Ghaniya]]. Later, a general of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of a Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]]<ref name=\"be203\" /> independent from the Almohads. The Hafsids ruled Tripolitania for nearly 300 years. By the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nAfter weakening control of Abbasids, Cyrenaica was under Egypt based states such as [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517. Finally [[Fezzan]] acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] rule.

This dish is commonly served at traditional weddings or festivities. [[Asida]] is a sweet version of Bazeen, made from white flour and served with a mix of honey, ghee or butter. Another favorite way to serve Asida is with [[Rub (syrup)|rub]] (fresh date syrup) and olive oil.

[[Chorba|Shurba]] is a red tomato sauce-based soup, usually served with small grains of pasta.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nA very common snack eaten by Libyans is known as ''khubs bi' tun'', literally meaning \"bread with tuna fish\", usually served as a baked baguette or pita bread stuffed with tuna fish that has been mixed with [[harissa]] (chili sauce) and olive oil.

{"title_page": "Crusade song", "text_new": "A '''Crusade song''' ({{lang-oc|canson de crozada}}, {{lang-ca|can\u00e7\u00f3 de croada}}, {{lang-de|Kreuzlied}}) is any [[vernacular]] [[lyric poem]] about the [[Crusades]]. Crusade songs were popular in the [[High Middle Ages]]: 106 survive in [[Occitan]], forty in [[Old French]], thirty in [[Middle High German]], two in [[Italian language|Italian]], and one in [[Old Spanish|Old Castilian]]. The study of the Crusade song, which may be considered a [[Literary genre|genre]] of its own, was pioneered by Kurt Lewent. He provided a classification of Crusade songs and distinguished between songs which merely mentioned, in some form, a Crusade from songs which were \"Crusade songs\".\n\nThe Crusade song was not confined to the topic of the [[Latin East]], but could concern the [[Reconquista]] in [[Spain]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in [[Languedoc]], or the political crusades in [[Italy]]. The first Crusade to be accompanied by songs, none of which survive, was the [[Crusade of 1101]], of which [[William IX of Aquitaine]] wrote, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]]. From the [[Second Crusade]] survive one French and ten Occitan songs. The [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Fourth Crusade]]s generated many songs in Occitan, French, and German. Occitan [[troubadours]] dealt especially with the Albigensian campaigns in the early thirteenth century, but their decline thereafter left the later Crusades&mdash;[[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]], [[Sixth Crusade|Sixth]], [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]], and [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]]&mdash;to be covered primarily by the German ''[[Minnesinger]]'' and French ''[[trouv\u00e8re]]s''.\n\n==List of Occitan crusading songs==\nThe following list is only of those songs defined as \"''Kreuzlied''\" in Lewent, \"Das altprovenzalische Kreuzlied\" (Berlin: 1905).

Crusade songs were popular in the [[High Middle Ages]]: 106 survive in [[Occitan]], forty in [[Old French]], thirty in [[Middle High German]], two in [[Italian language|Italian]], and one in [[Old Spanish|Old Castilian]]. The study of the Crusade song, which may be considered a [[Literary genre|genre]] of its own, was pioneered by Kurt Lewent. He provided a classification of Crusade songs and distinguished between songs which merely mentioned, in some form, a Crusade from songs which were \"Crusade songs\".\n\nThe Crusade song was not confined to the topic of the [[Latin East]], but could concern the [[Reconquista]] in [[Spain]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in [[Languedoc]], or the political crusades in [[Italy]]. The first Crusade to be accompanied by songs, none of which survive, was the [[Crusade of 1101]], of which [[William IX of Aquitaine]] wrote, according to [[Orderic Vitalis]]. From the [[Second Crusade]] survive one French and ten Occitan songs. The [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Fourth Crusade]]s generated many songs in Occitan, French, and German. Occitan [[troubadours]] dealt especially with the Albigensian campaigns in the early thirteenth century, but their decline thereafter left the later Crusades&mdash;[[Fifth Crusade|Fifth]], [[Sixth Crusade|Sixth]], [[Seventh Crusade|Seventh]], and [[Eighth Crusade|Eighth]]&mdash;to be covered primarily by the German ''[[Minnesinger]]'' and French ''[[trouv\u00e8re]]s''.\n\n==List of Occitan crusading songs==\nThe following list is only of those songs defined as \"''Kreuzlied''\" in Lewent, \"Das altprovenzalische Kreuzlied\" (Berlin: 1905).

The caprice, in the key of [[A minor]], consists of a [[theme (music)|theme]], 11 [[variation (music)|variations]], and a finale. His 24 Caprices were probably composed in 1807, while he was in the service of the [[Elisa Bonaparte|Baciocchi]] court.\n\nIt is widely considered one of the most difficult pieces ever written for the solo violin. It requires many highly advanced techniques such as [[parallel octaves]] and rapid shifting covering many [[Interval (music)|intervals]], extremely fast [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[arpeggio]]s including [[minor scale]]s, left hand [[pizzicato]], high positions, and quick string crossings.

He generalised this approach to assert that it explains many aspects of science, from [[evolution]] to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] which, in Sheldrake's formulation, are merely mutable habits that have been evolving and changing since the [[Big Bang]].\n\nJohn Davy wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' that the implications of ''A New Science of Life'' were \"fascinating and far-reaching, and would turn upside down a lot of orthodox science,\" and that they would \"merit attention if some of its predictions are supported by experiment.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Davy|first=J.|date=9 August 1981 |title=Old rats and new tricks |work=The Observer}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent books, Sheldrake continued to promote morphic resonance.\n\nThe morphic resonance hypothesis is rejected by numerous critics on many grounds, and has been labelled [[pseudoscience]] and [[magical thinking]]. These grounds include the lack of evidence for it and its inconsistency with established [[scientific theories]]. The idea of morphic resonance is also seen as lacking scientific credibility because it is overly vague and [[unfalsifiable]]. Furthermore, Sheldrake's experimental methods have been criticised for being poorly designed and subject to [[experimenter bias]].  His analyses of results have also drawn criticism.{{efn|Sources:\n* pseudoscience<ref name=gardner/><ref name=sharma/><ref name=samuel/><ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=rose/><ref name=impostures/><ref name=\"Jones\"/>\n* magical thinking<ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=\"Jones\"/><ref name=skepdic/>\n* lack of evidence<ref name=hood/><ref name=\"Blackmore 2009\"/><ref name=Rutherford/><ref name=sciam/><ref name=\"Rose 1988\"/>\n* inconsistency with established scientific theories<ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref name=\"Jones\"/><ref name=\"Blackmore 1999\"/>\n* overly vague<ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=rose/><ref name=\"Jones\"/><ref name=\"Parkin\"/>\n* unfalsifiable<ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=rose/><ref name=sciam/>\n* experimental methods poorly designed and subject to experimenter bias<ref name=MarksColwell/><ref name=\"Blackmore 1999\"/><ref name=alcock/>\n* analyses of results have also drawn criticism<ref name=rose/><ref name=wiseman2/>\n}}\n\n=== ''The Presence of the Past'' (1988)===\nIn ''The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature'' (1988), Sheldrake expanded on his morphic resonance hypothesis and marshalled experimental evidence which he said supported the hypothesis.<ref name=presencepast/> The book was reviewed favourably in ''[[New Scientist]]'' by historian [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], who called it \"engaging, provocative\" and \"a tour de force.\"<ref name=\"Roszak\"/> When the book was re-issued in 2011 with those quotes on the front cover, ''New Scientist'' remarked, \"Back then, Roszak gave Sheldrake the benefit of the doubt.

Sheldrake suggests that such interspecies telepathy is a real phenomenon and that morphic fields are responsible for it.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nThe book is in three sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, including [[animal migration]] and the [[Homing pigeon|homing of pigeons]], and on animal [[precognition]], including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of dogs and cats that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes for half an hour or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when she was on her way home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly [[Statistical significance|significant]] statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines.<ref name=\"the\">{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/if-the-truth-is-out-there-weve-not-found-it-yet/147748.article | title=If the truth is out there, we've not found it yet | work=Times Higher Education | date=30 August 1999 | accessdate=19 February 2015 |last=Blackmore|first=Susan}}</ref> Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nBefore the publication of ''Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home'', Sheldrake invited [[Richard Wiseman]], Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as an explanation for the dog's behaviour,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|last2=Smart|first2=Pamela |title=A Dog That Seems To Know When His Owner is Coming Home: Videotaped Experiments and Observations |journal=[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]] |date=2000 |volume=14 |pages=233\u2013255 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/a-dog-that-seems-to-know-when-his-owner-is-coming-home-videotaped-experiments-and-observations |accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from [[experimental design]], and [[post hoc analysis]] of unpublished data.<ref name=wiseman2/><ref name=wiseman1/> The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window.<ref name=wiseman2/> Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.<ref name=\"Commentary99\">{{cite journal | last=Sheldrake | first=Rupert | title=Commentary on a paper by Wiseman, Smith and Milton on the 'psychic pet' phenomenon | journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research | date=1999 | volume=63 | pages=306\u2013311 | url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/commentary-on-wiseman-smith-and-milton | accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the book, [[Susan Blackmore]] criticised Sheldrake for comparing the 12 tests of random duration \u2013 which were all less than an hour in duration \u2013 to the initial tests where the dog may have been responding to patterns in the owner's journeys.

Scientists around the world consistently get different measurements for such \"constants\" as the [[gravitational force]] or the [[speed of light]], he said, but they insist that the variation is attributable to experimental error, or they \"make up\" proportions of dark energy and matter to fit what they've observed into the established paradigm. \"What if the laws of nature vary throughout the day,\" Sheldrake asked. \"After much consideration, it seems that what Sheldrake is suggesting isn\u2019t as radical as it seems,\" concludes George Gillett for ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. \"What is surprising is the reliance modern science seems to have on opinions and dogmas, and how certain beliefs in science appear to be immune from scrutiny or inquiry.

He attributes the origin of his morphic resonance idea to two influences: his studies of the [[holistic]] tradition in biology, and French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s book ''[[Matter and Memory]]''. He says that he took Bergson's concept of memories not being materially embedded in the brain and generalised it to morphic resonance, where memories are not only immaterial but also under the influence of the collective past memories of similar organisms. While his colleagues at Cambridge were not receptive to the idea, Sheldrake found the opposite to be true in India. He recounts his Indian colleagues saying, \"There's nothing new in this, it was all known millennia ago to the ancient [[rishis]].\" Sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance as a convergence between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] thought, yet found by himself first in Western philosophy.<ref name=presencepast/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ebert |first=John David |title=From Cellular Aging to the Physics of Angels: A Conversation with Rupert Sheldrake |journal=The Quest |date=Spring 1998 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/D&C/interviews/Quest.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022014635/http://www.sheldrake.org/D%26C/interviews/Quest.html |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSheldrake has also noted similarities between morphic resonance and [[Carl Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]], with regard to collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, described by Jung as [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref name=presencepast/> However, whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms \"mechanistic biology.\"\n\n[[Lewis Wolpert]], one of Sheldrake's critics, has described morphic resonance as being an updated [[Hans Driesch|Drieschian]] [[vitalism]].<ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Cape|first=Jonathan|title=The believer and the sceptic|date=18 June 1986|page=11|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Full list of books ==\n* ''A New Science of Life: the hypothesis of formative causation'', Los Angeles, CA: J.P.

In 2009, [[Adam Rutherford]], geneticist and deputy editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', criticised Sheldrake's books for containing research that was not subjected to the [[peer-review]] process expected for science, and suggested that his books were best \"ignored.\"<ref name=Rutherford/>\n\n=== ''A New Science of Life'' (1981) ===\nSheldrake's ''A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance'' (1981) proposed that through morphic resonance, various perceived phenomena, particularly biological ones, become more probable the more often they occur, and that biological growth and behaviour thus become guided into patterns laid down by previous similar events. As a result, he suggested, newly-acquired behaviours can be passed down to future generations \u2212 a biological proposition akin to the [[Lamarckian inheritance]] theory. He generalised this approach to assert that it explains many aspects of science, from [[evolution]] to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] which, in Sheldrake's formulation, are merely mutable habits that have been evolving and changing since the [[Big Bang]].\n\nJohn Davy wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' that the implications of ''A New Science of Life'' were \"fascinating and far-reaching, and would turn upside down a lot of orthodox science,\" and that they would \"merit attention if some of its predictions are supported by experiment.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Davy|first=J.|date=9 August 1981 |title=Old rats and new tricks |work=The Observer}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent books, Sheldrake continued to promote morphic resonance.\n\nThe morphic resonance hypothesis is rejected by numerous critics on many grounds, and has been labelled [[pseudoscience]] and [[magical thinking]]. These grounds include the lack of evidence for it and its inconsistency with established [[scientific theories]]. The idea of morphic resonance is also seen as lacking scientific credibility because it is overly vague and [[unfalsifiable]]. Furthermore, Sheldrake's experimental methods have been criticised for being poorly designed and subject to [[experimenter bias]].

Sheldrake suggests that such interspecies telepathy is a real phenomenon and that morphic fields are responsible for it.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nThe book is in three sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, including [[animal migration]] and the [[Homing pigeon|homing of pigeons]], and on animal [[precognition]], including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of dogs and cats that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes for half an hour or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when she was on her way home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly [[Statistical significance|significant]] statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines.<ref name=\"the\">{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/if-the-truth-is-out-there-weve-not-found-it-yet/147748.article | title=If the truth is out there, we've not found it yet | work=Times Higher Education | date=30 August 1999 | accessdate=19 February 2015 |last=Blackmore|first=Susan}}</ref> Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nBefore the publication of ''Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home'', Sheldrake invited [[Richard Wiseman]], Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as an explanation for the dog's behaviour,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|last2=Smart|first2=Pamela |title=A Dog That Seems To Know When His Owner is Coming Home: Videotaped Experiments and Observations |journal=[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]] |date=2000 |volume=14 |pages=233\u2013255 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/a-dog-that-seems-to-know-when-his-owner-is-coming-home-videotaped-experiments-and-observations |accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from [[experimental design]], and [[post hoc analysis]] of unpublished data.<ref name=wiseman2/><ref name=wiseman1/> The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window.<ref name=wiseman2/> Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.<ref name=\"Commentary99\">{{cite journal | last=Sheldrake | first=Rupert | title=Commentary on a paper by Wiseman, Smith and Milton on the 'psychic pet' phenomenon | journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research | date=1999 | volume=63 | pages=306\u2013311 | url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/commentary-on-wiseman-smith-and-milton | accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the book, [[Susan Blackmore]] criticised Sheldrake for comparing the 12 tests of random duration \u2013 which were all less than an hour in duration \u2013 to the initial tests where the dog may have been responding to patterns in the owner's journeys.

Sheldrake says that the book led him to view contemporary scientific understanding of life as simply a [[paradigm]], which he called \"the mechanistic theory of life.\" Reading Kuhn's work, Sheldrake says, focused his mind on how scientific paradigms can change.<ref name=bio2/>\n\nSheldrake says that although there are similarities between morphic resonance and Hinduism's [[akashic records]],<ref name=Leviton/> he first conceived of the idea while at Cambridge, before his travel to India where he later developed it. He attributes the origin of his morphic resonance idea to two influences: his studies of the [[holistic]] tradition in biology, and French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s book ''[[Matter and Memory]]''. He says that he took Bergson's concept of memories not being materially embedded in the brain and generalised it to morphic resonance, where memories are not only immaterial but also under the influence of the collective past memories of similar organisms. While his colleagues at Cambridge were not receptive to the idea, Sheldrake found the opposite to be true in India. He recounts his Indian colleagues saying, \"There's nothing new in this, it was all known millennia ago to the ancient [[rishis]].\" Sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance as a convergence between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] thought, yet found by himself first in Western philosophy.<ref name=presencepast/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ebert |first=John David |title=From Cellular Aging to the Physics of Angels: A Conversation with Rupert Sheldrake |journal=The Quest |date=Spring 1998 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/D&C/interviews/Quest.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022014635/http://www.sheldrake.org/D%26C/interviews/Quest.html |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSheldrake has also noted similarities between morphic resonance and [[Carl Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]], with regard to collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, described by Jung as [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref name=presencepast/> However, whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms \"mechanistic biology.\"\n\n[[Lewis Wolpert]], one of Sheldrake's critics, has described morphic resonance as being an updated [[Hans Driesch|Drieschian]] [[vitalism]].<ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Cape|first=Jonathan|title=The believer and the sceptic|date=18 June 1986|page=11|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Full list of books ==\n* ''A New Science of Life: the hypothesis of formative causation'', Los Angeles, CA: J.P.
