In that year, the ''[[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|Book of Common Prayer]]'', presenting the theology of the [[English Reformation]], was introduced. The change was widely unpopular \u2013 particularly in areas of still firmly Catholic religious loyalty (even after the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy in 1534]]) such as [[Lancashire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Reformation: Lancashire|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/schools/content/constituency/ks3-reformation-constituencies-lancashire|website=historyofparliamentonline.org|publisher=The Crown|accessdate=2016-11-15}}</ref> Along with poor economic conditions, the enforcement of the English language liturgy led to an explosion of anger in Devon and Cornwall, initiating an uprising. In response, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] sent Lord John Russell to suppress the revolt.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Book of common prayer 1549.jpg|thumb|250px|Cranmer's Prayer book of 1549]]\nOne probable cause of the Prayer Book Rebellion was the religious changes recently implemented by the government of the new king, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. In the late 1540s, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Protector Somerset]], on behalf of the young king, introduced a range of legislative measures as an extension of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England and [[Wales]], the primary aim being to change theology and practices, particularly in areas of traditionally Roman Catholic religious loyalty \u2013 for example, in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]].<ref name=Payton>[[Philip Payton]], ''Cornwall'', Fowey: Alexander Associates, 1996</ref>\n\nWhen traditional religious [[procession]]s and [[pilgrimage]]s were banned, commissioners were sent out to remove all symbols of Catholicism, in line with [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s religious policies favouring Protestantism ever more. In Cornwall, this task was given to William Body, whose perceived desecration of religious [[shrine]]s led to his murder on 5 April 1548, by William Kylter and Pascoe Trevian at [[Helston]].<ref name=Payton />\n\nThis pressure on the lower classes was compounded by the recent [[Tax per head|poll tax]] on sheep.<ref>[[M.W. Beresford]], \"The Poll Tax and Census of Sheep, 1549\", ''Agricultural History Review'' 1(1), p 9</ref> This would have affected the region significantly, the West Country being an area of sheep farming.<ref>Barrett L. Beer, \"Rebellion and Riot: Popular Disorder in England During the Reign of Edward VI\" Available at: https://books.google.com/books?id=qc3kKakrbTUC</ref> Rumours circulating that the tax would be extended to other livestock may have increased the discontent.<ref>Jordan, p 463</ref>\n\nA damaged social structure then meant this local uprising was not sufficiently dealt with by landowners nearby. The [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], a large landowner in Sampford Courtenay, had recently been [[Attainder|attainted]]. His successor, Lord Russell, was based in London and rarely came out to his land. It is possible this created a lack of local power, that would have normally been expected to quell the revolt.<ref>W.K Jordan, \"Edward VI: The Young King\" London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1968, p 455\u2013458</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the roots of the rebellion can be traced back to Cornwall's own ancient wish for independence from England, meaning they were loath to accept new laws from a central government geographically distant from them.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Stoyle|title=The Cornish: A Neglected Nation?|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/cornish_nation_01.shtml#four}}</ref> More recently, the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] and the subsequent destruction of [[monastery|monasteries]] from 1536 through to 1545 under King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had brought an end to the formal scholarship, supported by the [[Religious Order|monastic orders]], that had sustained the Cornish and Devonian cultural identities. The dissolution of [[Glasney College]] and [[Crantock]] College played a significant part in fomenting opposition to future cultural reforms. It has been argued that the Catholic Church had \"proved itself extremely accommodating of Cornish language and culture\" and that government attacks on the traditional religion had reawakened the spirit of defiance in Cornwall, and in particular the majority Cornish-speaking far west.<ref name=Stoyle>Mark Stoyle, \"The dissidence of despair: rebellion and identity in early modern Cornwall.\" ''Journal of British Studies'', vol. 38, 1999, pp. 423\u2013444</ref>\n\nImmediate retribution followed with the execution of twenty-eight Cornishmen at [[Launceston Castle]]. One execution of a \"traitor of Cornwall\" occurred on [[Plymouth Hoe]] \u2013 town accounts give details of the cost of timber for both gallows and poles. Martin Geoffrey, the pro-Catholic priest of [[St Keverne]], near Helston, was taken to London. After Geoffrey's execution, his head was impaled on a staff erected upon London Bridge as was customary.<ref name=Payton />\n\n==Sampford Courtenay and the immediate beginnings of the uprising==\n[[File:scmap.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Sampford Courtenay]] is where the rebellion started, and where the rebels were defeated.]]\n\nThe new prayer book was not uniformly adopted, and in 1549 the [[Act of Uniformity 1549|Act of Uniformity]] made it unlawful to use the [[Latin liturgical rites]] from [[Whitsun]]day 1549 onwards. [[Magistrate]]s were given the task of enforcing the change. Following the enforced change on Whitsunday, on Whitmonday the parishioners of [[Sampford Courtenay]] in Devon compelled their priest to revert to the old service. The rebels argued that the new English liturgy was \"but lyke a Christmas game.\" This claim was probably related to the book's provision for men and women to file into the quire on different sides to receive the sacrament, which seemed to remind the Devon men of country dancing.<ref>[[Eamon Duffy]], ''The voices of Morebath: reformation and rebellion in an English village'', New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, p. 133.</ref> Justices arrived at the next service to enforce the change.  An altercation at the service led to a proponent of the change (William Hellyons) being killed by being run through with a [[pitchfork]] on the steps of the church house.<ref>[http://www.sampfordcourt.freeuk.com/Pages/Church3.html Sampford Courtenay \u2013 Saint Andrew's Church \u2013 3]</ref>\n\nFollowing this confrontation a group of parishioners from Sampford Courtenay decided to march to [[Exeter]] to protest at the introduction of the new prayer book.  As the group of rebels moved through Devon they gained large numbers of Catholic supporters and became a significant force.  Marching east to [[Crediton]], the Devon rebels laid siege to [[Exeter]], demanding the withdrawal of all English liturgies. Although a number of the inhabitants in Exeter sent a message of support to the rebels, the city refused to open its gates.  The gates were to stay closed because of the siege for over a month.<ref name=Payton />\n\n===\"Kill all the gentlemen\"===\n[[File:Thomas Cranmer by Gerlach Flicke.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Cranmer]], chief author of the [[Book of Common Prayer]]]]\n[[File:Edward Seymour.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The response of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], was swift and crushing.]]\nIn Cornwall and Devon, the issue of the Book of Common Prayer proved to be the final indignity that the people could peaceably bear. Two decades of oppression were followed by two years of rampant inflation, in which wheat prices had quadrupled.<ref>[[A. L. Rowse]], ''Tudor Cornwall'', London: Macmillan, 1969, p. 262</ref> Along with the rapid [[enclosure]] of common lands, the attack on the Church, which was felt to be central to the rural community, led to an explosion of anger.  In Cornwall, an army gathered at the town of [[Bodmin]] under the leadership of its mayor, Henry Bray, and two staunch Catholic landowners, [[Humphrey Arundell|Sir Humphrey Arundell]] of [[Helland]] and John Winslade of Tregarrick.<ref name=\"Payton\" />\n\nMany of the [[gentry]] sought protection in old castles.  Some shut themselves in [[St Michael's Mount]] where they were besieged by the rebels, who started a bewildering smoke-screen by burning [[trusses of hay]]. This, combined with a shortage of food and the distress of women, forced them to surrender. Sir [[Richard Grenville (died 1550)|Richard Grenville]] found refuge in the ruins of [[Trematon Castle]].  Deserted by many of his followers, the old man was enticed outside to [[parley]]. He was seized and the castle ransacked. Sir Richard and his companions were imprisoned in Launceston gaol. The Cornish army then proceeded to march east across the [[River Tamar|Tamar]] border into Devon to join with the Devon rebels near Crediton.\n\nThe religious aims of the rebellion were highlighted in the slogan \"Kill all the gentlemen and we will have the [[Thirty-Nine Articles#Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] up again, and ceremonies as they were in [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]]'s time.\" However, it also implies a social cause (a view supported by historians such as Guy and Fletcher).  That later demands included limiting the size of households belonging to the gentry \u2013 theoretically beneficial in a time of population growth and unemployment \u2013 possibly suggests an attack on the prestige of the gentry.  Certainly such contemporaries as [[Thomas Cranmer]] took this view, condemning the rebels for deliberately inciting a class conflict by their demands: \"to diminish their strength and to take away their friends, that you might command gentlemen at your pleasures\".<ref>Cranmer's reply to the rebels has been published in: ''The Works of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury'', ed. J. E. Cox, Parker Society publications, 2 vols., Cambridge University Press, 1844\u20131846, vol. 2, pp. 163\u2013187</ref> Protector Somerset himself saw dislike of the gentry as a common factor in all of the 1549 rebellions: \"indeed all hath conceived a wonderful hate against the gentlemen and taketh them all as their enemies.\"<ref>Somerset to Sir Philip Hobby, 24 August 1549. In: [[Gilbert Burnet]], ''The history of the Reformation of the Church of England'', ed. [[Nicholas Pocock (historian)|Nicholas Pocock]], Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1865, vol. V., pp. 250\u2013151.

Manning, \"Violence and social conflict in mid-Tudor rebellions,\" ''Journal of British Studies'', vol. 16, 1977, pp. 18\u201340 (here p. 28)</ref>\n\nThe Cornish rebels were also concerned with the use of the English language in the new prayer book. The language-map of Cornwall at this time is quite complicated, but philological studies have suggested that the Cornish language had been in territorial retreat throughout the Middle Ages.<ref>M. F. Wakelin, ''Language and history in Cornwall'', Leicester University Press, 1975; Also: K. J. George, \"How many people spoke Cornish traditionally?\" ''Cornish Studies'', o.s. 14, 1986, pp. 67\u201370</ref> Summarising these researches, [[Mark Stoyle]] says that by 1450, the county was divided into three main linguistic blocs: \"West Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Celtic descent, which was mostly Cornish speaking; the western part of East Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Celtic descent, which had largely abandoned the Cornish tongue in favor of English; and the eastern part of East Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Anglo-Saxon descent, which was entirely English speaking.\"<ref name=Stoyle />\n\nIn any case, the West Cornish reacted badly to the introduction of English in the 1549 services. The eighth Article of the ''Demands of the Western Rebels'' states: \"and so we the Cornyshe men (whereof certen of us understande no Englysh) utterly refuse thys newe English\".<ref>\"The Demands of the Western Rebels, 1549.\" In: Anthony Fletcher and [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], ''Tudor Rebellions'', 5th ed, Harlow: Pearson Longman, 2004, pp. 151\u2013153</ref> Responding to this, however, Archbishop Cranmer asked why the Cornishmen should be offended by holding the service in English rather than [[Cornish language|Cornish]], when they had before held it in [[Latin language|Latin]] and not understood that.<ref name=Payton />\n\n==Confrontations==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}\nIn London, King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and his [[Privy Council]] became alarmed by this news from the West Country. On instructions from the [[Lord Protector]] the [[Duke of Somerset]], one of the Privy Councillors, Sir Gawen Carew, was ordered to ''pacify'' the rebels. At the same time Lord John Russell was ordered to take an army to impose a military solution.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe rebels were of many different backgrounds, some farmers, some tin miners, and some fishermen. Cornwall appears to have had a significantly larger militia than other areas of a similar size.<ref name=Payton />\n\n===Crediton confrontation===\nAfter the rebels passed [[Plymouth]], Devonian knights Sir Gawen and Sir [[Peter Carew]] were sent to negotiate, meeting the Devon rebels at [[Crediton]].<ref>[http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/prayer_book_rebellion.htm]{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|self published website; and Jorge H. Castelli is not an expert|date=January 2015}} \"Tudor Place : The Prayerbook Rebellion\"</ref> They found the approaches blocked and were attacked by [[Longbow|longbowmen]]. Shortly before, the Cornish rebels arrived and Arundell now divided his combined force, sending one force to [[Clyst St Mary]] to assist the villagers, with the main army advancing upon Exeter, where it besieged the city for 5 weeks.<ref>[http://www.cornishworldmagazine.co.uk/content/view/77/54/1/8/ Cornish World \u2013 War of June\u2013August 1549]</ref>\n\n===The Siege of Exeter===\nThe rebel commanders unsuccessfully tried to persuade [[John Blackaller]], [[Exeter]]'s pro-Catholic mayor, to surrender the town. The city gates were closed as the initial force of some 2,000 gathered outside.\n\n===Battle of Fenny Bridges===\nOn 2 July Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford]]'s initial force had reached Honiton. It included 160 Italian arquebusiers and a thousand [[landsknecht]]s, German footsoldiers, under the command of [[William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord William Grey]]. With promised reinforcements from [[Wiltshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], Russell would have more than 8,600 men, including a cavalry force of 850 men, all of them well armed and well trained. Russell had estimated the combined rebel forces from Cornwall and Devon at only 7,000 men. On 28 July Arundell decided to block their approach to Exeter at Fenny Bridges. The result of this conflict was inconclusive and around 300 on each side were reported to have died with Lord Russell and his army returning to Honiton.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Philip Payton]]. (1996). ''Cornwall''. Fowey: Alexander Associates</ref>\n\n===Battle of Woodbury Common===\nLord Russell\u2019s reinforcements arrived on 2 August and his army of 5000 men began a march upon Exeter, westward, across the downs. Russell\u2019s advance continued on to [[Woodbury Common, Devon|Woodbury Common]] where they pitched camp. On 4 August the rebels attacked but the result was inconclusive with large numbers of prisoners taken by Lord Russell.\n\n===Battle of Clyst St Mary===\nArundell's forces re-grouped with the main contingent of 6,000 at [[Clyst St Mary]], but on 5 August were attacked by a central force led by Sir William Francis. After a ferocious battle Russell's troops gained the advantage leaving a thousand Cornish and Devonians dead and many more taken prisoner.\n\n===Clyst Heath massacre===\nRussell pitched camp on [[Clyst Heath]] and had 900 bound and gagged rebel prisoners killed, their throats slit in 10 minutes according to the chronicler [[John Hayward (historian)|John Hayward]].\n\n===Battle of Clyst Heath===\nWhen news of the atrocity reached Arundell's forces a new attack took place early on 6 August. Lord Grey was later to comment that he had never seen the like, nor taken part in such a murderous fray. As he had led the charge against the Scots in the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]], this was a telling statement. Some 2000 died at the battle of Clyst Heath. A group of Devon men went north up the valley of the Exe, where they were overtaken by Sir Gawen Carew, who left the corpses of their leaders hanging on gibbets from Dunster to Bath.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Relief of Exeter===\nLord Russell continued his attack with the relief of Exeter. In London, a proclamation was issued allowing the lands of those involved in the uprising to be confiscated. Arundell's estates were transferred to Sir Gawen Carew and Sir Peter Carew was rewarded with all of John Winslade's Devon estates.\n\n===Battle of Sampford Courtenay===\n{{main|Battle of Sampford Courtenay}}\nLord Russell was under the impression that the rebels had been defeated but news arrived that Arundell's army was re-grouping at [[Sampford Courtenay]]. This interrupted his plans to send 1,000 men into Cornwall by ship to cut off his enemy's retreat. Russell's forces were strengthened by the arrival of a force under Provost Marshal Sir [[Anthony Kingston]]. His army now numbered more than 8,000, vastly outnumbering what remained of his opposition. Lord Grey and Sir William Herbert led the attack and contemporary Exeter historian [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]] wrote that 'the Cornish would not give in until most of their number had been slain or captured.'  Lord John Russell reported that his army had killed between five and six hundred and his pursuit of the Cornish retreat killed a further seven hundred.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:DSCN1948PenrynPrayerBookRebellionMemorial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], Prayer Book Rebellion Memorial, near the site of [[Glasney College]].]]\nMany escaped, including Arundell, who fled to [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]. There, he was later to be captured and taken to London with Winslade, who was caught at Bodmin. In total, over 5,500 people lost their lives in the rebellion. Further orders were issued on behalf of the king by the [[Lord Protector]] the [[Duke of Somerset]] and Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]] for the continuance of the onslaught. Under Sir [[Anthony Kingston]], English and mercenary forces then moved throughout [[Devon]] and into [[Cornwall]] and executed or killed many people before the bloodshed finally ceased. Proposals to translate the Prayer Book into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] were also suppressed.\n\nThe loss of life in the Prayer Book Rebellion and subsequent reprisals as well as the introduction of the English Prayer Book is seen as a turning point in the Cornish language, for which \u2013 unlike [[Welsh language|Welsh]] \u2013 a complete [[bible translation]] was not produced. Research has also suggested that, prior to the rebellion, the Cornish language had strengthened and more concessions had been made to Cornwall as a \"nation\", and that anti-English sentiment had been growing stronger, providing additional impetus for the rebellion.<ref>[[James Whetter]], ''The history of Glasney College'', Tabb House, 1988</ref>\n\n==Bishop of Truro's apology for the response to the Rebellion==\nIn June 2007, the then [[Bishop of Truro]], the Right Revd [[Bill Ind]], was reported as saying that the massacre during the vicious suppression of the Prayer Book Rebellion more than 450 years ago was an \"enormous mistake\" for which the [[Church of England]] should be ashamed.<ref name=WesternMorningNews>[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144125&command=displayContent&sourceNode=232510&home=yes&more_nodeId1=232470&contentPK=17697818 Bishop Bill apologises for Cornish massacre \u2013 Western Morning News \u2013 June 2007]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Speaking at a ceremony at [[Pelynt]], he said:\n\n\"I am often asked about my attitude to the Prayerbook Rebellion and in my opinion, there is no doubt that the [[English Government]] behaved brutally and stupidly and killed many [[Cornish people]].

In that year, the ''[[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|Book of Common Prayer]]'', presenting the theology of the [[English Reformation]], was introduced. The change was widely unpopular \u2013 particularly in areas of still firmly Catholic religious loyalty (even after the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy in 1534]]) such as [[Lancashire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Reformation: Lancashire|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/schools/content/constituency/ks3-reformation-constituencies-lancashire|website=historyofparliamentonline.org|publisher=The Crown|accessdate=2016-11-15}}</ref> Along with poor economic conditions, the enforcement of the English language liturgy led to an explosion of anger in Devon and Cornwall, initiating an uprising. In response, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] sent Lord John Russell to suppress the revolt.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Book of common prayer 1549.jpg|thumb|250px|Cranmer's Prayer book of 1549]]\nOne probable cause of the Prayer Book Rebellion was the religious changes recently implemented by the government of the new king, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. In the late 1540s, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Lord Protector Somerset]], on behalf of the young king, introduced a range of legislative measures as an extension of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England and [[Wales]], the primary aim being to change theology and practices, particularly in areas of traditionally Roman Catholic religious loyalty \u2013 for example, in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]].<ref name=Payton>[[Philip Payton]], ''Cornwall'', Fowey: Alexander Associates, 1996</ref>\n\nWhen traditional religious [[procession]]s and [[pilgrimage]]s were banned, commissioners were sent out to remove all symbols of Catholicism, in line with [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s religious policies favouring Protestantism ever more. In Cornwall, this task was given to William Body, whose perceived desecration of religious [[shrine]]s led to his murder on 5 April 1548, by William Kylter and Pascoe Trevian at [[Helston]].<ref name=Payton />\n\nThis pressure on the lower classes was compounded by the recent [[Tax per head|poll tax]] on sheep.<ref>[[M.W. Beresford]], \"The Poll Tax and Census of Sheep, 1549\", ''Agricultural History Review'' 1(1), p 9</ref> This would have affected the region significantly, the West Country being an area of sheep farming.<ref>Barrett L. Beer, \"Rebellion and Riot: Popular Disorder in England During the Reign of Edward VI\" Available at: https://books.google.com/books?id=qc3kKakrbTUC</ref> Rumours circulating that the tax would be extended to other livestock may have increased the discontent.<ref>Jordan, p 463</ref>\n\nA damaged social structure then meant this local uprising was not sufficiently dealt with by landowners nearby. The [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], a large landowner in Sampford Courtenay, had recently been [[Attainder|attainted]]. His successor, Lord Russell, was based in London and rarely came out to his land. It is possible this created a lack of local power, that would have normally been expected to quell the revolt.<ref>W.K Jordan, \"Edward VI: The Young King\" London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1968, p 455\u2013458</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the roots of the rebellion can be traced back to Cornwall's own ancient wish for independence from England, meaning they were loath to accept new laws from a central government geographically distant from them.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Stoyle|title=The Cornish: A Neglected Nation?|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/cornish_nation_01.shtml#four}}</ref> More recently, the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] and the subsequent destruction of [[monastery|monasteries]] from 1536 through to 1545 under King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had brought an end to the formal scholarship, supported by the [[Religious Order|monastic orders]], that had sustained the Cornish and Devonian cultural identities. The dissolution of [[Glasney College]] and [[Crantock]] College played a significant part in fomenting opposition to future cultural reforms. It has been argued that the Catholic Church had \"proved itself extremely accommodating of Cornish language and culture\" and that government attacks on the traditional religion had reawakened the spirit of defiance in Cornwall, and in particular the majority Cornish-speaking far west.<ref name=Stoyle>Mark Stoyle, \"The dissidence of despair: rebellion and identity in early modern Cornwall.\" ''Journal of British Studies'', vol. 38, 1999, pp. 423\u2013444</ref>\n\nImmediate retribution followed with the execution of twenty-eight Cornishmen at [[Launceston Castle]]. One execution of a \"traitor of Cornwall\" occurred on [[Plymouth Hoe]] \u2013 town accounts give details of the cost of timber for both gallows and poles. Martin Geoffrey, the pro-Catholic priest of [[St Keverne]], near Helston, was taken to London. After Geoffrey's execution, his head was impaled on a staff erected upon London Bridge as was customary.<ref name=Payton />\n\n==Sampford Courtenay and the immediate beginnings of the uprising==\n[[File:scmap.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Sampford Courtenay]] is where the rebellion started, and where the rebels were defeated.]]\n\nThe new prayer book was not uniformly adopted, and in 1549 the [[Act of Uniformity 1549|Act of Uniformity]] made it unlawful to use the [[Latin liturgical rites]] from [[Whitsun]]day 1549 onwards. [[Magistrate]]s were given the task of enforcing the change. Following the enforced change on Whitsunday, on Whitmonday the parishioners of [[Sampford Courtenay]] in Devon compelled their priest to revert to the old service. The rebels argued that the new English liturgy was \"but lyke a Christmas game.\" This claim was probably related to the book's provision for men and women to file into the quire on different sides to receive the sacrament, which seemed to remind the Devon men of country dancing.<ref>[[Eamon Duffy]], ''The voices of Morebath: reformation and rebellion in an English village'', New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, p. 133.</ref> Justices arrived at the next service to enforce the change.  An altercation at the service led to a proponent of the change (William Hellyons) being killed by being run through with a [[pitchfork]] on the steps of the church house.<ref>[http://www.sampfordcourt.freeuk.com/Pages/Church3.html Sampford Courtenay \u2013 Saint Andrew's Church \u2013 3]</ref>\n\nFollowing this confrontation a group of parishioners from Sampford Courtenay decided to march to [[Exeter]] to protest at the introduction of the new prayer book.  As the group of rebels moved through Devon they gained large numbers of Catholic supporters and became a significant force.  Marching east to [[Crediton]], the Devon rebels laid siege to [[Exeter]], demanding the withdrawal of all English liturgies. Although a number of the inhabitants in Exeter sent a message of support to the rebels, the city refused to open its gates.  The gates were to stay closed because of the siege for over a month.<ref name=Payton />\n\n===\"Kill all the gentlemen\"===\n[[File:Thomas Cranmer by Gerlach Flicke.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Cranmer]], chief author of the [[Book of Common Prayer]]]]\n[[File:Edward Seymour.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The response of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], was swift and crushing.]]\nIn Cornwall and Devon, the issue of the Book of Common Prayer proved to be the final indignity that the people could peaceably bear. Two decades of oppression were followed by two years of rampant inflation, in which wheat prices had quadrupled.<ref>[[A. L. Rowse]], ''Tudor Cornwall'', London: Macmillan, 1969, p. 262</ref> Along with the rapid [[enclosure]] of common lands, the attack on the Church, which was felt to be central to the rural community, led to an explosion of anger.  In Cornwall, an army gathered at the town of [[Bodmin]] under the leadership of its mayor, Henry Bray, and two staunch Catholic landowners, [[Humphrey Arundell|Sir Humphrey Arundell]] of [[Helland]] and John Winslade of Tregarrick.<ref name=\"Payton\" />\n\nMany of the [[gentry]] sought protection in old castles.  Some shut themselves in [[St Michael's Mount]] where they were besieged by the rebels, who started a bewildering smoke-screen by burning [[trusses of hay]]. This, combined with a shortage of food and the distress of women, forced them to surrender. Sir [[Richard Grenville (died 1550)|Richard Grenville]] found refuge in the ruins of [[Trematon Castle]].  Deserted by many of his followers, the old man was enticed outside to [[parley]]. He was seized and the castle ransacked. Sir Richard and his companions were imprisoned in Launceston gaol. The Cornish army then proceeded to march east across the [[River Tamar|Tamar]] border into Devon to join with the Devon rebels near Crediton.\n\nThe religious aims of the rebellion were highlighted in the slogan \"Kill all the gentlemen and we will have the [[Thirty-Nine Articles#Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] up again, and ceremonies as they were in [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry]]'s time.\" However, it also implies a social cause (a view supported by historians such as Guy and Fletcher).  That later demands included limiting the size of households belonging to the gentry \u2013 theoretically beneficial in a time of population growth and unemployment \u2013 possibly suggests an attack on the prestige of the gentry.  Certainly such contemporaries as [[Thomas Cranmer]] took this view, condemning the rebels for deliberately inciting a class conflict by their demands: \"to diminish their strength and to take away their friends, that you might command gentlemen at your pleasures\".<ref>Cranmer's reply to the rebels has been published in: ''The Works of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury'', ed. J. E. Cox, Parker Society publications, 2 vols., Cambridge University Press, 1844\u20131846, vol. 2, pp. 163\u2013187</ref> Protector Somerset himself saw dislike of the gentry as a common factor in all of the 1549 rebellions: \"indeed all hath conceived a wonderful hate against the gentlemen and taketh them all as their enemies.\"<ref>Somerset to Sir Philip Hobby, 24 August 1549. In: [[Gilbert Burnet]], ''The history of the Reformation of the Church of England'', ed. [[Nicholas Pocock (historian)|Nicholas Pocock]], Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1865, vol. V., pp. 250\u2013151.

Manning, \"Violence and social conflict in mid-Tudor rebellions,\" ''Journal of British Studies'', vol. 16, 1977, pp. 18\u201340 (here p. 28)</ref>\n\nThe Cornish rebels were also concerned with the use of the English language in the new prayer book. The language-map of Cornwall at this time is quite complicated, but philological studies have suggested that the Cornish language had been in territorial retreat throughout the Middle Ages.<ref>M. F. Wakelin, ''Language and history in Cornwall'', Leicester University Press, 1975; Also: K. J. George, \"How many people spoke Cornish traditionally?\" ''Cornish Studies'', o.s. 14, 1986, pp. 67\u201370</ref> Summarising these researches, [[Mark Stoyle]] says that by 1450, the county was divided into three main linguistic blocs: \"West Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Celtic descent, which was mostly Cornish speaking; the western part of East Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Celtic descent, which had largely abandoned the Cornish tongue in favor of English; and the eastern part of East Cornwall was inhabited by a population of Anglo-Saxon descent, which was entirely English speaking.\"<ref name=Stoyle />\n\nIn any case, the West Cornish reacted badly to the introduction of English in the 1549 services. The eighth Article of the ''Demands of the Western Rebels'' states: \"and so we the Cornyshe men (whereof certen of us understande no Englysh) utterly refuse thys newe English\".<ref>\"The Demands of the Western Rebels, 1549.\" In: Anthony Fletcher and [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], ''Tudor Rebellions'', 5th ed, Harlow: Pearson Longman, 2004, pp. 151\u2013153</ref> Responding to this, however, Archbishop Cranmer asked why the Cornishmen should be offended by holding the service in English rather than [[Cornish language|Cornish]], when they had before held it in [[Latin language|Latin]] and not understood that.<ref name=Payton />\n\n==Confrontations==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}\nIn London, King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and his [[Privy Council]] became alarmed by this news from the West Country. On instructions from the [[Lord Protector]] the [[Duke of Somerset]], one of the Privy Councillors, Sir Gawen Carew, was ordered to ''pacify'' the rebels. At the same time Lord John Russell was ordered to take an army to impose a military solution.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe rebels were of many different backgrounds, some farmers, some tin miners, and some fishermen. Cornwall appears to have had a significantly larger militia than other areas of a similar size.<ref name=Payton />\n\n===Crediton confrontation===\nAfter the rebels passed [[Plymouth]], Devonian knights Sir Gawen and Sir [[Peter Carew]] were sent to negotiate, meeting the Devon rebels at [[Crediton]].<ref>[http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/prayer_book_rebellion.htm]{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|self published website; and Jorge H. Castelli is not an expert|date=January 2015}} \"Tudor Place : The Prayerbook Rebellion\"</ref> They found the approaches blocked and were attacked by [[Longbow|longbowmen]]. Shortly before, the Cornish rebels arrived and Arundell now divided his combined force, sending one force to [[Clyst St Mary]] to assist the villagers, with the main army advancing upon Exeter, where it besieged the city for 5 weeks.<ref>[http://www.cornishworldmagazine.co.uk/content/view/77/54/1/8/ Cornish World \u2013 War of June\u2013August 1549]</ref>\n\n===The Siege of Exeter===\nThe rebel commanders unsuccessfully tried to persuade [[John Blackaller]], [[Exeter]]'s pro-Catholic mayor, to surrender the town. The city gates were closed as the initial force of some 2,000 gathered outside.\n\n===Battle of Fenny Bridges===\nOn 2 July Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford]]'s initial force had reached Honiton. It included 160 Italian arquebusiers and a thousand [[landsknecht]]s, German footsoldiers, under the command of [[William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord William Grey]]. With promised reinforcements from [[Wiltshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], Russell would have more than 8,600 men, including a cavalry force of 850 men, all of them well armed and well trained. Russell had estimated the combined rebel forces from Cornwall and Devon at only 7,000 men. On 28 July Arundell decided to block their approach to Exeter at Fenny Bridges. The result of this conflict was inconclusive and around 300 on each side were reported to have died with Lord Russell and his army returning to Honiton.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Philip Payton]]. (1996). ''Cornwall''. Fowey: Alexander Associates</ref>\n\n===Battle of Woodbury Common===\nLord Russell\u2019s reinforcements arrived on 2 August and his army of 5000 men began a march upon Exeter, westward, across the downs. Russell\u2019s advance continued on to [[Woodbury Common, Devon|Woodbury Common]] where they pitched camp. On 4 August the rebels attacked but the result was inconclusive with large numbers of prisoners taken by Lord Russell.\n\n===Battle of Clyst St Mary===\nArundell's forces re-grouped with the main contingent of 6,000 at [[Clyst St Mary]], but on 5 August were attacked by a central force led by Sir William Francis. After a ferocious battle Russell's troops gained the advantage leaving a thousand Cornish and Devonians dead and many more taken prisoner.\n\n===Clyst Heath massacre===\nRussell pitched camp on [[Clyst Heath]] and had 900 bound and gagged rebel prisoners killed, their throats slit in 10 minutes according to the chronicler [[John Hayward (historian)|John Hayward]].\n\n===Battle of Clyst Heath===\nWhen news of the atrocity reached Arundell's forces a new attack took place early on 6 August. Lord Grey was later to comment that he had never seen the like, nor taken part in such a murderous fray. As he had led the charge against the Scots in the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]], this was a telling statement. Some 2000 died at the battle of Clyst Heath. A group of Devon men went north up the valley of the Exe, where they were overtaken by Sir Gawen Carew, who left the corpses of their leaders hanging on gibbets from Dunster to Bath.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Relief of Exeter===\nLord Russell continued his attack with the relief of Exeter. In London, a proclamation was issued allowing the lands of those involved in the uprising to be confiscated. Arundell's estates were transferred to Sir Gawen Carew and Sir Peter Carew was rewarded with all of John Winslade's Devon estates.\n\n===Battle of Sampford Courtenay===\n{{main|Battle of Sampford Courtenay}}\nLord Russell was under the impression that the rebels had been defeated but news arrived that Arundell's army was re-grouping at [[Sampford Courtenay]]. This interrupted his plans to send 1,000 men into Cornwall by ship to cut off his enemy's retreat. Russell's forces were strengthened by the arrival of a force under Provost Marshal Sir [[Anthony Kingston]]. His army now numbered more than 8,000, vastly outnumbering what remained of his opposition. Lord Grey and Sir William Herbert led the attack and contemporary Exeter historian [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]] wrote that 'the Cornish would not give in until most of their number had been slain or captured.'  Lord John Russell, reported that his army had killed between five and six hundred and his pursuit of the Cornish retreat killed a further seven hundred.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:DSCN1948PenrynPrayerBookRebellionMemorial.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]], Prayer Book Rebellion Memorial, near the site of [[Glasney College]].]]\nMany escaped, including Arundell, who fled to [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]. There, he was later to be captured and taken to London with Winslade, who was caught at Bodmin. In total, over 5,500 people lost their lives in the rebellion. Further orders were issued on behalf of the king by the [[Lord Protector]] the [[Duke of Somerset]] and Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]] for the continuance of the onslaught. Under Sir [[Anthony Kingston]], English and mercenary forces then moved throughout [[Devon]] and into [[Cornwall]] and executed or killed many people before the bloodshed finally ceased. Proposals to translate the Prayer Book into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] were also suppressed.\n\nThe loss of life in the Prayer Book Rebellion and subsequent reprisals as well as the introduction of the English Prayer Book is seen as a turning point in the Cornish language, for which \u2013 unlike [[Welsh language|Welsh]] \u2013 a complete [[bible translation]] was not produced.

This is a grant of certain commercial privileges by the Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander]] to the Polish merchants of [[Lviv|Lvov]]. However, as buildings older than 1408 still exist, e.g. the Armenian Church believed to be originally built in 1395, it is certain that the city existed before its first surviving written mention.\n\n===Capital of Moldavia===\nAround 1564, Prince [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u015fneanu|Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] moved the Moldavian capital from [[Suceava]] to Ia\u0219i. Between 1561 and 1563, a school and a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church were founded by the [[Greeks|Greek]] adventurer Prince, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]].\n[[File:Iglesia_Trei_Ierarhi_(acabada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (1639)]]\n[[File:Iassy-1701.jpg|thumb|Ia\u0219i in the 1700s]]\n[[File:Princely Court of Jassy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Culture (Ia\u015fi)|Princely Court of Moldavia]]]]\nIn 1640, [[Vasile Lupu]] established the first school in which the Romanian language replaced Greek, and set up a printing press in the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (''Monastery of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs|Three Hierarchs]]''; built 1635\u201339). Between 15 September - 27 October 1642, the city hosted the [[Synod of Jassy]] (also referred to as the Council of Jassy). In 1643, the first volume ever printed in [[Moldavia]] was published in Ia\u0219i.\n\nThe city was burned down by the [[Nogais|Tatars]] in 1513, by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1538, and by [[Imperial Russia]]n troops in 1686. In 1734, it was hit by the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIt was through the [[Peace of Ia\u015fi|Peace of Ia\u0219i]] that the sixth [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Russo-Turkish War]] was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek revolutionary manoeuvre and occupation under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792\u20131828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] (\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a5\u03c8\u03b7\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) and the [[Filiki Eteria]] (\u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1) (1821, at the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]]) led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822. In 1844 a severe fire affected much of the city.\n\n===Mid\u201319th century to 20th century===\n[[File:Iasi str al lapusneanu.jpg|thumb|left|Al. L\u0103pu\u0219neanu Street]]\n[[File:Statuia lui Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Ia\u015fi3.jpg|thumb|right|Union Square]]\nBetween 1564 and 1859, the city was the capital of Moldavia; then, between 1859 and 1862, both Ia\u0219i and [[Bucharest]] were de facto capitals of the [[United Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1862, when the union of the two principalities was recognised under the name of ''Romania'', the national capital was established in Bucharest. For the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] voted 148,150 [[Romanian leu|lei]] to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment was ever made.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Ia\u0219i was the capital of a much reduced Romania for two years, following the [[Central Powers]]' occupation of Bucharest on 6 December 1916. The capital was returned to Bucharest after the defeat of [[Imperial Germany]] and its allies in November 1918. In November\u2013December 1918 Ia\u0219i hosted the [[Jassy Conference]].\n\n===Jewish community===\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Romania}}\nIa\u0219i also figures prominently in [[Jew]]ish history, with the first documented presence of [[Sephardi Jews]] from the late 16th century.

The words of [[HaTikvah]], the national anthem of [[Israel]], were written in Ia\u0219i by [[Naftali Herz Imber]]. Jewish musicians in Ia\u0219i played an important role as preservers of Yiddish folklore, as performers and composers.\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, with a population of 34,662 (some 34% of the city's population), Jews were the second largest ethnic group in Ia\u0219i. There were over 127 [[synagogue]]s. \nAfter [[World War II]], in 1947, there were about 38,000 Jews living in Ia\u0219i. Because of massive emigration to Israel, in 1975 there were about 3,000 Jews living in Ia\u0219i and four synagogues were active.<ref name=\"yivo\"/>\n\nCurrently, Ia\u0219i has a dwindling Jewish population of ca. 300 to 600 members and two working synagogues, one of which, the 1671 [[Great Synagogue (Ia\u015fi)|Great Synagogue]], is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest surviving synagogue]] in Romania.<ref>[https://www.wmf.org/project/great-synagogue-ia%C5%9Fi Great Synagogue of Ia\u0219i] at wmf.org</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n{{Main|Ia\u0219i pogrom}}\nDuring the war, while the full scale of [[the Holocaust]] remained generally unknown to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], the [[Ia\u015fi pogrom|Ia\u0219i pogrom]] stood as one of the known examples of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] brutality toward the Jews.

This is a grant of certain commercial privileges by the Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander]] to the Polish merchants of [[Lviv|Lvov]]. However, as buildings older than 1408 still exist, e.g. the Armenian Church believed to be originally built in 1395, it is certain that the city existed before its first surviving written mention.\n\n===Capital of Moldavia===\nAround 1564, Prince [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u015fneanu|Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] moved the Moldavian capital from [[Suceava]] to Ia\u0219i. Between 1561 and 1563, a school and a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church were founded by the [[Greeks|Greek]] adventurer Prince, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]].\n[[File:Iglesia_Trei_Ierarhi_(acabada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (1639)]]\n[[File:Iassy-1701.jpg|thumb|Ia\u0219i in the 1700s]]\n[[File:Princely Court of Jassy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Culture (Ia\u015fi)|Princely Court of Moldavia]]]]\nIn 1640, [[Vasile Lupu]] established the first school in which the Romanian language replaced Greek, and set up a printing press in the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (''Monastery of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs|Three Hierarchs]]''; built 1635\u201339). Between 15 September - 27 October 1642, the city hosted the [[Synod of Jassy]] (also referred to as the Council of Jassy). In 1643, the first volume ever printed in [[Moldavia]] was published in Ia\u0219i.\n\nThe city was burned down by the [[Nogais|Tatars]] in 1513, by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1538, and by [[Imperial Russia]]n troops in 1686. In 1734, it was hit by the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIt was through the [[Peace of Ia\u015fi|Peace of Ia\u0219i]] that the sixth [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Russo-Turkish War]] was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek revolutionary manoeuvre and occupation under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792\u20131828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] (\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a5\u03c8\u03b7\u03bb\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) and the [[Filiki Eteria]] (\u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1) (1821, at the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]]) led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822. In 1844 a severe fire affected much of the city.\n\n===Mid\u201319th century to 20th century===\n[[File:Iasi str al lapusneanu.jpg|thumb|left|Al. L\u0103pu\u0219neanu Street]]\n[[File:Statuia lui Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Ia\u015fi3.jpg|thumb|right|Union Square]]\nBetween 1564 and 1859, the city was the capital of Moldavia; then, between 1859 and 1862, both Ia\u0219i and [[Bucharest]] were de facto capitals of the [[United Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1862, when the union of the two principalities was recognised under the name of ''Romania'', the national capital was established in Bucharest. For the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] voted 148,150 [[Romanian leu|lei]] to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment was ever made.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Ia\u0219i was the capital of a much reduced Romania for two years, following the [[Central Powers]]' occupation of Bucharest on 6 December 1916. The capital was returned to Bucharest after the defeat of [[Imperial Germany]] and its allies in November 1918. In November\u2013December 1918 Ia\u0219i hosted the [[Jassy Conference]].\n\n===Jewish community===\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Romania}}\nIa\u0219i also figures prominently in [[Jew]]ish history, with the first documented presence of [[Sephardi Jews]] from the late 16th century.

The words of [[HaTikvah]], the national anthem of [[Israel]], were written in Ia\u0219i by [[Naftali Herz Imber]]. Jewish musicians in Ia\u0219i played an important role as preservers of Yiddish folklore, as performers and composers.\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, with a population of 34,662 (some 34% of the city's population), Jews were the second largest ethnic group in Ia\u0219i. There were over 127 [[synagogue]]s. \nAfter [[World War II]], in 1947, there were about 38,000 Jews living in Ia\u0219i. Because of massive emigration to Israel, in 1975 there were about 3,000 Jews living in Ia\u0219i and four synagogues were active.<ref name=\"yivo\"/>\n\nCurrently, Ia\u0219i has a dwindling Jewish population of ca. 300 to 600 members and two working synagogues, one of which, the 1671 [[Great Synagogue (Ia\u015fi)|Great Synagogue]], is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest surviving synagogue]] in Romania.<ref>[https://www.wmf.org/project/great-synagogue-ia%C5%9Fi Great Synagogue of Ia\u0219i] at wmf.org</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n{{Main|Ia\u0219i pogrom}}\nDuring the war, while the full scale of [[the Holocaust]] remained generally unknown to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], the [[Ia\u015fi pogrom|Ia\u0219i pogrom]] stood as one of the known examples of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] brutality toward the Jews.
