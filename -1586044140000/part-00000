Meanwhile, a penniless young physician, Ronald Fausset, loves Lady Violet Anstruther. The two couples wed secretly, but the Registrar switches the names on the marriage certificates, so that Guy is joined to Lady Violet, and Ronald to Josephine.\n\nChesterton founds a horticultural college and sends Zaccary (Josephine's father) to Peru to seek a special $2,000 orchid, the orchid of his dreams. Zaccary is supposed to take the flower to [[Nice, France]], for a competitive exhibition. However, Zaccary is unreliable and goes to Paris instead, in search of flowers of the human variety. Fortunately, it is discovered that Meakin, the gardener at the horticultural college, is growing a nearly identical orchid.\n\n==Roles and original cast==\n[[File:The-Orchid-Wedding-Dance.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fausset, Violet, Meakin, Josephine and Guy in the Wedding Dance]]\n*Lady Violet Anstruther (principal pupil at the horticultural college) \u2013 [[Gertie Millar]]\n*Caroline Twining (of a matrimonial turn) \u2013 [[Connie Ediss]]  \n*Zelie Rumbert (an adventuress) \u2013 Hilda Jacobsen  \n*Thisbe (private secretary to Mr. Chesterton) \u2013 [[Gabrielle Ray]]\n*Countess Anstruther (Violet's mother) \u2013 Phyllis Blair\n*Billy (Dr. Fausset's \"Buttons\") \u2013 Lydia West  \n*Lady Warden (of the horticultural college) \u2013 Gertrude Aylward  \n*Josephine Zaccary (pupil teacher at the horticultural college) \u2013 Ethel Sydney  \n*The Hon.

That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in its own interests. </blockquote><blockquote>Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated reference to \u2018pressures\u2019, \u2018strains\u2019 and unspecified \u2018problems\u2019. On occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed.  </blockquote><blockquote>The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There is no doubt it should have been. </blockquote>The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said: <blockquote>Newspapers don\u2019t report suicides, so the public doesn\u2019t hear about the broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don\u2019t understand why. It doesn\u2019t end when the abuse ends.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/case_study_28_-_findings_report_-_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat2.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat - Report of Case Study No. 28|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|pages=433\u2013436}}</ref></blockquote>Other harms are outlined.

concluding: \"The most likely explanation for the conduct of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior clergy in the Diocese was that they were trying to minimise the risk of scandal and protect the

That failure led to the suffering and often irreparable harm to children, their families and the wider community. That harm could have been avoided if the Church had acted in the interests of children rather than in its own interests. </blockquote><blockquote>Euphemistic and elliptical language was often used in correspondence and minutes to mask the true nature of the conduct discussed. There was repeated reference to \u2018pressures\u2019, \u2018strains\u2019 and unspecified \u2018problems\u2019. On occasions, records were deliberately not made or kept or were destroyed.  </blockquote><blockquote>The result of these inexcusable failures was that more children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy in the Diocese. There was a catastrophic institutional failure which resulted in many children being sexually abused. We heard about the devastating, often lifelong, consequences in the lives of those children. The welfare of children was not the primary concern of Bishop Mulkearns and other senior members of the Diocese when responding to complaints and allegation of child sexual abuse against their priests. There is no doubt it should have been. </blockquote>The report on Ballarat also described the impact it had on victims. One section outlines suicide and premature death caused from the abuse. One victim said: <blockquote>Newspapers don\u2019t report suicides, so the public doesn\u2019t hear about the broken families and their shattered lives, about the unseen impact of institutional child sexual abuse. Children are left behind and they don\u2019t understand why. It doesn\u2019t end when the abuse ends.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/case_study_28_-_findings_report_-_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat_catholic_church_authorities_in_ballarat2.pdf|title=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat - Report of Case Study No. 28|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|pages=433\u2013436}}</ref></blockquote>Other harms are outlined.

In Warrnambool seven Catholic priests and Christian Brothers abused children in an almost-continuous stream of paedophile clerics employed between 1963 and 1994. Ballarat diocese and Christian Brothers were also exporting known paedophiles to the US under the guise of \u201ctreatment\u201d.

Intended as the last number in Act II, Scene I, \"In Dahomey\" is performed by a purported group of African natives featured in an exhibit at the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]]. The song begins with the \"natives\" chanting in what is supposedly an African language. After the watching crowd disperses, they switch to singing in an American dialect, revealing they are American blacks playing roles, not Dahomey natives.<ref name=duggan>Mary Kay Duggan, \"Publishing California Sheet Music: San Francisco Midwinter Exposition,\" ''Quarterly Newsletter of the Book Club of California'' (2010).</ref> The lyrics expressed the relief of the \"natives\" that they could soon go home to their New York apartments.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=10538 ''Show Boat'', Ziegfeld Theatre.

After the 1946 revival of ''Show Boat'' on Broadway, the song \"In Dahomey\" was omitted from the score of ''Show Boat'' and from the cast album recorded of that Broadway production. It has never been used in a film version of the show. It is one of the few songs having no connection to the musical's storyline.\n\nThe song was recorded three times as part of the full musical: in 1928 by the original chorus who performed in the first London production of the show; in 1988 by the [[Ambrosian Chorus]] with [[John McGlinn]] conducting, who included it in his landmark 1988 [[EMI]] recording of the complete score of ''Show Boat''; and in 1993 for the Studio Cast recording of the 1946 revival version.\n\n===1999 revival===\nA revival of ''In Dahomey'', of title and songs only, was produced at the [[Henry Street Settlement]] from June 23-July 25, 1999 in New York City.

One ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report responded to the show by construing it as the initiation of a potential [[race war]], signifying the level of anxiety possessed around the mobility of blacks during the era.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Music ==\n\n[[File:ImAJohnahManWilliamsWalkerCover.jpeg|thumb|upright|Sheet music cover for \"The Jonah Man\"]]\n''In Dahomey'' captures much of the perspective of early 20th-century Broadway. Many songs feature classic vaudevillian elements and dramatic flexibility. Fewer than a half-dozen songs were topically linear to ''In Dahomey''{{'}}s driving narrative. Only two songs, \"My Dahomian Queen\" and \"On Broadway in Dahomey Bye and Bye\", refer to the locations and plot integration. Many songs, such as \"Brown-Skin Baby Mine\", \"My Castle on the Nile\", \"Evah Dahkey Is a King\", \"When It's All Goin' Out and Nothin' Comin In\", and \"Good Evenin'\", have been performed in other vaudevillian Broadway shows.<ref name=\"Riis, Thomas L 1996\"/>\n\n=== Musical numbers ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These works had different themes, staging and locales.<ref name=\"W. W. Norton & Company\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[Percy Grainger]] wrote a virtuosic concert [[Ragtime|rag]] entitled ''In Dahomey (Cakewalk Smasher)'', in which he blended tunes from Cook's show and [[Arthur Pryor]]'s popular cakewalk number, \"[[A Coon Band Contest]]\".<ref name=ould>Ould, Barry Peter (1996).

He started composing his rag that year, completing the score some six years later, in 1909.<ref name=ould/>\n\n===Song from ''Show Boat''===\nIn 1894 the comedian Bert Williams was hired to play an African \"native\" at the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894]]. The [[Dahomey]] natives who had been in the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]] were late reaching San Francisco, where they were again supposed to occupy the African pavilion.<ref name=duggan/>\n\nHaving learned of the use of African and other foreign people in exhibits at the fairs, [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] wrote a song, \"In Dahomey\", for their 1927 musical, ''[[Show Boat]].'' Intended as the last number in Act II, Scene I, \"In Dahomey\" is performed by a purported group of African natives featured in an exhibit at the [[1893 Chicago World's Fair]]. The song begins with the \"natives\" chanting in what is supposedly an African language. After the watching crowd disperses, they switch to singing in an American dialect, revealing they are American blacks playing roles, not Dahomey natives.<ref name=duggan>Mary Kay Duggan, \"Publishing California Sheet Music: San Francisco Midwinter Exposition,\" ''Quarterly Newsletter of the Book Club of California'' (2010).</ref> The lyrics expressed the relief of the \"natives\" that they could soon go home to their New York apartments.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=10538 ''Show Boat'', Ziegfeld Theatre. IBDb.]</ref> This scene earlier features the \"Act II Opening (Sports of Gay Chicago)\" and the hit love song \"Why Do I Love You?\"\n\nThe song was never a hit. After the 1946 revival of ''Show Boat'' on Broadway, the song \"In Dahomey\" was omitted from the score of ''Show Boat'' and from the cast album recorded of that Broadway production. It has never been used in a film version of the show. It is one of the few songs having no connection to the musical's storyline.\n\nThe song was recorded three times as part of the full musical: in 1928 by the original chorus who performed in the first London production of the show; in 1988 by the [[Ambrosian Chorus]] with [[John McGlinn]] conducting, who included it in his landmark 1988 [[EMI]] recording of the complete score of ''Show Boat''; and in 1993 for the Studio Cast recording of the 1946 revival version.\n\n===1999 revival===\nA revival of ''In Dahomey'', of title and songs only, was produced at the [[Henry Street Settlement]] from June 23-July 25, 1999 in New York City. It was written and directed by [[Shauneille Perry]], who created a new script inspired by characters and songs from the original.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/first-legit-african-american-musical-in-dahomey-inspires-new-version-in-nyc-82730 Kenneth Jones, \"First Legit African-American Musical, In Dahomey, Inspires New Version in NYC June 23-July 25\"], ''Playbill'', 23 June 1999; accessed 10 February 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[List of African American firsts]]\n*[[African American musical theater]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060303224348/http://www.si.umich.edu/CHICO/Harlem/timex/1903.html \"1903 in Harlem culture\"], Univ. of Michigan\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|In Dahomey}}\n* Jones, Kenneth. \"[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/first-legit-african-american-musical-in-dahomey-inspires-new-version-in-nyc-82730 First Legit African-American Musical, In Dahomey, Inspires New Version in NYC June 23-July 25]\", ''Playbill'', 22 June 1999\n\n*[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=5695 ''In Dahomey'' Broadway 1903 at Internet Broadway Database]\n*[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/12478/In-Dahomey ''In Dahomey'' Broadway 1904 at PlaybillVault]\n*[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_i/InDahomey.html ''In Dahomey'' at Guide to Musical Theatre]\n*[https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/musa/publications/musa-5-in-dahomey \"'In Dahomey' at Music of the United States of America (MUSA)]\n*{{IBDB show | 4672 | In Dahomey}}\n\n\n[[Category:Broadway musicals]]\n[[Category:1903 musicals]]\n[[Category:African-American theatre]]\n[[Category:All-Black cast Broadway shows]]\n[[Category:Works by Paul Laurence Dunbar]]\n", "name_user": "Loriendrew", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Dahomey"}
