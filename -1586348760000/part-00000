Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally seen as marking the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|end of the Western Roman Empire]].{{efn|\"Odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned over Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind.\" [[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter XXXVI.{{sfn|Gibbon|1998|p=716}}}}\n\nThough the real power in [[Italy]] was in his hands, he represented himself as the [[patronage in ancient Rome|client]] of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor|emperor in Constantinople]], [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. Odoacer generally used the Roman honorific ''patrician,'' granted by the Zeno at the time, but was referred to as a king ({{lang-la|rex}}) in many documents. He himself used it in the only surviving official document that emanated from his chancery, and it was also used by the [[consul]] [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Basilius]].{{sfn|Martindale|1980|p=791\u2013793}}{{efn|[[Marcellinus Comes|Marcellinus]], [[Cassiodorus]], and some [[Papal]] documents, which come the closest to implying official use of the title, all refer to him as ''rex'' (or one of its declensions). [[Jordanes]] at one point refers to him as ''Gothorum Romanorumque regnator'': ruler of the Goths and the Romans. He is called an ''autokrator'' (autocrat) and a ''tyrannos'' (usurper, tyrant) in [[Procopius]]' ''Bellum Gothicum''. The only reference to Odoacer as \"King of Italy\" is in [[Victor Vitensis]]: ''Odouacro Italiae regi''.}} Odoacer introduced few important changes into the administrative system of Italy. He had the support of the [[Roman Senate]] and was able to distribute land to his followers without much opposition. Unrest among his warriors led to violence in 477\u2013478, but no such disturbances occurred during the later period of his reign. Although Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], he rarely intervened in the affairs of the [[Trinitarian]] [[state church of the Roman Empire]].<!-- explained below in the article; a cite here should not be necessary -->\n\nLikely of [[East Germanic]] descent, Odoacer was a military leader in Italy who led the revolt of [[Heruli]]an, [[Rugians|Rugian]], and [[Scirian]] soldiers that deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]] on 4 September AD 476. Augustulus had been declared Western Roman Emperor by his father, the rebellious general of the army in Italy, less than a year before, but had been unable to gain allegiance or recognition beyond central Italy. With the backing of the Roman Senate, Odoacer thenceforth ruled Italy autonomously, paying lip service to the authority of [[Julius Nepos]], the previous Western emperor, and Zeno, the emperor of the East. Upon Nepos's murder in 480 Odoacer invaded [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], to punish the murderers. He did so, executing the conspirators, but within two years also conquered the region and incorporated it into his domain.\n\nWhen [[Illus]], master of soldiers of the Eastern Empire, asked for Odoacer's help in 484 in his struggle to depose Zeno, Odoacer invaded Zeno's westernmost provinces. The emperor responded first by inciting the [[Rugii]] of present-day [[Austria]] to attack [[Italy]]. During the winter of 487\u2013488 Odoacer crossed the [[Danube]] and defeated the Rugii in their own territory. Zeno also appointed the [[Ostrogothic|Ostrogoth]] [[Theodoric the Great]] who was menacing the borders of the Eastern Empire, to be king of Italy, turning one troublesome, nominal vassal against another.  Theodoric invaded Italy in 489 and by August 490 had captured almost the entire peninsula, forcing Odoacer to take refuge in [[Ravenna]]. The city surrendered on 5 March 493; Theodoric invited Odoacer to a banquet of reconciliation and instead of forging an alliance, killed the unsuspecting king.\n\n==Ethnicity==\nExcept for the fact that he was not considered ''Roman'', Odoacer's precise ethnic origins are not known.{{efn|For more on this, see: Stefan Krautschick, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435971 \"Zwei Aspekte des Jahres 476\", ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte''], '''35''' (1986), pp. 344\u2013371.}} Most scholars consider him to be at least partly of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] descent. It can however be said that his family origins lie in the empire of [[Attila]].\n\n[[Jordanes]] associated him with several of the [[East Germanic]] tribes of the [[Middle Danube]] who had arrived there during the time of Attila's empire, including the [[Scirii]], [[Heruli]], and [[Rugii]]. In several passages he named him king of the [[Turcilingi]], which is a people, or perhaps a dynasty, that is mentioned by no other historical source. Modern historians also propose connections with [[Goths]], [[Huns]] or the [[Thuringii]]. While in one passage in his ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the [[Turcilingi]] (''Torcilingorum rex'') with Scirii and Heruli followers.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}}, in another passage (LVII.291) he mentions Italy during Odoacer's reign being under the tyranny of Turcilingi and Rogii. In his ''[[Romana (Jordanes)|Romana]]'', the same author defines Odoacer as a descendant of the [[Rugii]] (or of a person named Rogus, ''Odoacer genere Rogus'') with Turcilingi, Rugian and Heruli followers.{{efn|See:Jordanes, ''Romana'' 344.}} It has been pointed out that Attila had an uncle of the name Rogus and suggested that Odoacer may have been seen as his descendant.{{sfn|Reynolds|1946|p=44}}\n\nIn a fragment from a history of [[Priscus]], reproduced by [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], Odoacer is described as a man of the Scirii, the son of Edeco, and brother of [[Onoulphus|Hunuulf]] who killed [[Armatus]] in the eastern Roman empire.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=98\u201399}} However, it is unclear whether this Edeko is identical to one\u2014or both\u2014men of the same name who lived at this time: one was an ambassador of [[Attila]] to the court in [[Constantinople]], and escorted [[Priscus]] and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp. He was described by Priscus as a Hun. The other is mentioned by [[Jordanes]] as a leader of the [[Scirii]], along with Hunuulf (perhaps his son), who were soundly defeated by the Ostrogoths at the [[Battle of Bolia]] in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]] about 469. {{efn|See: Priscus, fragments 7 and 8, translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 70\u201393}} \n\nThe ''[[Anonymus Valesianus]]'' agrees that his father's name was [[Edeko]] (Edika), and refers to him leading Scirii and Heruli. \n\n[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] calls him a [[Goths|Goth]].{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=284}} The sixth-century chronicler, [[Marcellinus Comes]], calls him \"the king of the Goths\" (''Odoacer rex Gothorum''). {{efn|Marcellinus Comes, ''Chronicon'', s. a. 476.}}\n\nMedieval scholar, Michael Frasetto, reports that Odoacer was of Scirian heritage,{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}} as do others;{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=699}} while historian, Erik Jensen, avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father, Edeco, was a [[Hun]].{{sfn|Jensen|2018|p=16}}\n\nAfter reviewing the primary sources, Bruce Macbain argues that \"The ancient sources exhibit considerable confusion over Odovacer's tribal affiliation, identifying him variously as a Skirian, a Rogian and/or Torcilingian, a Herul, and even a Goth;\" he subsequently concludes that \"not a single source calls him a Hun.\"{{sfn|Macbain|1983|p=325}} Historian Penny MacGeorge points out that the confusion about Odoacer's ethnicity is exaggerated and that the claims he was a Hun \"can almost certainly be dismissed;\" she asserts instead that Odoacer was \"surely Germanic.\"{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=286}}\n\n===Onomastic evidence===\nThe origin of the name Odoacer, which may give indications as to his tribal affiliation, is debated. One suggestion is that Odoacer is derived from the Germanic ''[[Audawakrs|*Audawakraz]]'' (Gothic ''*Audawakrs''), from ''aud-'' \"wealth\" and ''wakr-'' \"vigilant\" or combined, \"watcher of the wealth.\"{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=699}} This form finds a cognate in another Germanic language, the titular ''Eadwacer'' of the Old English poem ''[[Wulf and Eadwacer]]'' (where Old English renders the earlier Germanic sound ''au-'' as ''ea-'').{{sfn|Voyles|1992|p=141}} On the other hand, historians Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez explored the possibility that the name Odoacer was not Germanic, making several arguments that his ethnic background might lie elsewhere. One of these is that his name, \"Odoacer\", for which an etymology in Germanic languages had not been convincingly found, could be a form of the [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] \"Ot-toghar\" (\"grass-born\" or \"fire-born\"), or the shorter form \"Ot-ghar\" (\"herder\").{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}}\n\n== Before Italy ==\nPossibly the earliest recorded incident involving Odoacer is from a fragment of a chronicle preserved in the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' of [[Gregory of Tours]]. Two chapters of his work recount, in a confused or confusing manner, a number of battles fought by King [[Childeric I]] of the Franks, [[Aegidius]], Count Paul, and one \"[[Adovacrius]]\" or \"Odovacrius\".{{sfn|Gregory of Tours|1974|p=132 [II.18\u201319]}} If this is an account of Aegidius' victory over the [[Visigoths]], otherwise known from the ''Chronicle'' of [[Hydatius]], then this occurred in 463. Reynolds and Lopez, in their article mentioned above, suggested that this \"Adovacrius\" or \"Odovacrius\" may be the same person as the future king of Italy.{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}} \n\nThe first certain act recorded for Odoacer was shortly before he arrived in Italy. [[Eugippius]], in his ''Life of Saint Severinus'', records how a group of barbarians on their way to Italy had stopped to pay their respects to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time \"a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes\", learned from [[Severinus of Noricum|Severinus]] that he would one day become famous.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} Despite that Odoacer was an Arian Christian and Severinus was Catholic, the latter left a deep impression on him.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: \"Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.\"{{sfn|Eugippius|1965|p=64}}{{efn|Bieler explains in a footnote that \"make rich gifts to many\" refers to the custom of Germanic war leaders giving lavishly to their followers, because \"generosity was one of the virtues which a king was supposed to have.\"}}\n\n==Leader of the ''foederati''==\nBy 470, Odoacer had become an officer in what remained of the Roman Army. Although Jordanes writes of Odoacer as invading Italy \"as leader of the Sciri, the [[Heruli]] and allies of various races\",{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}} modern writers describe him as being part of the Roman military establishment, based on [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]]'s statement that Odoacer was on the side of [[Ricimer]] at the beginning of his battle with the emperor [[Anthemius]] in 472.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}}{{efn|Also See: John of Antioch, fragment 209; translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 122. [[Procopius]] describes him as one of the Emperor's bodyguards, only agreeing to this position if placed in charge of them.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|p=251 [5.1.6]}}}} In his capacity as a soldier suddenly pitted against Anthemius, since he had switched sides to join with Ricimer, Odoacer had \"hastened the emperor's downfall.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=184}} \n\n[[File:Romulus Augustulus and Odoacer.jpg|thumb|left|Romulus Augustus resigns the Crown (from a 19th-century illustration).]]\n\nWhen [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]] was in 475 appointed ''[[Magister militum]]'' and [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] by the Western Roman Emperor [[Julius Nepos]], Odoacer became head of the Germanic ''[[foederati]]'' of Italy (the Scirian\u2014Herulic ''foederati''). Under the command of Orestes were significant contingents of Germanic peoples made up mostly of Rugii and Heruli tribesmen.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Before the end of that year Orestes had rebelled and driven Nepos from Italy.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Orestes then proclaimed his young son Romulus the new emperor as [[Romulus Augustulus|Romulus Augustus, called \"Augustulus\"]] (31 October).{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=405}} At this time, Odoacer was a soldier rising through the ranks.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|pp=63\u201364}} However, Nepos reorganized his court in [[Salona]], Dalmatia and received homage and affirmation from the remaining fragments of the Western Empire beyond Italy and, most importantly, from Constantinople, which refused to accept Augustulus, Zeno having branded him and his father as traitors and usurpers.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=190}}\n\nAbout this time the ''foederati'', who had been quartered in Italy all of these years, had grown weary of this arrangement. In the words of [[J. B. Bury]], \"They desired to have roof-trees and lands of their own, and they petitioned Orestes to reward them for their services, by granting them lands and settling them permanently in Italy\".{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} Orestes refused their petition, and they turned to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] along with his brother Paulus outside [[Ravenna]]. The Germanic ''foederati,'' the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer ''rex Italiae'' (\"king of Italy\").{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} In 476 Odoacer advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on 4 September. According to the ''Anonymus Valesianus'', Odoacer was moved by Romulus's youth and his beauty to not only spare his life but give him a pension of 6,000 ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' and sent him to [[Campania]] to live with his relatives.{{sfn|Bernard|1970|p=19}}{{efn|Also see: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 8.38.

The message was clear: the West no longer required a separate Emperor, for \"one monarch sufficed [to rule] the world\". In response, Zeno accepted their gifts and this essentially brought to end any puppet emperors in the West, with Nepos banished and Anthemius dead.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=407}} The Eastern Emperor then conferred upon Odoacer the title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] and granted him legal authority to govern Italy in the name of Rome.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=428\u2013429}} Zeno also suggested that Odoacer should receive Nepos back as Emperor in the West,{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=429}} \"if he truly wished to act with justice.\"{{efn|See:Malchus, fragment 10, translated in C. D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila'', pp. 127\u2013129.}} Although he accepted the title of Patrician from Zeno, Odoacer did not invite Julius Nepos to return to Rome, and the latter remained in Dalmatia until his death. Odoacer was careful to observe form, however, and made a pretence of acting on Nepos's authority, even issuing coins with both his image and that of Zeno.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=219}} Following Nepos's murder in 480, who was killed while waiting in Dalmatia,{{sfn|Bunson|1995|p=292}} Zeno became sole Emperor.{{sfn|Grant|1998|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nBury, however, disagrees that Odoacer's assumption of power marked the fall of the Roman Empire:\n{{bquote|It stands out prominently as an important stage in the process of the dismemberment of the Empire. It belongs to the same catalogue of chronological dates which includes A.D. 418, when Honorius settled the Goths in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]], and A.D. 435, when [[Valentinian III|Valentinian]] ceded African lands to the [[Vandals]]. In A.D. 476 the same principle of disintegration was first applied to Italy. The settlement of Odovacar's East Germans, with Zeno's acquiescence, began the process by which Italian soil was to pass into the hands of Ostrogoths and [[Lombards]], [[Franks]] and [[Normans]]. And Odovacar's title of king emphasised the significance of the change.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}}}}\n\n==King of Italy<!--'Kingdom of Italy (476\u2013493)' redirects here-->==\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = ''Regnum Italicum''\n|conventional_long_name = Kingdom of Italy\n|common_name            = Italy\n|era                    = [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]]\n|government_type        = [[Monarchy]]\n|year_start             = 476\n|year_end               = 493\n|status                 = [[Vassal state]]\n|status_text            = [[Vassal state]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]\n|event_start            = [[Battle of Ravenna (476)|Battle of Ravenna]]\n|date_start             = 2 September\n|event_end              = [[Theodoric the Great]] assassinates Odoacer\n|date_end               = 2 February\n|event1                 = [[Romulus Augustulus]] abdicates\n|date_event1            = 4 September 476\n|p1                     = Roman Italy{{!}}Italia\n|p2                     = Sicilia (Roman province){{!}}Sicilia\n|p3                     = Dalmatia (Roman province){{!}}Dalmatia\n|flag_p1                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|flag_p2                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|flag_p3                = Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|border_p1              = no\n|border_p2              = no\n|border_p3              = no\n|s1                     = Ostrogothic Kingdom\n|flag_s1                = Teodorico re dei Goti (493-526) white.jpg\n|image_flag             = \n|flag                   =\n|flag_type              =\n|image_coat             =\n|symbol_type_article    =\n|symbol_type            =\n|image_map              = Odoacer 480ad.jpg\n|image_map_caption      = The Kingdom of Italy (under Odoacer) in 480 AD.\n|capital                = [[Ravenna]]\n|common_languages       = [[Latin language|Latin]]<br>[[Vulgar Latin]]<br>[[Gothic language|Gothic]]\n|religion               = [[Arianism]]<br>[[Chalcedonian Christianity]]\n|currency               = [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]]\n|leader1                = Odoacer\n|year_leader1           = 476\u2013493 AD\n|title_leader           = [[King of Italy#Rex Itialiae|Rex]]\n|legislature            = [[Roman Senate]]\n}}\n\nIn 476, the barbarian warlord Odoacer founded the Kingdom of Italy as its first [[King of Italy|king]], initiating a new era over Roman lands. According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he \"slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.243]}} He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighboring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]] to cede Sicily to him. Noting that \"Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November\", F.M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476.{{sfn|Clover|1999|p=237}} When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=410}}\n\nAs Bury points out, \"It is highly important to observe that Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.\" He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the [[Consul]]ate and other prestigious offices: \"[[Caecina Decius Maximus Basilius|Basilius]], [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius|Decius]], [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Venantius]], and [[Manlius Boethius]] held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus|Symmachus]] and [[Rufius Achilius Sividius|Sividius]] were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.\"{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}} A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] acquired \"enhanced prestige and influence\" in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=253}} As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend ''S(enatus) C(onsulto)''. Jones describes these coins as \"fine big copper pieces\", which were \"a great improvement on the miserable little ''[[nummus|nummi]]'' hitherto current\", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=254}} \n\nAlthough Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], his relations with the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian church hierarchy]] were remarkably good. As G.M. Cook notes in her introduction to [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]]' ''Life of Saint Epiphanius'', he showed great esteem for Bishop [[Epiphanius of Pavia|Epiphanius]]: in response to the bishop's petition, Odoacer granted the inhabitants of [[Liguria]] a five-year immunity from taxes, and again granted his requests for relief from abuses by the [[praetorian prefect]].{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}{{efn|Cook writes, \"One wonders at [Ennodius'] brevity,\" adding that during \"the thirteen years of Odovacar's mastery of Italy... a period which embraced nearly half the episcopate of Epiphanius\u2014Ennodius devotes but eight sections of the ''vita'' (101\u2013107), five of which are taken up with the restoration of the churches.\" Cook uses Ennodius' brevity as an ''[[argumentum ex silentio]]'' to prove that Odoacer was very supportive of the Church. \"Ennodius was a loyal supporter of Theodoric the Great. Any oppression, therefore, on the part of Odovacar would not be passed over in silence.\" She concludes that Ennodius' silence \"may be construed as an unintentional tribute to the moderation and tolerance of the barbarian king.\"{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}}} The biography of Pope [[Felix III]] in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' openly states that the pontiff's tenure occurred during Odoacer's reign without any complaints about the king being registered.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=41fn}}\n\nIn 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the [[Rugians]] in [[Noricum]], taking their king [[Feletheus]] into captivity; when word that Feletheus' son, [[Frideric|Fredericus]], had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother [[Onoulphus]] with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy.{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=121}} The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the [[Lombards]] by 493.{{sfn|Paul the Deacon|2003|pp=31\u201333 [XIX]}}\n\n==Fall and death==\nAs Odoacer's position improved, [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival.

Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 152.}} Switching allegiances, Zeno subsequently sought to destroy Odoacer and then promised [[Theodoric the Great]] and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. As both [[Herwig Wolfram]] and Peter Heather point out, Theodoric had his own reasons to agree to this offer: \"Theodoric had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theodoric rebelled in 485, we are told, he had in mind Zeno's treatment of [[Armatus]]. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.\"{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=217}} \n\nIn 489, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the [[Julian Alps]] and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer [[Battle of Isonzo (489)|met him]] at the [[Isonzo]], only to be defeated.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=50\u201351}}{{efn|For several years the armies of Odoacer and Theodoric marched back and forth as they vied for control of Italy.{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1990|p=289}}}} He withdrew to [[Verona]], reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp. Theodoric followed him and three days later [[Battle of Verona (489)|defeated]] him again.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=51}}{{efn|See also: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 11.50f. This follows how Thomas Hodgkins explains this confusing chronology of the ''Anonymus Valesianus''; ''Italy and her Invaders'' (Oxford, 1885), vol. 4 p. 214.}} While Odoacer took refuge in [[Ravenna]], Theodoric continued across Italy to [[Mediolanum]], where the majority of Odoacer's army, including his chief general [[Tufa (general)|Tufa]], surrendered to the Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=337}}{{efn|Also See:''Anonymus Valesianus'', 11.52.}} Theodoric had no reason to doubt Tufa's loyalty and dispatched his new general to Ravenna with a band of elite soldiers. Herwig Wolfram observes, \"[b]ut Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theodoric suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Theodoric recoiled by seeking safety in [[Ticinum]]. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the [[Burgundians]] seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated [[Liguria]]. Many Romans were taken into captivity, and did not regain their freedom until Theodoric ransomed them three years later.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}}\n\nThe following summer, the Visigothic king [[Alaric II]] demonstrated what Wolfram calls \"one of the rare displays of Gothic solidarity\" and sent military aid to help his kinsman, forcing Odoacer to raise his siege. Theodoric emerged from Ticinum, and on 11 August 490, the armies of the two kings [[Battle of the Adda River|clashed]] on the [[Adda River]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Odoacer again was defeated and forced back into Ravenna, where Theodoric [[Siege of Ravenna (490\u2013493)|besieged]] him.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} Ravenna proved to be invulnerable, surrounded by marshes and estuaries and easily supplied by small boats from its hinterlands, as Procopius later pointed out in his ''History''.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|pp=252\u2013253 [5.1.18\u201323]}} Further, Tufa remained at large in the strategic valley of the [[Adige]] near [[Trento|Trent]], and received unexpected reinforcements when dissent amongst Theodoric's ranks led to sizable desertions.{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=219}} That same year, the [[Vandals]] took their turn to strike while both sides were fully engaged and invaded Sicily.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} While Theodoric was engaged with them, his ally Fredericus, king of the Rugians, began to oppress the inhabitants of [[Pavia]], whom the latter's forces had been garrisoned to protect. Once Theodoric intervened in person in late August, 491, his punitive acts drove Fredericus to desert with his followers to Tufa.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}{{efn|Wolfram suggests that sometime in 492 or 493, Fredericus and Tufa quarreled and fought a battle, during which both were killed. To this Wolfram adds, that the Rugians \"rejoined the Gothic king\" (by whom, he means Theodoric).{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}}}\n\nBy this time, however, Odoacer had to have lost all hope of victory. A large-scale sortie he sent out of Ravenna on the night of 9/10 July 491 ended in failure,{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=188}} during which his commander-in-chief, Livilia, along with the best of his Herulian soldiers were killed.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at [[Rimini]] to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theodoric and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theodoric entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theodoric while they shared a meal.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} Theodoric had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] \"Ad Laurentum\" (\"At the Laurel Grove\"); when this plan went astray, Theodoric drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, \"Where is God?\" Theodoric cried, \"This is what you did to my friends.\" Theodoric was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, \"The man has no bones in his body.\"{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=69}}{{efn|John of Antioch, fragment 214a; translated by C. D. Gordon, reports the statement as, \"There certainly wasn't a bone in this wretched fellow.\" ''Age of Attila'', pp. 182f. Both the ''Anonymus Valesianus'' (11.55) and [[Andreas Agnellus]] (''Liber pontificalis ecclesiae Ravennatis'', ch. 39) places the murder in Ad Laurentum. Herwig Wolfram explains Theodoric's claim of avenging his \"friends\" as recompense for the death of a Rugian royal couple\u2014\"it apparently did not matter that their son was at that very moment in open rebellion against Theodoric.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}}}}\n\nNot only did Theodoric slay Odoacer, he thereafter had the betrayed king's loyal followers hunted down and killed as well, an event which left him as the master of Italy.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=287}}{{efn|According to one account, \"That same day, all of Odoacer's army who could be found anywhere were killed by order of Theodoric, as well as all of his family.\"{{efn|See:Anonymus Valesianus'' 11.56}}}} Odoacer's wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church.

Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally seen as marking the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|end of the Western Roman Empire]].{{efn|\"Odoacer was the first barbarian who reigned over Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind.\" [[Edward Gibbon]], ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter XXXVI.{{sfn|Gibbon|1998|p=716}}}}\n\nThough the real power in [[Italy]] was in his hands, he represented himself as the [[patronage in ancient Rome|client]] of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor|emperor in Constantinople]], [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. Odoacer generally used the Roman honorific ''patrician,'' granted by the Zeno at the time, but was referred to as a king ({{lang-la|rex}}) in many documents. He himself used it in the only surviving official document that emanated from his chancery, and it was also used by the [[consul]] [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Basilius]].{{sfn|Martindale|1980|p=791\u2013793}}{{efn|[[Marcellinus Comes|Marcellinus]], [[Cassiodorus]], and some [[Papal]] documents, which come the closest to implying official use of the title, all refer to him as ''rex'' (or one of its declensions). [[Jordanes]] at one point refers to him as ''Gothorum Romanorumque regnator'': ruler of the Goths and the Romans. He is called an ''autokrator'' (autocrat) and a ''tyrannos'' (usurper, tyrant) in [[Procopius]]' ''Bellum Gothicum''. The only reference to Odoacer as \"King of Italy\" is in [[Victor Vitensis]]: ''Odouacro Italiae regi''.}} Odoacer introduced few important changes into the administrative system of Italy. He had the support of the [[Roman Senate]] and was able to distribute land to his followers without much opposition. Unrest among his warriors led to violence in 477\u2013478, but no such disturbances occurred during the later period of his reign. Although Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], he rarely intervened in the affairs of the [[Trinitarian]] [[state church of the Roman Empire]].<!-- explained below in the article; a cite here should not be necessary -->\n\nLikely of [[East Germanic]] descent, Odoacer was a military leader in Italy who led the revolt of [[Heruli]]an, [[Rugians|Rugian]], and [[Scirian]] soldiers that deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]] on 4 September AD 476. Augustulus had been declared Western Roman Emperor by his father, the rebellious general of the army in Italy, less than a year before, but had been unable to gain allegiance or recognition beyond central Italy. With the backing of the Roman Senate, Odoacer thenceforth ruled Italy autonomously, paying lip service to the authority of [[Julius Nepos]], the previous Western emperor, and Zeno, the emperor of the East. Upon Nepos's murder in 480 Odoacer invaded [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], to punish the murderers. He did so, executing the conspirators, but within two years also conquered the region and incorporated it into his domain.\n\nWhen [[Illus]], master of soldiers of the Eastern Empire, asked for Odoacer's help in 484 in his struggle to depose Zeno, Odoacer invaded Zeno's westernmost provinces. The emperor responded first by inciting the [[Rugii]] of present-day [[Austria]] to attack [[Italy]]. During the winter of 487\u2013488 Odoacer crossed the [[Danube]] and defeated the Rugii in their own territory. Zeno also appointed the [[Ostrogothic|Ostrogoth]] [[Theodoric the Great]] who was menacing the borders of the Eastern Empire, to be king of Italy, turning one troublesome, nominal vassal against another.  Theodoric invaded Italy in 489 and by August 490 had captured almost the entire peninsula, forcing Odoacer to take refuge in [[Ravenna]]. The city surrendered on 5 March 493; Theodoric invited Odoacer to a banquet of reconciliation and instead of forging an alliance, killed the unsuspecting king.\n\n==Ethnicity==\nExcept for the fact that he was not considered ''Roman'', Odoacer's precise ethnic origins are not known.{{efn|For more on this, see: Stefan Krautschick, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435971 \"Zwei Aspekte des Jahres 476\", ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte''], '''35''' (1986), pp. 344\u2013371.}} Most scholars consider him to be at least partly of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] descent. It can however be said that his family origins lie in the empire of [[Attila]].\n\n[[Jordanes]] associated him with several of the [[East Germanic]] tribes of the [[Middle Danube]] who had arrived there during the time of Attila's empire, including the [[Scirii]], [[Heruli]], and [[Rugii]]. In several passages he named him king of the [[Turcilingi]], which is a people, or perhaps a dynasty, that is mentioned by no other historical source. Modern historians also propose connections with [[Goths]], [[Huns]] or the [[Thuringii]]. While in one passage in his ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the [[Turcilingi]] (''Torcilingorum rex'') with Scirii and Heruli followers.{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}}, in another passage (LVII.291) he mentions Italy during Odoacer's reign being under the tyranny of Turcilingi and Rogii. In his ''[[Romana (Jordanes)|Romana]]'', the same author defines Odoacer as a descendant of the [[Rugii]] (or of a person named Rogus, ''Odoacer genere Rogus'') with Turcilingi, Rugian and Heruli followers.{{efn|See:Jordanes, ''Romana'' 344.}} It has been pointed out that Attila had an uncle of the name Rogus and suggested that Odoacer may have been seen as his descendant.{{sfn|Reynolds|1946|p=44}}\n\nIn a fragment from a history of [[Priscus]], reproduced by [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], Odoacer is described as a man of the Scirii, the son of Edeco, and brother of [[Onoulphus|Hunuulf]] who killed [[Armatus]] in the eastern Roman empire.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=98\u201399}} However, it is unclear whether this Edeko is identical to one\u2014or both\u2014men of the same name who lived at this time: one was an ambassador of [[Attila]] to the court in [[Constantinople]], and escorted [[Priscus]] and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp. He was described by Priscus as a Hun. The other is mentioned by [[Jordanes]] as a leader of the [[Scirii]], along with Hunuulf (perhaps his son) who were soundly defeated by the Ostrogoths at the [[Battle of Bolia]] in [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]] about 469. {{efn|See: Priscus, fragments 7 and 8, translated by C.D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), pp. 70\u201393}} \n\nThe ''[[Anonymus Valesianus]]'' agrees that his father's name was [[Edeko]] (Edika), and refers to him leading Scirii and Heruli. \n\n[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] calls him a [[Goths|Goth]].{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=284}} The sixth-century chronicler, [[Marcellinus Comes]], calls him \"the king of the Goths\" (''Odoacer rex Gothorum''). {{efn|Marcellinus Comes, ''Chronicon'', s. a. 476.}}\n\nMedieval scholar, Michael Frasetto, reports that Odoacer was of Scirian heritage,{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}} as do others;{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=699}} while historian, Erik Jensen, avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father, Edeco, was a [[Hun]].{{sfn|Jensen|2018|p=16}}\n\nAfter reviewing the primary sources, Bruce Macbain argues that \"The ancient sources exhibit considerable confusion over Odovacer's tribal affiliation, identifying him variously as a Skirian, a Rogian and/or Torcilingian, a Herul, and even a Goth;\" he subsequently concludes that \"not a single source calls him a Hun.\"{{sfn|Macbain|1983|p=325}} Historian Penny MacGeorge points out that the confusion about Odoacer's ethnicity is exaggerated and that the claims he was a Hun \"can almost certainly be dismissed;\" she asserts instead that Odoacer was \"surely Germanic.\"{{sfn|MacGeorge|2002|p=286}}\n\n===Onomastic evidence===\nThe origin of the name Odoacer, which may give indications as to his tribal affiliation, is debated. One suggestion is that Odoacer is derived from the Germanic ''[[Audawakrs|*Audawakraz]]'' (Gothic ''*Audawakrs''), from ''aud-'' \"wealth\" and ''wakr-'' \"vigilant\" or combined, \"watcher of the wealth.\"{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=699}} This form finds a cognate in another Germanic language, the titular ''Eadwacer'' of the Old English poem ''[[Wulf and Eadwacer]]'' (where Old English renders the earlier Germanic sound ''au-'' as ''ea-'').{{sfn|Voyles|1992|p=141}} On the other hand, historians Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez explored the possibility that the name Odoacer was not Germanic, making several arguments that his ethnic background might lie elsewhere. One of these is that his name, \"Odoacer\", for which an etymology in Germanic languages had not been convincingly found, could be a form of the [[Turkic languages|Turkish]] \"Ot-toghar\" (\"grass-born\" or \"fire-born\"), or the shorter form \"Ot-ghar\" (\"herder\").{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}}\n\n== Before Italy ==\nPossibly the earliest recorded incident involving Odoacer is from a fragment of a chronicle preserved in the ''Decem Libri Historiarum'' of [[Gregory of Tours]]. Two chapters of his work recount, in a confused or confusing manner, a number of battles fought by King [[Childeric I]] of the Franks, [[Aegidius]], Count Paul, and one \"[[Adovacrius]]\" or \"Odovacrius\".{{sfn|Gregory of Tours|1974|p=132 [II.18\u201319]}} If this is an account of Aegidius' victory over the [[Visigoths]], otherwise known from the ''Chronicle'' of [[Hydatius]], then this occurred in 463. Reynolds and Lopez, in their article mentioned above, suggested that this \"Adovacrius\" or \"Odovacrius\" may be the same person as the future king of Italy.{{sfn|Reynolds|Lopez|1946|p=45}} \n\nThe first certain act recorded for Odoacer was shortly before he arrived in Italy. [[Eugippius]], in his ''Life of Saint Severinus'', records how a group of barbarians on their way to Italy had stopped to pay their respects to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time \"a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes\", learned from [[Severinus of Noricum|Severinus]] that he would one day become famous.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} Despite that Odoacer was an Arian Christian and Severinus was Catholic, the latter left a deep impression on him.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|p=63}} When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: \"Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.\"{{sfn|Eugippius|1965|p=64}}{{efn|Bieler explains in a footnote that \"make rich gifts to many\" refers to the custom of Germanic war leaders giving lavishly to their followers, because \"generosity was one of the virtues which a king was supposed to have.\"}}\n\n==Leader of the ''foederati''==\nBy 470, Odoacer had become an officer in what remained of the Roman Army. Although Jordanes writes of Odoacer as invading Italy \"as leader of the Sciri, the [[Heruli]] and allies of various races\",{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.242]}} modern writers describe him as being part of the Roman military establishment, based on [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]]'s statement that Odoacer was on the side of [[Ricimer]] at the beginning of his battle with the emperor [[Anthemius]] in 472.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=275}}{{efn|Also See: John of Antioch, fragment 209; translated by C. D. Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 122.

Under the command of Orestes were significant contingents of Germanic peoples made up mostly of Rugii and Heruli tribesmen.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Before the end of that year Orestes had rebelled and driven Nepos from Italy.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2009|p=367}} Orestes then proclaimed his young son Romulus the new emperor as [[Romulus Augustulus|Romulus Augustus, called \"Augustulus\"]] (31 October).{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=405}} At this time, Odoacer was a soldier rising through the ranks.{{sfn|Thompson|1982|pp=63\u201364}} However, Nepos reorganized his court in [[Salona]], Dalmatia and received homage and affirmation from the remaining fragments of the Western Empire beyond Italy and, most importantly, from Constantinople, which refused to accept Augustulus, Zeno having branded him and his father as traitors and usurpers.{{sfn|Bury|1958|p=190}}\n\nAbout this time the ''foederati'', who had been quartered in Italy all of these years, had grown weary of this arrangement. In the words of [[J. B. Bury]], \"They desired to have roof-trees and lands of their own, and they petitioned Orestes to reward them for their services, by granting them lands and settling them permanently in Italy\".{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} Orestes refused their petition, and they turned to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] along with his brother Paulus outside [[Ravenna]]. The Germanic ''foederati,'' the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer ''rex Italiae'' (\"king of Italy\").{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=406}} In 476 Odoacer advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on 4 September. According to the ''Anonymus Valesianus'', Odoacer was moved by Romulus's youth and his beauty to not only spare his life but give him a pension of 6,000 ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'' and sent him to [[Campania]] to live with his relatives.{{sfn|Bernard|1970|p=19}}{{efn|Also see: ''Anonymus Valesianus'', 8.38.

The message was clear: the West no longer required a separate Emperor, for \"one monarch sufficed [to rule] the world\". In response, Zeno accepted their gifts and this essentially brought to end any puppet emperors in the West, with Nepos banished and Anthemius dead.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=407}} The Eastern Emperor then conferred upon Odoacer the title of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] and granted him legal authority to govern Italy in the name of Rome.{{sfn|Heather|2005|pp=428\u2013429}} Zeno also suggested that Odoacer should receive Nepos back as Emperor in the West,{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=429}} \"if he truly wished to act with justice.\"{{efn|See:Malchus, fragment 10, translated in C. D. Gordon, ''The Age of Attila'', pp. 127\u2013129.}} Although he accepted the title of Patrician from Zeno, Odoacer did not invite Julius Nepos to return to Rome, and the latter remained in Dalmatia until his death. Odoacer was careful to observe form, however, and made a pretence of acting on Nepos's authority, even issuing coins with both his image and that of Zeno.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=219}} Following Nepos's murder in 480, who was killed while waiting in Dalmatia,{{sfn|Bunson|1995|p=292}} Zeno became sole Emperor.{{sfn|Grant|1998|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nBury, however, disagrees that Odoacer's assumption of power marked the fall of the Roman Empire:\n{{bquote|It stands out prominently as an important stage in the process of the dismemberment of the Empire.

In A.D. 476 the same principle of disintegration was first applied to Italy. The settlement of Odovacar's East Germans, with Zeno's acquiescence, began the process by which Italian soil was to pass into the hands of Ostrogoths and [[Lombards]], [[Franks]] and [[Normans]].

According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he \"slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=119 [XLVI.243]}} He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighboring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]] to cede Sicily to him. Noting that \"Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November\", F.M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476.{{sfn|Clover|1999|p=237}} When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=410}}\n\nAs Bury points out, \"It is highly important to observe that Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.\" He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the [[Consul]]ate and other prestigious offices: \"[[Caecina Decius Maximus Basilius|Basilius]], [[Caecina Mavortius Basilius Decius|Decius]], [[Decius Marius Venantius Basilius|Venantius]], and [[Manlius Boethius]] held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus|Symmachus]] and [[Rufius Achilius Sividius|Sividius]] were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.\"{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=409}} A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] acquired \"enhanced prestige and influence\" in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=253}} As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend ''S(enatus) C(onsulto)''. Jones describes these coins as \"fine big copper pieces\", which were \"a great improvement on the miserable little ''[[nummus|nummi]]'' hitherto current\", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]] in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=254}} \n\nAlthough Odoacer was an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]], his relations with the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian church hierarchy]] were remarkably good. As G.M. Cook notes in her introduction to [[Magnus Felix Ennodius]]' ''Life of Saint Epiphanius'', he showed great esteem for Bishop [[Epiphanius of Pavia|Epiphanius]]: in response to the bishop's petition, Odoacer granted the inhabitants of [[Liguria]] a five-year immunity from taxes, and again granted his requests for relief from abuses by the [[praetorian prefect]].{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}{{efn|Cook writes, \"One wonders at [Ennodius'] brevity,\" adding that during \"the thirteen years of Odovacar's mastery of Italy... a period which embraced nearly half the episcopate of Epiphanius\u2014Ennodius devotes but eight sections of the ''vita'' (101\u2013107), five of which are taken up with the restoration of the churches.\" Cook uses Ennodius' brevity as an ''[[argumentum ex silentio]]'' to prove that Odoacer was very supportive of the Church. \"Ennodius was a loyal supporter of Theodoric the Great. Any oppression, therefore, on the part of Odovacar would not be passed over in silence.\" She concludes that Ennodius' silence \"may be construed as an unintentional tribute to the moderation and tolerance of the barbarian king.\"{{sfn|Ennodius|1942|p=12fn}}}} The biography of Pope [[Felix III]] in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' openly states that the pontiff's tenure occurred during Odoacer's reign without any complaints about the king being registered.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=41fn}}\n\nIn 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the [[Rugians]] in [[Noricum]], taking their king [[Feletheus]] into captivity; when word that Feletheus' son, [[Frideric|Fredericus]], had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother [[Onoulphus]] with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy.{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=121}} The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the [[Lombards]] by 493.{{sfn|Paul the Deacon|2003|pp=31\u201333 [XIX]}}\n\n==Fall and death==\nAs Odoacer's position improved, [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival.

Gordon, ''Age of Attila'', p. 152.}} Switching allegiances, Zeno subsequently sought to destroy Odoacer and then promised [[Theodoric the Great]] and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. As both [[Herwig Wolfram]] and Peter Heather point out, Theodoric had his own reasons to agree to this offer: \"Theodoric had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theodoric rebelled in 485, we are told, he had in mind Zeno's treatment of [[Armatus]]. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.\"{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=217}} \n\nIn 489, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the [[Julian Alps]] and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer [[Battle of Isonzo (489)|met him]] at the [[Isonzo]], only to be defeated.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=50\u201351}}{{efn|For several years the armies of Odoacer and Theodoric marched back and forth as they vied for control of Italy.{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1990|p=289}}}} He withdrew to [[Verona]], reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp.

Herwig Wolfram observes, \"[b]ut Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theodoric suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Theodoric recoiled by seeking safety in [[Ticinum]]. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the [[Burgundians]] seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated [[Liguria]]. Many Romans were taken into captivity, and did not regain their freedom until Theodoric ransomed them three years later.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}}\n\nThe following summer, the Visigothic king [[Alaric II]] demonstrated what Wolfram calls \"one of the rare displays of Gothic solidarity\" and sent military aid to help his kinsman, forcing Odoacer to raise his siege. Theodoric emerged from Ticinum, and on 11 August 490, the armies of the two kings [[Battle of the Adda River|clashed]] on the [[Adda River]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=281}} Odoacer again was defeated and forced back into Ravenna, where Theodoric [[Siege of Ravenna (490\u2013493)|besieged]] him.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} Ravenna proved to be invulnerable, surrounded by marshes and estuaries and easily supplied by small boats from its hinterlands, as Procopius later pointed out in his ''History''.{{sfn|Prokopios|2014|pp=252\u2013253 [5.1.18\u201323]}} Further, Tufa remained at large in the strategic valley of the [[Adige]] near [[Trento|Trent]], and received unexpected reinforcements when dissent amongst Theodoric's ranks led to sizable desertions.{{sfn|Heather|1996|p=219}} That same year, the [[Vandals]] took their turn to strike while both sides were fully engaged and invaded Sicily.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}} While Theodoric was engaged with them, his ally Fredericus, king of the Rugians, began to oppress the inhabitants of [[Pavia]], whom the latter's forces had been garrisoned to protect. Once Theodoric intervened in person in late August, 491, his punitive acts drove Fredericus to desert with his followers to Tufa.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}{{efn|Wolfram suggests that sometime in 492 or 493, Fredericus and Tufa quarreled and fought a battle, during which both were killed. To this Wolfram adds, that the Rugians \"rejoined the Gothic king\" (by whom, he means Theodoric).{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=282}}}}\n\nBy this time, however, Odoacer had to have lost all hope of victory. A large-scale sortie he sent out of Ravenna on the night of 9/10 July 491 ended in failure,{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=188}} during which his commander-in-chief, Livilia, along with the best of his Herulian soldiers were killed.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at [[Rimini]] to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theodoric and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theodoric entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theodoric while they shared a meal.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=283}} Theodoric had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] \"Ad Laurentum\" (\"At the Laurel Grove\"); when this plan went astray, Theodoric drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, \"Where is God?\" Theodoric cried, \"This is what you did to my friends.\" Theodoric was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, \"The man has no bones in his body.\"{{sfn|Amory|1997|p=69}}{{efn|John of Antioch, fragment 214a; translated by C.

In April 2019, they stated that \"there is no added benefit to declaring a PHEIC at this stage\", a notion that is not part of the PHEIC criteria laid down in the IHR.<ref name=\"Kamradt-Scott2019\" /><ref name=\"Lancet2019\">{{Cite journal|last=Lancet|first=The|date=25 May 2019|title=Acknowledging the limits of public health solutions|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31183-3/abstract|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=393|issue=10186|pages=2100|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31183-3|issn=0140-6736|pmid=31226033}}</ref>\n\nAfter confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, [[Tedros Adhanom]], the Director-General of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC.<ref name=\"Hunt2019\">{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/12/health/ebola-outbreak-death-uganda-africa-intl-bn/index.html|title=Ebola outbreak enters 'truly frightening phase' as it turns deadly in Uganda|last=Hunt|first=Katie|website=CNN|language=en|accessdate=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes14June2019\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/world/africa/ebola-uganda-congo.html|title=Boy, 5, and Grandmother Die in Uganda as More Ebola Cases Emerge|last=Gladstone|first=Rick|date=12 June 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=14 June 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) and the region, it does not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC.<ref name=\"WHO14June2019\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-06-2019-statement-on-the-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-for-ebola-virus-disease-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo|title=Statement on the meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 14 June 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 June 2019}}</ref> Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHIEC was that the overall risk of international spread was deemed to be low, and the risk of damaging the economy of the DRC high.<ref name=\"SoucharyJune2019\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/ebola-case-counts-spike-again-drc|title=Ebola case counts spike again in DRC|last=Souchary|first=Stephanie|date=17 June 2019|website=CIDRAP|language=en|access-date=24 June 2019}}</ref> Adhanom also stated that declaring a PHEIC would be an inappropriate way to raise money for the epidemic.<ref name=\"CIDRAP16July2019\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/who-will-take-ebola-emergency-declaration-question-fourth-time|title=WHO will take up Ebola emergency declaration question for a fourth time|last=Soucheray|first=Stephanie|last2=2019|date=16 July 2019|website=CIDRAP|language=en|access-date=17 July 2019}}</ref> Following a visit to the DRC in July 2019, [[Rory Stewart]], the UK's [[Department for International Development|DfID]] minister, called for the WHO to declare it an emergency.<ref name=\"Wintour9July2019\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/07/declare-ebola-outbreak-in-drc-an-emergency-says-uks-rory-stewart|title=Declare Ebola outbreak in DRC an emergency, says UK's Rory Stewart|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|date=7 July 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 July 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nAcknowledging a high risk of spread to the capital of North Kivu, [[Goma]], a call for a PHEIC declaration was published on 10 July 2019 in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' by [[Daniel R.

Income from Brafferton Manor in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], designated for charitable and pious purposes, was used to \"civilize\" Indian youth, prepare them for Anglican priesthood \u2014 and produce interpreters and cultural liaisons who could aid Britain's colonial expansion. The undertaking of producing Indian ministers met with little success, except among the Pamunkey. Virginia's efforts to encourage allied and neighboring tribes to send Indian youth to Williamsburg were more successful, and several Brafferton students were key players in the late eighteenth century wars of North America. However, during the [[American Revolution]], income from the Boyle estate was interrupted, and the teenage students mostly engaged in the conflict, the last leaving during the fall of 1778. Boyle monies were reinvested in the College following the Revolution, but discontinued after 1784, partially as a result of a lengthy court case involving the trustees of the Boyle Charity and the College of William & Mary. After the College lost the chancery case, the Indian school was abandoned, and the Boyle money was redirecting to the Caribbean, and still later, to Canada.  \n\nThe Brafferton was damaged during the [[American Civil War]] and the College spent $3,000 for repairs. Throughout the years, the building served as a residence for professors, a dormitory for students, an armory for the Wise Light Infantry, and an alumni office.  Additionally, it has temporarily housed other offices, fine arts classes, and even the Music Department for a short period of time.  Since 1985, the Brafferton has housed the offices of the president and the provost of the College. At the request of the Governor's advisory Council on Indians, a state historical marker was erected on the Brafferton grounds in 2005.\n\nThe building was first refurbished in 1930-31 during the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg. It received additional renovation in 2010\u201313, a period in which the College of William & Mary established the Brafferton Legacy Group in conjunction with alumni from the school's tribal descendant communities, the Department of Anthropology, the College's American Indian Resource Center, Colonial Williamsburg's (CW) Department of Archaeology, and CW's American Indian Initiative. The College and CW hosted a ground blessing for the start of archaeological investigations at the Indian school, and several Pamunkey tribal members worked on the 2011-12 excavations. The building was rededicated in 2013 with opening remarks in the Cherokee language and honor songs, alongside greetings from the President of William & Mary and College Provost.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* University Archives Buildings File (2007).

Income from Brafferton Manor in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], designated for charitable and pious purposes, was used to \"civilize\" Indian youth, prepare them for Anglican priesthood \u2014 and produce interpreters and cultural liaisons who could aid Britain's colonial expansion. The undertaking of producing Indian ministers met with little success, except among the Pamunkey. Virginia's efforts to encourage allied and neighboring tribes to send Indian youth to Williamsburg were more successful, and several Brafferton students were key players in the late eighteenth century wars of North America. However, during the [[American Revolution]], income from the Boyle estate was interrupted, and the teenage students mostly engaged in the conflict, the last leaving during the fall of 1778. Boyle monies were reinvested in the College following the Revolution, but discontinued after 1784, partially as a result of a lengthy court case involving the trustees of the Boyle Charity and the College of William & Mary. After the College lost the chancery case, the Indian school was abandoned, and the Boyle money was redirecting to the Caribbean, and still later, to Canada.  \n\nThe Brafferton was damaged during the [[American Civil War]] and the College spent $3,000 for repairs. Throughout the years, the building served as a residence for professors, a dormitory for students, an armory for the Wise Light Infantry, and an alumni office.  Additionally, it has temporarily housed other offices, fine arts classes, and even the Music Department for a short period of time.  Since 1985, the Brafferton has housed the offices of the president and the provost of the College. At the request of the Governor's advisory Council on Indians, a state historical marker was erected on the Brafferton grounds in 2005.\n\nThe building was first refurbished in 1930-31 during the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg. It received additional renovation in 2010-13, a period in which the College of William & Mary established the Brafferton Legacy Group in conjunction with alumni from the school's tribal descendant communities, the Department of Anthropology, the College's American Indian Resource Center, Colonial Williamsburg's (CW) Department of Archaeology, and CW's American Indian Initiative. The College and CW hosted a ground blessing for the start of archaeological investigations at the Indian school, and several Pamunkey tribal members worked on the 2011-12 excavations. The building was rededicated in 2013 with opening remarks in the Cherokee language and honor songs, alongside greetings from the President of William & Mary and College Provost.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* University Archives Buildings File (2007).

The school also co-founded the China Cup and Tri-Cities competitions. SAS students also participate in the [[China International Schools Sports Association]] (CISSA) League.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n\n'''Early Decades'''\n\nSAS opened on September 17, 1912 with 38 students and a two-building campus in Shanghai's Hongkou neighborhood, north of the Bund. The school was originally intended to serve \"the children of American missionaries and other European residents in the East\" but quickly established a reputation for academic excellence, and within a decade, the campus had grown to include twelve buildings on or near North Sichuan Road. With the support of the American business community in Shanghai and abroad, SAS broke ground on a purpose-built campus located amid farmland on the western edge of \"Frenchtown\" (today's former [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amcham-shanghai.org/our-history|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=13 December 2017|website=Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce|access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, SAS moved to a new campus located on Avenue Petain (now [[Hengshan Road]]), whose administration building was modeled after Philadelphia's Independence Hall. (It can still be seen along Hengshan Road; the Girl's Dormitory and Water Tower also remain but are not visible from the road.)\n\nOver the next two decades, SAS's fortunes echoed those of its host city of Shanghai \u2013 from the prosperous days of the mid-\u201820s and \u201830s to the challenging times of war in 1927, 1932, and 1937.\n\nIn 1941, faced with a declining foreign population and with a world war growing in scope, the SAS Board of Managers made the decision to close the school.\n\n'''Bootleg SAS'''\n\nUpon hearing of the Board\u2019s decision, a SAS teacher named Frank \"Unk\" Cheney declared the school must go on. He gathered remaining faculty, staff, and equipment and continued SAS under a series of different names. He called them \"Bootleg SAS.\"\n\nBootleg SAS operated out of the SAS campus on Hengshan Road, as well as in the Community Church across the street (still an active church at 53 Hengshan Road). In 1943, Cheney and most of the SAS population were forced into [[Chapei Civilian Assembly Camp]], a Japanese-run internment camp. Still not content to see the school cease operations, Cheney packed thousands of books and brought them to internment camp so school could go on. Housed in an open-air shed with the most rudimentary supplies, the newest iteration of Bootleg SAS nevertheless opened with 222 students. At the end of World War II, the SAS Board of Managers vowed to re-open SAS in the fall of 1946. Unwilling to wait an additional year, Cheney opened yet another Bootleg SAS in the fall of 1945 to serve students until SAS could officially open the following fall.\n\n'''Post-WWII'''\n\nAt SAS, the period of 1946-49 saw the return of old traditions, sports and arts programs. The school and its campus were even featured in LIFE magazine. But by 1949, with China at the end of a civil war and Shanghai about to be invaded by the Communist Party, the SAS Board of Managers once again made the decision to close the school.\n\nWith Unk Cheney no longer on staff, a vice principal named Val Sundt was inspired to invoke the \"Spirit of Cheney\" and assure the school would once again continue.\n\nSundt founded the final Bootleg SAS in 1949\u201350, called Private American School. At the conclusion of the school year in May 1950, Sundt closed the school's doors, and the remaining SAS teachers and students heeded the warnings of the U.S. State Department and departed Shanghai.\n\n'''The Re-founding'''\n\nIn January 1980, encouraged by the reformist efforts of Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]], the U.S. re-established its Consulate in Shanghai. One of the Consulate's first employees, economics advisor Tom Lauer, brought his wife, Linnea, and three children to Shanghai. Recognizing a need to educate the children of Consulate employees, the U.S. State Department asked Mrs. Lauer to restart Shanghai American School.\n\nSAS re-opened on the U.S. Consulate grounds on [[Huaihai Road|Huai Hai Road]] in September 1980. It remained there until outgrowing the space in 1989.\n\nThe Shanghai Girls #3 School, one of Shanghai's most reputable schools, with an alumni list that includes China's famous [[Soong sisters]],{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} agreed to share space with SAS. With a booming foreign population coming into Shanghai, a SAS education was in heavy demand and in spite of building additional buildings and floors, it wasn't long before SAS had again outgrown its space.\n\n'''Pit Stop Campus Era'''\n\nBy the mid-1990s, SAS had decided to build not one but two purpose-built campuses \u2013 one on each side of Shanghai's Huangpu River. Before the campus construction could be completed, the school needed to move once again.\n\nThree temporary campuses were established. In Puxi, a semi-built cultural center in Zhudi Town was reassigned to the school. In Pudong, another cultural center \u2013 Huaxia \u2013 was selected to be SAS\u2019 first presence on the Pudong side of the Huangpu River. A third temporary campus was founded in the Shanghai Centre on Nanjing Road to serve the youngest SAS attendees, though it soon proved unnecessary and closed after just one semester.\n\nFacilities during this time in SAS history were makeshift at best. The school's swim team held competitions at Shanghai's Holiday Inn, and storefronts across from campus served as classrooms. Ignoring the challenges of the times, the school laid plans for a brighter future. SAS became a co-founder of the region's Asia Pacific Athletic Conference (APAC), in spite of having no athletics facilities at the time.\n\n'''Modern-day SAS'''\n\nIn 1998, the Pudong campus opened on the shores of the East China Sea. In 2000, the Puxi campus opened in the heart of the Minhang district. \n\nIn 2017, James Mikkelson, a veteran English teacher at the Puxi campus, was fired after being found in possession of pornography on his school computer and exchanging explicit messages with former students. He was also the subject of numerous sexual misconduct allegations.<ref>https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NzEzNjEwNA%3D%3D&mid=2247488096&idx=2&sn=d1c795c99807d42da2b1702623e12184&chksm=90a42ee7a7d3a7f1a21ef39b283d3678db916a9e3a4f5dd7db1199c278c345c8f373a167675f#rd</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of international schools in Shanghai]]\n* [[Americans in China]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.saschina.org/ Shanghai American School website]\n* [http://gsgi.co.uk/countries/china/shanghai/shanghai-american-school-sas?

More than 10,000 students gather to hear the history about [[The Stanford Axe]] and Big Game. The University of California Rally Committee is in charge of the planning and setting up the bonfire, as well as refueling it during the rally. Specifically, freshman members of the UC Rally Committee, as well as freshman band members are sent out with pallets to the chanting of \"freshmen, more wood.\" Several alumni show up to perform traditional rituals. A tradition unique to Cal is the performance of the [[Haka performed by non-New Zealand sports teams|Haka]], a traditional Maori war dance/chant. Traditionally performed by an alumni Yell Leader, the Haka performed was written in the 1960s by a [[California Golden Bears rugby|Cal rugby]] player of Maori descent. The traditional Axe Yell is also made and visits from the [[University of California Men's Octet|UC Men's Octet]] and [[California Golden Overtones|Golden Overtones]] are always expected.  The [[University of California Marching Band]] is also present, playing traditional Cal songs throughout the duration of the Rally. The highlight of the Rally is the lighting of Big Game Bonfire itself, with the fire reaching its zenith at over eight stories.\n\nThe Big Game Bonfire Rally always ends with the reciting of a speech known as the \"[[Andy Smith (American football)|Andy Smith]] Eulogy\" or \"The Spirit of California\". Written by Garff Wilson in remembrance of the fabled Cal football coach, who led the Bears to five straight undefeated seasons starting in 1919 before tragically dying of pneumonia in 1925, the speech closes the Rally annually since 1949.  During the speech, candles are passed out among the attendants and are lit for the singing of the campus alma mater, \"[[All Hail Blue and Gold]].\"<ref name=SFC-120730 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00221&toc.id=div00219 |title=Andy Smith Eulogy |author= |date= |publisher=University of California |website=Calisphere |accessdate=25 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the Big Game Bonfire Rally was moved to [[Edwards Stadium]] and the bonfire was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict with a [[Bob Dylan]] concert.

Kevin Moen, who was also the initial ball carrier, ran for a touchdown while knocking down the final Stanford \"defender,\" trombone player Gary Tyrrell, who had run onto the field with the rest of the band to celebrate prematurely.\n\nThe Play is often recounted with [[KGO-AM|KGO]] radio announcer [[Joe Starkey]]'s emotional call of The Play, which he hailed as \"the most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heartrending, exciting, thrilling finish in the history of college football!\" The legitimacy of The Play has remained controversial among some Stanford fans.  The final score in the official record shows Cal winning by a score of 25\u201320, whereas in many Stanford publications it is recorded as Stanford 20, Cal 19 due to Stanford's contention that a Cal ball carrier had his knee down and the last lateral was actually an illegal forward pass, either of which should have resulted in the end of the play. However, speculation will not erase the final result.\n\nIn 2007, as part of the buildup to The Play's 25th anniversary, the Bay Area News Group asked Verle Sorgen, the Pac-10 Conference's supervisor of instant replay, to review the two disputed laterals according to modern NCAA instant replay review rules. After watching enhanced footage on a modern, large-screen monitor, Sorgen opined that the fifth lateral from Ford to Moen \"was released at the 22 and touched at the 20-1/2. From that, it clearly appears forward.\" Asked for his \"ultimate call,\" Sorgen replied, \"I would be tempted to reverse it...then go out and get the motor running in my car.\"<ref>[https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/11/29/upon-further-review-the-play-wouldnt-result-in-cal-win/] Del Grande, Dave. \"Upon further review, The Play wouldn't result in Cal win.

When the ball was snapped, Stanford redshirt freshman Tuan Van Le raced from the left end of the defensive line to block the kick and preserve a 19\u201319 tie. As Stanford was the holder of the Axe going into the game, the tie meant the Axe returned to the Farm for another year. The result was celebrated in the stadium as a victory by Stanford as the Axe was paraded by the Stanford Axe Committee and football players before jubilant Cardinal fans, with stunned Bears fans looking on.

After Cal's punt, Stanford took its final possession on its own 13 with 1:54 left.  Escaping two near interceptions and converting a 4th and 6, Stanford moved the ball to the Cal 19 with 0:17 left.  Quarterback [[Jason Palumbis]] threw a touchdown pass to [[Ed McCaffrey]] in the end zone to make it 25\u201324.  With no overtime, and despite the fact that a tie would keep the Axe at Stanford for another year, Cardinal coach Dennis Green quickly went for a two-point conversion. Palumbis' pass into the end zone was intercepted by John Hardy and Cal fans and players engulfed the field, causing a lengthy delay and resulting in a 15-yard delay of game penalty. With 12 seconds left and now kicking from the 50 yard line, Hopkins bounced the ensuing [[onside kick]] off a Cal player and, after being touched by seven players, the ball was recovered by Stanford's Dan Byers on the Cal 37. With 9 seconds left and no time outs, a pass attempt to McCaffrey to set up a field goal fell short, but Palumbis was roughed on the play moving the ball to the 22 yard line. With 5 seconds left, Hopkins connected on a 39-yard field goal into the wind, giving Stanford a 27\u201325 victory as time expired.  This time Stanford students and players engulfed the field.  The late passing and kicking excitement overshadowed two excellent running performances by Cal's [[Russell White]] (177 yards and 2 TD's) and Stanford's [[Glyn Milburn]] (196 yards and 1 TD).  Milburn also led Stanford receiving with 9 receptions for 66 yards and had 117 return yards.  His 379 all-purpose yards set a Pac-10 record at the time and remained Stanford's record until it was eclipsed by [[Christian McCaffrey]]'s 389 all-purpose yards in the 2015 edition of the Big Game.<ref name=bg90>{{cite news|last=Peters|first=Keith| work =Palo Alto Weekly|date=November 19, 1997| title=Big Game Flashback|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/cover/1997_Nov_19.COVSIDE4.html| accessdate =November 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2000===\nStanford's [[Casey Moore]] caught the winning touchdown on the final play of the first-ever Big Game to go into [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]].<ref name=stanbg/>\n\n===2009===\nCal's Michael Mohamed intercepted an [[Andrew Luck]] pass at the Cal 3-yard line with 1:36 left to preserve a Cal win over #14 Stanford, 34\u201328.

More than 10,000 students gather to hear the history about [[The Stanford Axe]] and Big Game. The University of California Rally Committee is in charge of the planning and setting up the bonfire, as well as refueling it during the rally. Specifically, freshman members of the UC Rally Committee, as well as freshman band members are sent out with pallets to the chanting of \"freshmen, more wood.\" Several alumni show up to perform traditional rituals. A tradition unique to Cal is the performance of the [[Haka performed by non-New Zealand sports teams|Haka]], a traditional Maori war dance/chant. Traditionally performed by an alumni Yell Leader, the Haka performed was written in the 1960s by a [[California Golden Bears rugby|Cal rugby]] player of Maori descent. The traditional Axe Yell is also made and visits from the [[University of California Men's Octet|UC Men's Octet]] and [[California Golden Overtones|Golden Overtones]] are always expected.  The [[University of California Marching Band]] is also present, playing traditional Cal songs throughout the duration of the Rally. The highlight of the Rally is the lighting of Big Game Bonfire itself, with the fire reaching its zenith at over eight stories.\n\nThe Big Game Bonfire Rally always ends with the reciting of a speech known as the \"[[Andy Smith (American football)|Andy Smith]] Eulogy\" or \"The Spirit of California\". Written by Garff Wilson in remembrance of the fabled Cal football coach, who led the Bears to five straight undefeated seasons starting in 1919 before tragically dying of pneumonia in 1925, the speech closes the Rally annually since 1949.  During the speech, candles are passed out among the attendants and are lit for the singing of the campus alma mater, \"[[All Hail Blue and Gold]].\"<ref name=SFC-120730 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4v19n9zb;NAAN=13030&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00221&toc.id=div00219 |title=Andy Smith Eulogy |author= |date= |publisher=University of California |website=Calisphere |accessdate=25 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the Big Game Bonfire Rally was moved to [[Edwards Stadium]] and the bonfire was cancelled due to a scheduling conflict with a [[Bob Dylan]] concert.

Kevin Moen, who was also the initial ball carrier, ran for a touchdown while knocking down the final Stanford \"defender,\" trombone player Gary Tyrrell, who had run onto the field with the rest of the band to celebrate prematurely.\n\nThe Play is often recounted with [[KGO-AM|KGO]] radio announcer [[Joe Starkey]]'s emotional call of The Play, which he hailed as \"the most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heartrending, exciting, thrilling finish in the history of college football!\" The legitimacy of The Play has remained controversial among some Stanford fans.  The final score in the official record shows Cal winning by a score of 25\u201320, whereas in many Stanford publications it is recorded as Stanford 20, Cal 19 due to Stanford's contention that a Cal ball carrier had his knee down and the last lateral was actually an illegal forward pass, either of which should have resulted in the end of the play. However, speculation will not erase the final result.\n\nIn 2007, as part of the buildup to The Play's 25th anniversary, the Bay Area News Group asked Verle Sorgen, the Pac-10 Conference's supervisor of instant replay, to review the two disputed laterals according to modern NCAA instant replay review rules. After watching enhanced footage on a modern, large-screen monitor, Sorgen opined that the fifth lateral from Ford to Moen \"was released at the 22 and touched at the 20-1/2. From that, it clearly appears forward.\" Asked for his \"ultimate call,\" Sorgen replied, \"I would be tempted to reverse it...then go out and get the motor running in my car.\"<ref>[https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/11/29/upon-further-review-the-play-wouldnt-result-in-cal-win/] Del Grande, Dave. \"Upon further review, The Play wouldn't result in Cal win.

When the ball was snapped, Stanford redshirt freshman Tuan Van Le raced from the left end of the defensive line to block the kick and preserve a 19\u201319 tie. As Stanford was the holder of the Axe going into the game, the tie meant the Axe returned to the Farm for another year. The result was celebrated in the stadium as a victory by Stanford as the Axe was paraded by the Stanford Axe Committee and football players before jubilant Cardinal fans, with stunned Bears fans looking on.

After Cal's punt, Stanford took its final possession on its own 13 with 1:54 left.  Escaping two near interceptions and converting a 4th and 6, Stanford moved the ball to the Cal 19 with 0:17 left.  Quarterback [[Jason Palumbis]] threw a touchdown pass to [[Ed McCaffrey]] in the end zone to make it 25\u201324.  With no overtime, and despite the fact that a tie would keep the Axe at Stanford for another year, Cardinal coach Dennis Green quickly went for a two-point conversion. Palumbis' pass into the end zone was intercepted by John Hardy and Cal fans and players engulfed the field, causing a lengthy delay and resulting in a 15-yard delay of game penalty. With 12 seconds left and now kicking from the 50 yard line, Hopkins bounced the ensuing [[onside kick]] off a Cal player and, after being touched by seven players, the ball was recovered by Stanford's Dan Byers on the Cal 37. With 9 seconds left and no time outs, a pass attempt to McCaffrey to set up a field goal fell short, but Palumbis was roughed on the play moving the ball to the 22 yard line. With 5 seconds left, Hopkins connected on a 39-yard field goal into the wind, giving Stanford a 27\u201325 victory as time expired.  This time Stanford students and players engulfed the field.  The late passing and kicking excitement overshadowed two excellent running performances by Cal's [[Russell White]] (177 yards and 2 TD's) and Stanford's [[Glyn Milburn]] (196 yards and 1 TD).  Milburn also led Stanford receiving with 9 receptions for 66 yards and had 117 return yards.  His 379 all-purpose yards set a Pac-10 record at the time and remained Stanford's record until it was eclipsed by [[Christian McCaffrey]]'s 389 all-purpose yards in the 2015 edition of the Big Game.<ref name=bg90>{{cite news|last=Peters|first=Keith| work =Palo Alto Weekly|date=November 19, 1997| title=Big Game Flashback|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/cover/1997_Nov_19.COVSIDE4.html| accessdate =November 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2000===\nStanford's [[Casey Moore]] caught the winning touchdown on the final play of the first-ever Big Game to go into [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]].<ref name=stanbg/>\n\n===2009===\nCal's Michael Mohamed intercepted an [[Andrew Luck]] pass at the Cal 3-yard line with 1:36 left to preserve a Cal win over #14 Stanford, 34\u201328.
