{"title_page": "Parish close", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2015}}\n[[Image:Bretagne historique.png|thumb|360px|right|The historic dioceses of Brittany]]\n[[Image:Bretagne Finistere Guimiliau1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Entrance to the parish close at [[Guimiliau]], showing the enclosing wall and gateway]]\n'''Parish close''' is a translation of the French term ''enclos paroissial''. It refers to a number of locations in [[Brittany]], mainly though not exclusively in the historic diocese of L\u00e9on, corresponding roughly to the northern half of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Finist\u00e8re]]. These feature an elaborately decorated [[parish]] church surrounded by an entirely walled [[churchyard]], and date from the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\n==The term==\n\nThe term ''enclos paroissial'' seems self-explanatory, but can seem a false friend to the English, especially British English, reader. Cathedral closes are an important feature of urban architecture in Britain and it is easy to assume that a parish close is simply smaller but analogous. Cathedral closes include many residential and administrative buildings, as well as the church. Parish closes are entirely [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic]] in character. The walled churchyard surrounds only buildings and structures designed for worship \u2013 the church, the [[calvary]], and sometimes an [[ossuary]] or [[charnel house]].\n\n==Origins and history==\n\nThere is a tradition of sacred enclosures with marked boundaries ([[fanum]]) in [[Celtic polytheism]]. This reflected a pre-occupation with well-defined sacred features, particularly springs and groves. After the arrival of Christianity, many older traditions and cultural traits persisted within the new religion. The place-name element ''lan'' or ''llan'', now taken to signify a church, originally signified an enclosure. In all [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] Celtic areas, there was a strong association between church enclosures and specific saints, often of a very particular local character. Whatever the persistence of older themes and styles, the parish closes of Brittany took their present form in the early modern period, over a millennium after the region was thoroughly Christianized.\n\nA major factor in permitting the elaboration of parish closes was the relative prosperity of Finist\u00e8re in the 16th century. This was built on the maritime competition and constant warfare that plagued much of Western Europe in this period. A group of parishes, just inland, benefited hugely from supplying the ports with the [[hemp]] and [[linen]] needed to rig ships, as well as food, clothing, and other supplies. This allowed them to engage in friendly civic competition with each other, constructing and embellishing closes that were displayed most effectively during the periodic [[Pardon (ceremony)|pardons]], which attracted pilgrims from all over Brittany and beyond.\n\nThe majority of the churches were substantially built in the 16th century and most of the calvaries are of the same period. Throughout the 17th century, the already-impressive churches were embellished with sculpture and decoration, much of it [[polychrome]], turning them into rich and complex exhibitions of Catholic iconography, mostly [[Baroque art|Baroque]] in style.\n\n[[Image:Lampaul05.JPG|thumb|360px|right|Retable of the Passion at\n[[Lampaul-Guimiliau]]]]\n\n==Features==\n\nParish closes are defined by a continuous containing wall, completely surrounding the churchyard, of which the greater area is the parish cemetery. There are often stiles but the only easy entrance is through a ceremonial arch, often elaborately detailed with pinnacles and carving.

It refers to a number of locations in [[Brittany]], mainly though not exclusively in the historic diocese of L\u00e9on, corresponding roughly to the northern half of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Finist\u00e8re]]. These feature an elaborately decorated [[parish]] church surrounded by an entirely walled [[churchyard]], and date from the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\n==The term==\n\nThe term ''enclos paroissial'' seems self-explanatory, but can seem a false friend to the English, especially British English, reader. Cathedral closes are an important feature of urban architecture in Britain and it is easy to assume that a parish close is simply smaller but analogous. Cathedral closes include many residential and administrative buildings, as well as the church. Parish closes are entirely [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic]] in character. The walled churchyard surrounds only buildings and structures designed for worship \u2013 the church, the [[calvary]], and sometimes an [[ossuary]] or [[charnel house]].\n\n==Origins and history==\n\nThere is a tradition of sacred enclosures with marked boundaries ([[fanum]]) in [[Celtic polytheism]]. This reflected a pre-occupation with well-defined sacred features, particularly springs and groves. After the arrival of Christianity, many older traditions and cultural traits persisted within the new religion. The place-name element ''lan'' or ''llan'', now taken to signify a church, originally signified an enclosure. In all [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] Celtic areas, there was a strong association between church enclosures and specific saints, often of a very particular local character. Whatever the persistence of older themes and styles, the parish closes of Brittany took their present form in the early modern period, over a millennium after the region was thoroughly Christianized.\n\nA major factor in permitting the elaboration of parish closes was the relative prosperity of Finist\u00e8re in the 16th century. This was built on the maritime competition and constant warfare that plagued much of Western Europe in this period. A group of parishes, just inland, benefited hugely from supplying the ports with the [[hemp]] and [[linen]] needed to rig ships, as well as food, clothing, and other supplies. This allowed them to engage in friendly civic competition with each other, constructing and embellishing closes that were displayed most effectively during the periodic [[Pardon (ceremony)|pardons]], which attracted pilgrims from all over Brittany and beyond.\n\nThe majority of the churches were substantially built in the 16th century and most of the calvaries are of the same period. Throughout the 17th century, the already-impressive churches were embellished with sculpture and decoration, much of it [[polychrome]], turning them into rich and complex exhibitions of Catholic iconography, mostly [[Baroque art|Baroque]] in style.\n\n[[Image:Lampaul05.JPG|thumb|360px|right|Retable of the Passion at\n[[Lampaul-Guimiliau]]]]\n\n==Features==\n\nParish closes are defined by a continuous containing wall, completely surrounding the churchyard, of which the greater area is the parish cemetery.
