As a popular tourist destination leisure sports like Golf, but most particularly sports associated with its famous beaches, have always been popular. A number of surf clubs line Gold Coasts beaches, who host a variety of swimming and athletic events collected into surf carnivals along with competitions evolved from methods of surf life saving.\n\nMotor racing has a strong history on the coast with racing having been held in the region since 1954, but consistently since the late 1960s with only a small break in the late 1980s as well as hosting the region's largest event, the [[Gold Coast 600]].\n\nThe region has had a sporadic history with professional club sport. Several national competitions in Australia's different football codes and basketball have attempted to establish clubs in the city since the 1980s, often bankrolled by wealthy private owners including Christopher Skase and Clive Palmer, and most such clubs have folded within only a few years. In 2015, only the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in rugby league and the [[Gold Coast Suns]] in Australian rules football are competing in fully professional competitions. No Gold Coast based club has yet won a national premiership in its code.\n\nThe region was the host of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]], building and upgrading various venues all over the Coast. The games were centred on [[Carrara Stadium]].\n\n==Professional sports==\n[[File:Adelaide v Gold Coast - Carrara crowd.jpg|thumb|[[Carrara Stadium]], home of the AFL's Gold Coast Suns.]]\n[[File:Aussie rules game.jpg|thumb|[[Australian rules football]] being played at Carrara Stadium.]]\n[[File:Skilled Park (2008).jpg|thumb|[[Robina Stadium]], home of the NRL's Gold Coast Titans.]]\nThe Gold Coast is currently home to professional sports teams in [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby league]]. These teams are the [[Gold Coast Suns]] ([[Australian Football League]])<ref>{{cite news|title=Official AFL Website of the Gold Coast SUNS|url=http://www.goldcoastfc.com.au|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> and the [[Gold Coast Titans]] ([[National Rugby League]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Official Site of the Gold Coast Titans|url=http://www.titans.com.au|accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> Many other professional clubs have competed in national leagues since the 1980s, but these clubs have consistently struggled to support themselves financially, and have generally folded within a decade of being founded.

The club was forced to play in Tweed Heads due to a clause in the [[Brisbane Broncos]] licence at the time which disallowed any other clubs from playing in south-east Queensland, but was also financially favourable for the club, as the club was allowed to produce revenue through gaming machines which was a legal practice in New South Wales but not in Queensland. In 1990, the team became known as the [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] but continued to play out of Tweed Heads, with the occasional game played at Carrara Stadium. In 1991 the ''[[Gambling in Australia|Gaming Machine Act]]'' passed in Queensland which caused considerable damage to the Seagulls' bottom line, and the club withdrew from the NSWRL in 1995 due to financial strains and the looming [[Super League war]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOh_H1pMSWE How the Gold Coast Titans evolved].

As a popular tourist destination leisure sports like Golf, but most particularly sports associated with its famous beaches, have always been popular. A number of surf clubs line Gold Coasts beaches, who host a variety of swimming and athletic events collected into surf carnivals along with competitions evolved from methods of surf life saving.\n\nMotor racing has a strong history on the coast with racing having been held in the region since 1954, but consistently since the late 1960s with only a small break in the late 1980s as well as hosting the region's largest event, the [[Gold Coast 600]].\n\nThe region has had a sporadic history with professional club sport. Several national competitions in Australia's different football codes and basketball have attempted to establish clubs in the city since the 1980s, often bankrolled by wealthy private owners including Christopher Skase and Clive Palmer, and most such clubs have folded within only a few years. In 2015, only the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in rugby league and the [[Gold Coast Suns]] in Australian rules football are competing in fully professional competitions. No Gold Coast based club has yet won a national premiership in its code.\n\nThe region was the host of the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]], building and upgrading various venues all over the Coast.

The club played at [[Seagulls Stadium]] in [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]], which is located just across the border in [[New South Wales]], but borders the Gold Coast and is considered by many to be a part of the greater Gold Coast area. The club was forced to play in Tweed Heads due to a clause in the [[Brisbane Broncos]] licence at the time which disallowed any other clubs from playing in south-east Queensland, but was also financially favourable for the club, as the club was allowed to produce revenue through gaming machines which was a legal practice in New South Wales but not in Queensland. In 1990, the team became known as the [[Gold Coast Seagulls]] but continued to play out of Tweed Heads, with the occasional game played at Carrara Stadium. In 1991 the ''[[Gambling in Australia|Gaming Machine Act]]'' passed in Queensland which caused considerable damage to the Seagulls' bottom line, and the club withdrew from the NSWRL in 1995 due to financial strains and the looming [[Super League war]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOh_H1pMSWE How the Gold Coast Titans evolved].

The Cougars managed to acquire a second championship in the final season of the Australian Baseball League where they defeated the [[Sydney Storm]] in the [[1998\u201399 Australian Baseball League season|1998\u201399]] Championship series. Although the national Baseball league in Australia was disbanded in 1999, the Gold Coast now hosts the [[Major League Baseball Australia Academy Program]] at Palm Meadows and has produced several [[Major League Baseball]] players since its inception in 2001.\n\n====Ice Hockey====\nIn 2008, the semi-professional Brisbane Blue Tongues in the [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] moved base to Iceland on the Gold Coast and formed the [[Gold Coast Blue Tongues]]. Serious health and safety risks were discovered at the Iceland venue in 2013 and the team was given two years to find an alternate home venue. The Blue Tongues General Manager was unable to secure government funding for a new dual-rink facility on the Gold Coast and the team officially folded in 2015 when their AIHL licence expired.<ref>[http://www.hockeywise.com.au/aihl/gold-coast-blue-tongues-left-out-of-aihl Gold Coast Blue Tongues left out of AIHL]</ref>\n\n====Rugby union====\nThe [[East Coast Aces]] rugby union team were based at Carrara Stadium for the duration of the 2007 [[Australian Rugby Championship]].

O'Brien]] and others as the political wing of the [[Irish Trades Union Congress]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://centenaries-ituc.nationalarchives.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19th-annual-report-1912.pdf|title = Annual Report | publisher = Irish Trades Union Congress | year = 1912 | page = 12}}</ref> It intended to participate in a Dublin Parliament that would follow passage of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule Act 1914]], which was suspended on the outbreak of World War I. Connolly was executed following the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, and was succeeded as leader by [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]]. The party stood aside from the elections of [[1918 Irish general election|1918]] and [[1921 Irish elections|1921]],{{sfn|Labour Party|2011}} but despite divisions over acceptance of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] it took approximately 20% of the vote in the [[1922 Irish general election|1922 elections]],<ref name=\"EB\">{{Britannica|326944|Labour Party (Ireland)}}</ref> initially forming the main [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] party in the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (parliament) of the [[Irish Free State]].\n\nThe subsequent years were marked by rivalry between factions led by [[William X. O'Brien]] and [[James Larkin]], with [[William Norton]] becoming leader. Between 1932 and 1938 the Labour Party supported [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s minority [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] government. From 1948\u20131951 and from 1954\u20131957 the Labour Party entered government alongside [[Fine Gael]] and other parties, with Norton as [[T\u00e1naiste]]. During this period the party also stood for elections in [[Northern Ireland]], after a split in the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]]. In 1960 [[Brendan Corish]] became the new Labour leader. As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party. Between 1973 and 1987 Labour three times more went into coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. [[Dick Spring]] became leader in 1982, amid growing controversy within the party over these coalitions and the growth of parties to the left of Labour.\n\nIn 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became [[President of Ireland]] with Labour support.{{sfn|Labour Party|2011}} After mergers with the [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and the Independent Socialist Party, Labour performed well in the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] and formed a coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il, with Spring as T\u00e1naiste. then in 1994 without a further election joined a coalition with Fine Gael and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] (the \"[[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]\").{{sfn|Labour Party|2011}}  After defeat in the [[1997 Irish general election|1997 general election]], Labour merged with Democratic Left, and the former Democratic Left member [[Pat Rabbitte]] became leader in 2002. Rabbitte implemented the \u201cMullingar Accord\u201d, a pre-election voting pact with Fine Gael, but this did not lead to greater election success for Labour in the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 elections]], and Rabbitte resigned to be replaced by [[Eamon Gilmore]]. The [[2011 Irish general election|2011 general election]] saw one of Labour's best results, with over 19% of the first-preference votes. Labour once more entered a [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il|coalition government]] with Fine Gael, and the [[2011 Irish presidential election|Irish presidential election]] later that year saw the Labour Party's candidate, [[Michael D. Higgins]],  elected as President. However, Labour in government experienced a series of dismissals and resignations among its members in the D\u00e1il. In 2014, Gilmore resigned as party leader after Labour's poor performance in the [[2014 European Parliament election in Ireland|European]] and [[2014 Irish local elections|local elections]], and [[Joan Burton]] was elected as the new leader.\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:Such Meeting or Assemblage is seditious... (9621476054).jpg|thumb|Proclamation banning a public meeting called by [[James Larkin]] in [[Sackville Street (Dublin)|Sackville Street]], Dublin, August 1913]] \nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, considerable debate took place within the [[Irish Trades Union Congress]] on whether the organised trade union movement in Ireland should take part in political activity. [[James Connolly]], and [[James Larkin]] as the leaders of the new and dynamic [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU), led the calls for political action and representation for trade unionists. Opposition came from northern trade unionists and others who wanted links with the [[British Labour Party]], and from supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].\n\nThe catalyst for the launch of a congress-sponsored party was the introduction and successful progress of the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] in 1912.{{sfn|Daly|O'Brien|Rouse|2012|p=5}} At its meeting in [[Clonmel]] in 1912, the congress took up the question of a political party. James Connolly presented the resolution that the congress establish its own party. He argued that since [[Home Rule]] was imminent and would take place once the [[House of Lords]]' delaying powers were exhausted in two years' time, that this period should be used to organise the new party. Connolly's resolution was carried by a wide margin with 49 voting for; 19 against; and 19 abstaining.{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=68}}\n\nThe congress also supported the introduction of salaries for members of parliament, public funding of elections and [[female suffrage]]. The founding of the Labour Party was disrupted by personality differences between Larkin and his fellow leaders, including Connolly. Nevertheless, the 1913 congress meeting under William O'Brien's chairmanship instructed the executive to proceed with the writing of a party constitution.\n\nThe proposed constitution limited party membership to affiliated trade unions and councils only and excluded individual membership and other involvement, such as by co-operative societies and socialist groups. [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]] argued that Labour would be \"swamped\" by farmer co-operatives and that individuals might join through trade councils. Connolly argued that there should be just one body and that a separate Labour Party as in Britain would encourage the \"professional politician\". The ITUC decided to add \"and Labour Party\" to its name and became the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party (ITUC and LP).{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=68}} At the 1914 Congress, it was agreed for the first time to seek the reconstruction of society: \"the Congress urges that labour unrest can only be ended by the abolition of the capitalist system of wealth production with its inherent injustice and poverty.\" Curiously, the ITUC and LP took no part in the [[Dublin Lock-out|1913 lock-out]] struggle in Dublin, and Labour did poorly in local elections in Dublin in January 1914.\n\nThe ITUC and LP was seriously troubled by the proposals in 1914 to exclude certain [[Ulster]] counties from Home Rule as this would undermine the potential of the new party by excluding the substantial industrial areas of north east Ulster. Fourteen of the 34 urban seats in the Home Rule parliament were to be in Belfast alone. The start of the First World War in the summer of 1914 transformed the political situation in Ireland. The Home Rule Bill became law but its operation was postponed until after the war. The official Labour position did not directly oppose Irish support for the British war effort, but it was critical of the war in general terms. Labour skirted the issue in an attempt to avoid division between unionist and nationalist trade unionists. Larkin opposed the war before he left for the USA and Connolly condemned [[John Redmond]]'s support for Irish nationalists involvement in army recruitment. Gradually, Labour opposition to the spectre of conscription moved the party's position closer to that of the separatists. To avoid making a decision on the war, Labour called off its congress in 1915.\n\nJames Connolly was the only leading Labour figure to take part in the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916. His execution after the rebellion left the labour movement in some disarray. [[Liberty Hall]], the physical symbol of the labour movement, was destroyed, and the files of the ITUCLP were seized. Many trade union leaders, in Dublin, who had not taken part in the Rising were interned, such as William O'Brien, but they were released later when the British realised that they had no direct involvement. Their absence allowed non-nationalist leaders to come to the fore, especially Thomas Johnson, who was not charismatic, but was a moderate and hardworking man.\n\nDespite his English background, his sheer diligence and devotion to his duties gave him the leading position in labour politics for the next decade. He managed to persuade the authorities to release the trade union leaders in time for the congress meeting in Sligo in August 1916. In his chairman's address, Johnson avoided taking a stand on the Rising and instead called for a minute's silence to honour the memory of Connolly and his comrades. He mourned the dead in the trenches and expressed personal support for the Allies. Johnson's stance in refusing to accept any responsibility for the Rising was regarded as a success as it avoided division between north and south, and laid the stress on economic and social issues.\n\n==Early history==\nIn Larkin's absence and Connolly's demise, [[William X. O'Brien]] became the dominant figure in the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] joining it in January 1917, and quickly becoming the leader of that union and wielding considerable influence in the Labour Party. O'Brien, along with Johnson, also dominated the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party. O'Brien took a leading role in the growing separatist movement that would become the revitalised [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. The Labour Party, now led by [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]], as successor to such organisations as [[D.D. Sheehan]]'s (independent labour MPs) [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA), found itself marginalised by the preeminence that Sinn F\u00e9in gave to the national question. De Valera and others expressed sympathy for the labour movement's objectives but made clear that Labour must wait. The congress-party strongly opposed the moves to introduce [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription into Ireland in 1918]], and a twenty-four-hour strike was successfully called on 23 April 1918. Only the Belfast area ignored the strike call. That spring, Labour announced that it would take part in the General Election to be held immediately after the war ended. De Valera and other Sinn F\u00e9in leaders were highly critical of what they saw as a divisive step by the ITUCLP. At the congress held in August 1918, the executive reported that Labour's hour of destiny had struck and it found the movement ready. O'Brien urged the development of electoral machinery. At this moment, the first signs of the split between O'Brien and the Larkinites became evident. PT Daly, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Larkin, was locked in a struggle with O'Brien and was beaten by 114 votes to 109 for the post of secretary of the Congress. Daly was later to be purged by O'Brien from the leadership of the ITGWU, setting the scene for a long-lasting split in Irish trade unionism. Following the congress, Labour was finally forced to deal with the issues of national self-determination and abstention from parliament.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in entered into discussions with Labour to secure its abstention from the forthcoming election. Labour was again faced with the dilemma that it might win some seats by entering into a pact with Sinn F\u00e9in at the price of alienation of northern unionist workers. Labour offered a radical election programme. Among other objectives, it declared that it would win for the workers the collective ownership and control of the whole produce of their work; adopt the principles of the Russian Revolution; secure the democratic management of all industries in the interest of the nation; and abolish all privileges which were based on property or ancestry.\n\nIn the end, a special party conference voted by 96 votes to 23 that the ITUCLP would not contest the 1918 [[1918 Irish general election|general election]], to allow the election to take the form of a plebiscite on Ireland's constitutional status. Sinn F\u00e9in went on to gain 73 of the 105 seats in the General Election and convened the First D\u00e1il in January 1919. The Democratic Programme of the [[First D\u00e1il]] was jointly drafted by [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] of Sinn F\u00e9in and Thomas Johnson of Labour. Despite being eventually pruned of much of its socialist content, some of the original radical elements survived. Sinn F\u00e9in paid its debt of honour to the Labour Party for its abstention by including in the Programme that every citizen was to be entitled to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour; the government would concern itself with the welfare of children, and would care for the aged and infirm; and it would seek \"a general and lasting improvement in the conditions under which the working classes live and labour\".\n\nLabour took part in the [[1920 Irish local elections|1920 local elections]] and won a significant role in local government for the first time. It gained 394 seats compared to 550 for Sinn F\u00e9in, 355 for the unionists, 238 for the old nationalists, and 161 independents.\n\nIn 1921, the ITUCLP again agreed with Sinn F\u00e9in that it would not take part in the election for the new Southern Ireland parliament envisaged by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. This left the field clear for Sinn F\u00e9in to treat these elections as the election to the [[Second D\u00e1il]]. As a result of these decisions, the party was absent from the [[D\u00e1il]] during the vital years of the independence struggle. Following the Truce of July 1921, Labour was not involved in any way in the negotiations that led to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921, by which a new [[Irish Free State]] would be established as a Dominion of the British Empire equivalent in status to Canada.\n\n==Labour in the Irish Free State==\nThe [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] divided the Labour party. It did not take an official stand. From his American prison cell, [[Jim Larkin]] opposed the Treaty while the only Labour member of the D\u00e1il, [[Richard Corish]] of Wexford spoke and voted for the Treaty. Johnson, never a republican, privately supported the Treaty, while O'Brien did not oppose it. Following the approval of the Treaty by the D\u00e1il in January 1922, the executive of the ITUCLP succeeded at a special conference held in February, in passing a motion to participate in the forthcoming General Election. Successful Labour candidates were required to take their seats in the new Free State D\u00e1il, and a reformist programme was adopted.\n\nJohnson and the other Labour leaders tried to stop the slide to civil war to no avail,{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=71}} including holding a one-day national strike across the 26 counties on 24 April. Labour candidates were nominated for the election on 16 June, despite the difficulties of poor organisation, internal opposition to participation and limited finance. When The Collins/De Valera Pact was agreed on 20 May, the pressure on the party was intensified. The Pact provided for the pro and anti Treaty sides to have one agreed slate of candidates with a coalition government to be established afterwards. Other parties and groups, including Labour, were asked to stand down again in the national interest. Effectively, the old Sinn F\u00e9in was about to deny a democratic election from being held and to prevent the public expressing their preferences. While de Valera had a notable success in persuading [[Patrick Hogan (Ceann Comhairle)|Patrick Hogan]], a future Labour Ceann Comhairle, from standing in Clare, 18 other Labour candidates resisted the pressures on them from the IRA and went forward for election. These were perceived as pro-Treaty, and when [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] repudiated the Pact four days before the election, it benefited the Labour Party as well as the pro-Treaty party. Seventeen of the eighteen Labour candidates won seats, with the 18th losing only by 13 votes. Some candidates had nearly twice the quota but had no running mates to transfer their surplus votes.\n\nAs well as being a triumph for the Labour Party, the election confirmed the popular acceptance of the Treaty. The Civil War broke out shortly later, between the IRA and the new National Army, and ravaged the country in the following months. The new D\u00e1il did not meet until September preventing Labour from having any influence over events. Public opinion and voting habits crystallised in a deeply polarised fashion in this period between the two sides of the national movement, and led to the effective marginalisation of the Labour Party and of social and economic issues that was to last for the rest of the twentieth century.\n\nWhen the third D\u00e1il eventually met in September, Labour attempted to amend the new Free State Constitution to remove the elements imposed by the Treaty but pragmatically accepted the new order when it was adopted. The Labour deputies took the controversial oath of fidelity to the British monarch, viewing it as a formality.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, an economic slump and collapse in union membership led to a loss in support for the party. In the 1923 election Labour only won 14 seats. However, from 1922 until [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s took their seats in 1927, Labour was the major opposition party in the [[D\u00e1il]]. It attacked the lack of social reform by the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government. Johnson became the leading figure in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the leader of the Opposition to the new Government.\n\nIn 1923 Larkin returned to Ireland. He hoped to take over the leadership role he had left, but O'Brien resisted him. Larkin sided with the more radical elements of the party and in September that year he established the [[Irish Worker League]].\n\nIn 1932 the Labour Party supported [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s first Fianna F\u00e1il government, which had proposed a programme of social reform with which the party was in sympathy.{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=74}} In the 1940s it looked for a while as if Labour would replace [[Fine Gael]] as the main opposition party. In the 1943 general election the party won 17 seats, its best result since 1927. But further aspirations were disappointed as the party was damaged by internal division for the remainder of the decade.\n\n==The split with National Labour and the first coalition governments==\nThe Larkin-O'Brien feud still continued, and worsened over time. In the 1940s the hatred caused a split in the Labour party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. In 1944 O'Brien left and founded the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]]. O'Brien also withdrew the ITGWU from the Irish Trades Union Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the 1944 general election. It was only after Larkin's death in 1947 that an attempt at unity could be made.\n\nDuring this period the party also occasionally stood for election in [[Northern Ireland]], on occasion winning the odd seat at both the [[Westminster Parliament]] and [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]] in the [[Belfast]] area. However the party is not known to have contested an election in the region since [[Gerry Fitt]], then the party's sole Stormont MP, left the party to form the [[Republican Labour Party]] in 1964.\n\nFrom 1948\u20131951 and from 1954\u20131957 the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments. [[William Norton]], the Labour leader, became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and Minister for Social Welfare on both occasions.{{sfn|Gallagher|1982}}\n\n==Labour under Brendan Corish, 1960 \u2013 1977==\nIn 1960 [[Brendan Corish]] became the new Labour leader.{{sfn|Puirs\u00e9il|2007}} As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party.{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=78}} Between 1973 and 1977 the Labour Party formed a coalition government with [[Fine Gael]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> The coalition partners lost the subsequent election in 1977. Corish resigned immediately after the defeat.\n\n==The 1980s: coalition, internal feuding, electoral decline and regrowth==\nFrom 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, Labour participated in coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country's poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of government spending, and Labour bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in health and other social services. In the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]] it received only 6.4% of the vote, and its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]]. Fianna F\u00e1il formed a minority government from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the [[Progressive Democrats]].\n\nThe 1980s saw fierce disagreements between left and right wings of the party. The more radical elements, led by figures including [[Emmet Stagg]], opposed the idea of going into coalition government with either of the major centre-right parties. At the 1989 Labour conference in [[Tralee]] a number of socialist and Marxist activists, organised around the [[Militant (Ireland)|Militant]] newspaper, were expelled. These expulsions continued during the early 1990s and those expelled, including [[Joe Higgins]] went on to found the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]].\n\nThese rows ended with the defeat of the anti-coalition left. In the period since, there have been further discussions about coalitions in the Party but these disagreements have primarily been over the merits of different coalition partners rather than over the principle of coalition. Related arguments have taken place from time to time over the wisdom of entering into pre-election voting pacts with other parties. Indeed, former radicals like Stagg himself and [[Michael D. Higgins]] now themselves support coalition.\n\n==Mary Robinson and coalitions of different hues==\nIn 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became the first [[President of Ireland]] to have been proposed by the Labour Party, although she contested the election as an independent candidate. Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from [[Douglas Hyde]], that a non-[[Fianna F\u00e1il]] candidate was elected. [[Mary Robinson]] became one of the most outspoken and active presidents in the history of the state. In 1990 the Party merged with the [[Limerick East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick East]] TD [[Jim Kemmy]]'s [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and in 1992 it merged with [[Sligo\u2013Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013Leitrim]] TD [[Declan Bree]]'s Independent Socialist Party.\n\nAt the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] on 25 November Labour won a record 19.3% of the first-preference votes, more than twice its share in the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 election]]. The party's representation in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|the D\u00e1il]] doubled to 33 seats and, after a period of negotiations, Labour formed a coalition with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], taking office in January 1993 as the [[23rd Government of Ireland]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> Fianna F\u00e1il leader [[Albert Reynolds]] remained as [[Taoiseach]], and Labour leader [[Dick Spring]] became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].\n\nAfter less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], [[Harry Whelehan]], as president of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna F\u00e1il's loss of two seats in [[List of D\u00e1il by-elections#27th Dail|by-elections in June]] and Labour negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 [[Fine Gael]], the Labour Party, and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] governed in the so-called [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]. [[Dick Spring]] of Labour became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and Minister for Foreign Affairs again.\n\n==Merger with Democratic Left and recent electoral performance==\nLabour presented the 1997 election, held just weeks after spectacular victories for the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]] and Tony Blair's [[New Labour]], as the first ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right, but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and failed to retain half of its D\u00e1il seats. A poor performance by Labour candidate [[Adi Roche]] in the subsequent election for [[President of Ireland]] led to Spring's resignation as party leader.\n\nIn 1997 [[Ruairi Quinn]] became the new Labour leader. Negotiations started almost immediately and in 1999 the Labour Party merged with Democratic Left, keeping the name of the larger partner.\n\nQuinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the general election, when the Labour Party was returned with only 21 seats, the same number of seats as it had held before that General Election. Former Democratic Left [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[Pat Rabbitte]] became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.\n\nIn the June 2004 elections to the [[European Parliament]], [[Proinsias De Rossa]] retained his seat for Labour in the [[Dublin]] constituency. This was Labour's only success in the election.\n\n==21st century==\n[[File:Pat Rabbitte, Michael D Higgins, Derek Nolan.jpg|thumb|Politicians [[Pat Rabbitte]], [[Michael D Higgins]] and [[Derek Nolan]] of the Irish Labour Party in 2010]]\nIn 2004, Labour entered into an election pact in advance of the 2004 Local and European elections. Known as the \"Mullingar Accord\", and undertaken with Fine Gael,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0906/54086-opposition/ | publisher = RT\u00c9 | website = rt.ie | title = Opposition leaders unveil 'Mullingar Accord' |date = 6 September 2004 | accessdate = 14 December 2018}}</ref> a number of mutually acceptable and compatible policy documents were published in the lead up to the elections.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Party conference in [[Tralee]], a pre-election voting transfer pact was also endsored with the Fine Gael party. This saw increased co-operation between the party leaders, Pat Rabbitte and the Fine Gael leader, [[Enda Kenny]], as well as the party's front benches. The two parties formed the \"Alliance for Change\" in the run up to the election and pursued joint policies and economic costings in some policy areas. However though [[Fine Gael]] gained 20 seats in the election in 2007, Labour's vote continued to stagnate at 10.13%, a marginal decline from 2002 and it returned with 20 seats, one less than before.\n\nRabbitte resigned as leader in August 2007, a year ahead of his six-year term came to an end. [[\u00c9amon Gilmore]], Deputy for D\u00fan Laoghaire replaced Rabbitte, and expressed a preference for an independent strategy, emphasising the need for Labour to concentrate on itself, rather than following media interest in its alliance with other parties.\n\nIn the [[2011 Irish general election]], the Labour Party had its \"best ever showing\", winning 37 D\u00e1il seats.<ref name=\"bestworst\">{{cite web|url = https://www.thejournal.ie/labour-ireland-worst-election-ge16-2016-2629803-Mar2016/| publisher = The Journal | website = thejournal.ie | title = Labour just had the worst election in its 104-year history | date = 3 March 2016 | accessdate = 14 December 2018 }}</ref> By the [[2016 Irish general election]], the party had the \"worst election in its 104-year history\", dropping from 37 seats to just 7.<ref name=\"bestworst\"/>\n\nIn the February [[2020 Irish General Election]], this number fell to just 6 seats (4.4% of the popular vote), with longstanding TDs [[Joan Burton]] and [[Jan O\u2019Sullivan]] losing their seats, and [[Longford-Westmeath]] being lost to the retirement of [[Willie Penrose]]. However, Labour improved upon this in the subsequent Seanad Elections, winning 5 seats. \n\nNew senators [[Mark Wall]], [[Annie Hoey]], [[Rebecca Moynihan]] and [[Marie Sherlock]], as well as the re-election of [[Ivana Bacik]] made Labour the 3rd largest party in the Seanad. \n\nOn the same day as the final count of voting in the Seanad Elections on 3rd April, [[Alan Kelly (politician)|Alan Kelly]] edged out D\u00e1il colleague [[Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] to become Labour leader.\n\n==Historical archives==\nThe Labour Party donated its [[archives]] to the [[National Library of Ireland]] in 2012, and is catalogued under call number: MS 49,494.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://catalogue.nli.ie/Collection/vtls000506342 | publisher = National Library of Ireland | website = catalogue.nli.ie | title = Irish Labour Party Archive, 1919-2014 | accessdate = 14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Labour Party (Ireland)]]\n* [[:Category:Labour Party (Ireland) politicians]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book| last1 = Daly |first1 = Paul | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = R\u00f3n\u00e1n | last3 = Rouse | first3 = Paul | title = Making the Difference?: The Irish Labour Party, 1912-2012 | year = 2012 | publisher = Collins Press | isbn = 9781848891425 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book| last = Gallagher | first = Michael | title = The Irish Labour Party in Transition: 1957 - 82 | publisher = Manchester University Press | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780717112500 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Gallagher | first = Michael | title = Political Parties in the Republic of Ireland | publisher = Manchester University Press | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780719017971 | ref = harv | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000gall }}\n* {{cite web|url = https://www.labour.ie/party/ | author = Labour Party | publisher = The Labour Party | website = labour.ie | title = A Brief History of The Labour Party | date = 2011 | accessdate = 14 December 2018 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Puirs\u00e9il | first = Niamh | title = The Irish Labour Party, 1922-73 | year = 2007 | publisher = University College Dublin Press | isbn = 9781904558675 | ref = harv }}\n\n{{Labour Party (Ireland)}}\n\n[[Category:History of the Republic of Ireland|Labour Party]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties]]\n[[Category:Socialist International]]\n[[Category:Labour Party (Ireland)]]\n[[Category:History by political party|Labour Party Irish]]\n[[Category:Political history of Ireland]]\n[[Category:History of organisations based in Ireland|Labour Party]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n[[File:James Connolly2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Connolly]], Irish republican and socialist leader, died 1916]]\n[[File:William X.

Connolly was executed following the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916, and was succeeded as leader by [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]]. The party stood aside from the elections of [[1918 Irish general election|1918]] and [[1921 Irish elections|1921]],{{sfn|Labour Party|2011}} but despite divisions over acceptance of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] it took approximately 20% of the vote in the [[1922 Irish general election|1922 elections]],<ref name=\"EB\">{{Britannica|326944|Labour Party (Ireland)}}</ref> initially forming the main [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] party in the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (parliament) of the [[Irish Free State]].\n\nThe subsequent years were marked by rivalry between factions led by [[William X. O'Brien]] and [[James Larkin]], with [[William Norton]] becoming leader. Between 1932 and 1938 the Labour Party supported [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s minority [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] government. From 1948\u20131951 and from 1954\u20131957 the Labour Party entered government alongside [[Fine Gael]] and other parties, with Norton as [[T\u00e1naiste]]. During this period the party also stood for elections in [[Northern Ireland]], after a split in the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]]. In 1960 [[Brendan Corish]] became the new Labour leader. As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party. Between 1973 and 1987 Labour three times more went into coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. [[Dick Spring]] became leader in 1982, amid growing controversy within the party over these coalitions and the growth of parties to the left of Labour.\n\nIn 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became [[President of Ireland]] with Labour support.{{sfn|Labour Party|2011}} After mergers with the [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and the Independent Socialist Party, Labour performed well in the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] and formed a coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il, with Spring as T\u00e1naiste. then in 1994 without a further election joined a coalition with Fine Gael and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] (the \"[[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]\").{{sfn|Labour Party|2011}}  After defeat in the [[1997 Irish general election|1997 general election]], Labour merged with Democratic Left, and the former Democratic Left member [[Pat Rabbitte]] became leader in 2002. Rabbitte implemented the \u201cMullingar Accord\u201d, a pre-election voting pact with Fine Gael, but this did not lead to greater election success for Labour in the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 elections]], and Rabbitte resigned to be replaced by [[Eamon Gilmore]]. The [[2011 Irish general election|2011 general election]] saw one of Labour's best results, with over 19% of the first-preference votes. Labour once more entered a [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il|coalition government]] with Fine Gael, and the [[2011 Irish presidential election|Irish presidential election]] later that year saw the Labour Party's candidate, [[Michael D. Higgins]],  elected as President. However, Labour in government experienced a series of dismissals and resignations among its members in the D\u00e1il. In 2014, Gilmore resigned as party leader after Labour's poor performance in the [[2014 European Parliament election in Ireland|European]] and [[2014 Irish local elections|local elections]], and [[Joan Burton]] was elected as the new leader.\n\n==Foundation==\n[[File:Such Meeting or Assemblage is seditious... (9621476054).jpg|thumb|Proclamation banning a public meeting called by [[James Larkin]] in [[Sackville Street (Dublin)|Sackville Street]], Dublin, August 1913]] \nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, considerable debate took place within the [[Irish Trades Union Congress]] on whether the organised trade union movement in Ireland should take part in political activity. [[James Connolly]], and [[James Larkin]] as the leaders of the new and dynamic [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU), led the calls for political action and representation for trade unionists. Opposition came from northern trade unionists and others who wanted links with the [[British Labour Party]], and from supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]].\n\nThe catalyst for the launch of a congress-sponsored party was the introduction and successful progress of the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] in 1912.{{sfn|Daly|O'Brien|Rouse|2012|p=5}} At its meeting in [[Clonmel]] in 1912, the congress took up the question of a political party. James Connolly presented the resolution that the congress establish its own party. He argued that since [[Home Rule]] was imminent and would take place once the [[House of Lords]]' delaying powers were exhausted in two years' time, that this period should be used to organise the new party. Connolly's resolution was carried by a wide margin with 49 voting for; 19 against; and 19 abstaining.{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=68}}\n\nThe congress also supported the introduction of salaries for members of parliament, public funding of elections and [[female suffrage]]. The founding of the Labour Party was disrupted by personality differences between Larkin and his fellow leaders, including Connolly. Nevertheless, the 1913 congress meeting under William O'Brien's chairmanship instructed the executive to proceed with the writing of a party constitution.\n\nThe proposed constitution limited party membership to affiliated trade unions and councils only and excluded individual membership and other involvement, such as by co-operative societies and socialist groups. [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]] argued that Labour would be \"swamped\" by farmer co-operatives and that individuals might join through trade councils. Connolly argued that there should be just one body and that a separate Labour Party as in Britain would encourage the \"professional politician\". The ITUC decided to add \"and Labour Party\" to its name and became the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party (ITUC and LP).{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=68}} At the 1914 Congress, it was agreed for the first time to seek the reconstruction of society: \"the Congress urges that labour unrest can only be ended by the abolition of the capitalist system of wealth production with its inherent injustice and poverty.\" Curiously, the ITUC and LP took no part in the [[Dublin Lock-out|1913 lock-out]] struggle in Dublin, and Labour did poorly in local elections in Dublin in January 1914.\n\nThe ITUC and LP was seriously troubled by the proposals in 1914 to exclude certain [[Ulster]] counties from Home Rule as this would undermine the potential of the new party by excluding the substantial industrial areas of north east Ulster. Fourteen of the 34 urban seats in the Home Rule parliament were to be in Belfast alone. The start of the First World War in the summer of 1914 transformed the political situation in Ireland. The Home Rule Bill became law but its operation was postponed until after the war. The official Labour position did not directly oppose Irish support for the British war effort, but it was critical of the war in general terms. Labour skirted the issue in an attempt to avoid division between unionist and nationalist trade unionists. Larkin opposed the war before he left for the USA and Connolly condemned [[John Redmond]]'s support for Irish nationalists involvement in army recruitment. Gradually, Labour opposition to the spectre of conscription moved the party's position closer to that of the separatists. To avoid making a decision on the war, Labour called off its congress in 1915.\n\nJames Connolly was the only leading Labour figure to take part in the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916. His execution after the rebellion left the labour movement in some disarray. [[Liberty Hall]], the physical symbol of the labour movement, was destroyed, and the files of the ITUCLP were seized. Many trade union leaders, in Dublin, who had not taken part in the Rising were interned, such as William O'Brien, but they were released later when the British realised that they had no direct involvement. Their absence allowed non-nationalist leaders to come to the fore, especially Thomas Johnson, who was not charismatic, but was a moderate and hardworking man.\n\nDespite his English background, his sheer diligence and devotion to his duties gave him the leading position in labour politics for the next decade. He managed to persuade the authorities to release the trade union leaders in time for the congress meeting in Sligo in August 1916. In his chairman's address, Johnson avoided taking a stand on the Rising and instead called for a minute's silence to honour the memory of Connolly and his comrades. He mourned the dead in the trenches and expressed personal support for the Allies. Johnson's stance in refusing to accept any responsibility for the Rising was regarded as a success as it avoided division between north and south, and laid the stress on economic and social issues.\n\n==Early history==\nIn Larkin's absence and Connolly's demise, [[William X. O'Brien]] became the dominant figure in the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]] joining it in January 1917, and quickly becoming the leader of that union and wielding considerable influence in the Labour Party. O'Brien, along with Johnson, also dominated the Irish Trades Union Congress and Labour Party. O'Brien took a leading role in the growing separatist movement that would become the revitalised [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. The Labour Party, now led by [[Thomas Johnson (Irish politician)|Thomas Johnson]], as successor to such organisations as [[D.D. Sheehan]]'s (independent labour MPs) [[Irish Land and Labour Association]] (ILLA), found itself marginalised by the preeminence that Sinn F\u00e9in gave to the national question. De Valera and others expressed sympathy for the labour movement's objectives but made clear that Labour must wait. The congress-party strongly opposed the moves to introduce [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription into Ireland in 1918]], and a twenty-four-hour strike was successfully called on 23 April 1918. Only the Belfast area ignored the strike call. That spring, Labour announced that it would take part in the General Election to be held immediately after the war ended. De Valera and other Sinn F\u00e9in leaders were highly critical of what they saw as a divisive step by the ITUCLP. At the congress held in August 1918, the executive reported that Labour's hour of destiny had struck and it found the movement ready. O'Brien urged the development of electoral machinery. At this moment, the first signs of the split between O'Brien and the Larkinites became evident. PT Daly, the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Larkin, was locked in a struggle with O'Brien and was beaten by 114 votes to 109 for the post of secretary of the Congress. Daly was later to be purged by O'Brien from the leadership of the ITGWU, setting the scene for a long-lasting split in Irish trade unionism. Following the congress, Labour was finally forced to deal with the issues of national self-determination and abstention from parliament.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in entered into discussions with Labour to secure its abstention from the forthcoming election. Labour was again faced with the dilemma that it might win some seats by entering into a pact with Sinn F\u00e9in at the price of alienation of northern unionist workers. Labour offered a radical election programme. Among other objectives, it declared that it would win for the workers the collective ownership and control of the whole produce of their work; adopt the principles of the Russian Revolution; secure the democratic management of all industries in the interest of the nation; and abolish all privileges which were based on property or ancestry.\n\nIn the end, a special party conference voted by 96 votes to 23 that the ITUCLP would not contest the 1918 [[1918 Irish general election|general election]], to allow the election to take the form of a plebiscite on Ireland's constitutional status. Sinn F\u00e9in went on to gain 73 of the 105 seats in the General Election and convened the First D\u00e1il in January 1919. The Democratic Programme of the [[First D\u00e1il]] was jointly drafted by [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]] of Sinn F\u00e9in and Thomas Johnson of Labour. Despite being eventually pruned of much of its socialist content, some of the original radical elements survived. Sinn F\u00e9in paid its debt of honour to the Labour Party for its abstention by including in the Programme that every citizen was to be entitled to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour; the government would concern itself with the welfare of children, and would care for the aged and infirm; and it would seek \"a general and lasting improvement in the conditions under which the working classes live and labour\".\n\nLabour took part in the [[1920 Irish local elections|1920 local elections]] and won a significant role in local government for the first time. It gained 394 seats compared to 550 for Sinn F\u00e9in, 355 for the unionists, 238 for the old nationalists, and 161 independents.\n\nIn 1921, the ITUCLP again agreed with Sinn F\u00e9in that it would not take part in the election for the new Southern Ireland parliament envisaged by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. This left the field clear for Sinn F\u00e9in to treat these elections as the election to the [[Second D\u00e1il]]. As a result of these decisions, the party was absent from the [[D\u00e1il]] during the vital years of the independence struggle. Following the Truce of July 1921, Labour was not involved in any way in the negotiations that led to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921, by which a new [[Irish Free State]] would be established as a Dominion of the British Empire equivalent in status to Canada.\n\n==Labour in the Irish Free State==\nThe [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] divided the Labour party. It did not take an official stand. From his American prison cell, [[Jim Larkin]] opposed the Treaty while the only Labour member of the D\u00e1il, [[Richard Corish]] of Wexford spoke and voted for the Treaty. Johnson, never a republican, privately supported the Treaty, while O'Brien did not oppose it. Following the approval of the Treaty by the D\u00e1il in January 1922, the executive of the ITUCLP succeeded at a special conference held in February, in passing a motion to participate in the forthcoming General Election. Successful Labour candidates were required to take their seats in the new Free State D\u00e1il, and a reformist programme was adopted.\n\nJohnson and the other Labour leaders tried to stop the slide to civil war to no avail,{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=71}} including holding a one-day national strike across the 26 counties on 24 April. Labour candidates were nominated for the election on 16 June, despite the difficulties of poor organisation, internal opposition to participation and limited finance. When The Collins/De Valera Pact was agreed on 20 May, the pressure on the party was intensified. The Pact provided for the pro and anti Treaty sides to have one agreed slate of candidates with a coalition government to be established afterwards. Other parties and groups, including Labour, were asked to stand down again in the national interest. Effectively, the old Sinn F\u00e9in was about to deny a democratic election from being held and to prevent the public expressing their preferences. While de Valera had a notable success in persuading [[Patrick Hogan (Ceann Comhairle)|Patrick Hogan]], a future Labour Ceann Comhairle, from standing in Clare, 18 other Labour candidates resisted the pressures on them from the IRA and went forward for election. These were perceived as pro-Treaty, and when [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] repudiated the Pact four days before the election, it benefited the Labour Party as well as the pro-Treaty party. Seventeen of the eighteen Labour candidates won seats, with the 18th losing only by 13 votes. Some candidates had nearly twice the quota but had no running mates to transfer their surplus votes.\n\nAs well as being a triumph for the Labour Party, the election confirmed the popular acceptance of the Treaty. The Civil War broke out shortly later, between the IRA and the new National Army, and ravaged the country in the following months. The new D\u00e1il did not meet until September preventing Labour from having any influence over events. Public opinion and voting habits crystallised in a deeply polarised fashion in this period between the two sides of the national movement, and led to the effective marginalisation of the Labour Party and of social and economic issues that was to last for the rest of the twentieth century.\n\nWhen the third D\u00e1il eventually met in September, Labour attempted to amend the new Free State Constitution to remove the elements imposed by the Treaty but pragmatically accepted the new order when it was adopted. The Labour deputies took the controversial oath of fidelity to the British monarch, viewing it as a formality.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, an economic slump and collapse in union membership led to a loss in support for the party. In the 1923 election Labour only won 14 seats. However, from 1922 until [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s took their seats in 1927, Labour was the major opposition party in the [[D\u00e1il]]. It attacked the lack of social reform by the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] government. Johnson became the leading figure in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the leader of the Opposition to the new Government.\n\nIn 1923 Larkin returned to Ireland. He hoped to take over the leadership role he had left, but O'Brien resisted him. Larkin sided with the more radical elements of the party and in September that year he established the [[Irish Worker League]].\n\nIn 1932 the Labour Party supported [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s first Fianna F\u00e1il government, which had proposed a programme of social reform with which the party was in sympathy.{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=74}} In the 1940s it looked for a while as if Labour would replace [[Fine Gael]] as the main opposition party. In the 1943 general election the party won 17 seats, its best result since 1927. But further aspirations were disappointed as the party was damaged by internal division for the remainder of the decade.\n\n==The split with National Labour and the first coalition governments==\nThe Larkin-O'Brien feud still continued, and worsened over time. In the 1940s the hatred caused a split in the Labour party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. In 1944 O'Brien left and founded the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]]. O'Brien also withdrew the ITGWU from the Irish Trades Union Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the 1944 general election. It was only after Larkin's death in 1947 that an attempt at unity could be made.\n\nDuring this period the party also occasionally stood for election in [[Northern Ireland]], on occasion winning the odd seat at both the [[Westminster Parliament]] and [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont Parliament]] in the [[Belfast]] area. However the party is not known to have contested an election in the region since [[Gerry Fitt]], then the party's sole Stormont MP, left the party to form the [[Republican Labour Party]] in 1964.\n\nFrom 1948\u20131951 and from 1954\u20131957 the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments. [[William Norton]], the Labour leader, became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and Minister for Social Welfare on both occasions.{{sfn|Gallagher|1982}}\n\n==Labour under Brendan Corish, 1960 \u2013 1977==\nIn 1960 [[Brendan Corish]] became the new Labour leader.{{sfn|Puirs\u00e9il|2007}} As leader he advocated and introduced more socialist policies to the party.{{sfn|Gallagher|1985|p=78}} Between 1973 and 1977 the Labour Party formed a coalition government with [[Fine Gael]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> The coalition partners lost the subsequent election in 1977. Corish resigned immediately after the defeat.\n\n==The 1980s: coalition, internal feuding, electoral decline and regrowth==\nFrom 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, Labour participated in coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country's poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of government spending, and Labour bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in health and other social services. In the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]] it received only 6.4% of the vote, and its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]]. Fianna F\u00e1il formed a minority government from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the [[Progressive Democrats]].\n\nThe 1980s saw fierce disagreements between left and right wings of the party. The more radical elements, led by figures including [[Emmet Stagg]], opposed the idea of going into coalition government with either of the major centre-right parties. At the 1989 Labour conference in [[Tralee]] a number of socialist and Marxist activists, organised around the [[Militant (Ireland)|Militant]] newspaper, were expelled. These expulsions continued during the early 1990s and those expelled, including [[Joe Higgins]] went on to found the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]].\n\nThese rows ended with the defeat of the anti-coalition left. In the period since, there have been further discussions about coalitions in the Party but these disagreements have primarily been over the merits of different coalition partners rather than over the principle of coalition. Related arguments have taken place from time to time over the wisdom of entering into pre-election voting pacts with other parties. Indeed, former radicals like Stagg himself and [[Michael D. Higgins]] now themselves support coalition.\n\n==Mary Robinson and coalitions of different hues==\nIn 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became the first [[President of Ireland]] to have been proposed by the Labour Party, although she contested the election as an independent candidate. Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from [[Douglas Hyde]], that a non-[[Fianna F\u00e1il]] candidate was elected. [[Mary Robinson]] became one of the most outspoken and active presidents in the history of the state. In 1990 the Party merged with the [[Limerick East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick East]] TD [[Jim Kemmy]]'s [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] and in 1992 it merged with [[Sligo\u2013Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013Leitrim]] TD [[Declan Bree]]'s Independent Socialist Party.\n\nAt the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] on 25 November Labour won a record 19.3% of the first-preference votes, more than twice its share in the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 election]]. The party's representation in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|the D\u00e1il]] doubled to 33 seats and, after a period of negotiations, Labour formed a coalition with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], taking office in January 1993 as the [[23rd Government of Ireland]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> Fianna F\u00e1il leader [[Albert Reynolds]] remained as [[Taoiseach]], and Labour leader [[Dick Spring]] became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].\n\nAfter less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], [[Harry Whelehan]], as president of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna F\u00e1il's loss of two seats in [[List of D\u00e1il by-elections#27th Dail|by-elections in June]] and Labour negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 [[Fine Gael]], the Labour Party, and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] governed in the so-called [[24th Government of Ireland|Rainbow Coalition]]. [[Dick Spring]] of Labour became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and Minister for Foreign Affairs again.\n\n==Merger with Democratic Left and recent electoral performance==\nLabour presented the 1997 election, held just weeks after spectacular victories for the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]] and Tony Blair's [[New Labour]], as the first ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right, but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and failed to retain half of its D\u00e1il seats. A poor performance by Labour candidate [[Adi Roche]] in the subsequent election for [[President of Ireland]] led to Spring's resignation as party leader.\n\nIn 1997 [[Ruairi Quinn]] became the new Labour leader. Negotiations started almost immediately and in 1999 the Labour Party merged with Democratic Left, keeping the name of the larger partner.\n\nQuinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the general election, when the Labour Party was returned with only 21 seats, the same number of seats as it had held before that General Election. Former Democratic Left [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[Pat Rabbitte]] became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.\n\nIn the June 2004 elections to the [[European Parliament]], [[Proinsias De Rossa]] retained his seat for Labour in the [[Dublin]] constituency. This was Labour's only success in the election.\n\n==21st century==\n[[File:Pat Rabbitte, Michael D Higgins, Derek Nolan.jpg|thumb|Politicians [[Pat Rabbitte]], [[Michael D Higgins]] and [[Derek Nolan]] of the Irish Labour Party in 2010]]\nIn 2004, Labour entered into an election pact in advance of the 2004 Local and European elections. Known as the \"Mullingar Accord\", and undertaken with Fine Gael,<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0906/54086-opposition/ | publisher = RT\u00c9 | website = rt.ie | title = Opposition leaders unveil 'Mullingar Accord' |date = 6 September 2004 | accessdate = 14 December 2018}}</ref> a number of mutually acceptable and compatible policy documents were published in the lead up to the elections.\n\nAt the 2005 Labour Party conference in [[Tralee]], a pre-election voting transfer pact was also endsored with the Fine Gael party. This saw increased co-operation between the party leaders, Pat Rabbitte and the Fine Gael leader, [[Enda Kenny]], as well as the party's front benches. The two parties formed the \"Alliance for Change\" in the run up to the election and pursued joint policies and economic costings in some policy areas. However though [[Fine Gael]] gained 20 seats in the election in 2007, Labour's vote continued to stagnate at 10.13%, a marginal decline from 2002 and it returned with 20 seats, one less than before.\n\nRabbitte resigned as leader in August 2007, a year ahead of his six-year term came to an end. [[\u00c9amon Gilmore]], Deputy for D\u00fan Laoghaire replaced Rabbitte, and expressed a preference for an independent strategy, emphasising the need for Labour to concentrate on itself, rather than following media interest in its alliance with other parties.\n\nIn the [[2011 Irish general election]], the Labour Party had its \"best ever showing\", winning 37 D\u00e1il seats.<ref name=\"bestworst\">{{cite web|url = https://www.thejournal.ie/labour-ireland-worst-election-ge16-2016-2629803-Mar2016/| publisher = The Journal | website = thejournal.ie | title = Labour just had the worst election in its 104-year history | date = 3 March 2016 | accessdate = 14 December 2018 }}</ref> By the [[2016 Irish general election]], the party had the \"worst election in its 104-year history\", dropping from 37 seats to just 7.<ref name=\"bestworst\"/>\n\nIn the February [[2020 Irish General Election]], this number fell to just 6 seats (4.4% of the popular vote), with longstanding TDs [[Joan Burton]] and [[Jan O\u2019Sullivan]] losing their seats, and [[Longford-Westmeath]] being lost to the retirement of [[Willie Penrose]]. However, Labour improved upon this in the subsequent Seanad Elections, winning 5 seats. \n\nNew senators [[Mark Wall]], [[Annie Hoey]], [[Rebecca Moynihan]] and [[Marie Sherlock]], as well as the re-election of [[Ivana Bacik]] made Labour the 3rd largest party in the Seanad. \n\nOn the same day as the final count of voting in the Seanad Elections on 3rd April, [[Alan Kelly]] edged out D\u00e1il colleague [[Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in]] to become Labour leader.\n\n==Historical archives==\nThe Labour Party donated its [[archives]] to the [[National Library of Ireland]] in 2012, and is catalogued under call number: MS 49,494.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://catalogue.nli.ie/Collection/vtls000506342 | publisher = National Library of Ireland | website = catalogue.nli.ie | title = Irish Labour Party Archive, 1919-2014 | accessdate = 14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Labour Party (Ireland)]]\n* [[:Category:Labour Party (Ireland) politicians]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book| last1 = Daly |first1 = Paul | last2 = O'Brien | first2 = R\u00f3n\u00e1n | last3 = Rouse | first3 = Paul | title = Making the Difference?: The Irish Labour Party, 1912-2012 | year = 2012 | publisher = Collins Press | isbn = 9781848891425 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book| last = Gallagher | first = Michael | title = The Irish Labour Party in Transition: 1957 - 82 | publisher = Manchester University Press | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780717112500 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Gallagher | first = Michael | title = Political Parties in the Republic of Ireland | publisher = Manchester University Press | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780719017971 | ref = harv | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/politicalparties0000gall }}\n* {{cite web|url = https://www.labour.ie/party/ | author = Labour Party | publisher = The Labour Party | website = labour.ie | title = A Brief History of The Labour Party | date = 2011 | accessdate = 14 December 2018 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Puirs\u00e9il | first = Niamh | title = The Irish Labour Party, 1922-73 | year = 2007 | publisher = University College Dublin Press | isbn = 9781904558675 | ref = harv }}\n\n{{Labour Party (Ireland)}}\n\n[[Category:History of the Republic of Ireland|Labour Party]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties]]\n[[Category:Socialist International]]\n[[Category:Labour Party (Ireland)]]\n[[Category:History by political party|Labour Party Irish]]\n[[Category:Political history of Ireland]]\n[[Category:History of organisations based in Ireland|Labour Party]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAlan Kelly(link changed toAlan Kelly (politician)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Labour_Party_(Ireland)"}

Usually they have to beat other robots in order to become the best one. Many competitions are for schools but several competitions with professional and hobbyist participants are also arising.\n\n== History ==\n\nRobotic competitions have been organized since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 a [[Micromouse]] competition was organized by the [[IEEE]] as shown in the ''[[IEEE Spectrum|Spectrum]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/tag/maze-runner/ |title=Maze Runner Archives |publisher=cyberneticzoo.com |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the first robotic competition in history two events are well known nowadays for their longevity: the All Japan Sumo from Japan, and the Trinity College International Fire fighting Robot Contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trinityrobotcontest.org/ |title=Trinity College Int'L Firefighting Home Robot Contest |publisher=Trinityrobotcontest.org |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther competitions have grown in popularity with the pass of time, being the [[Robocup]] and the [[Robo One]] two of the main singular events in current times. In parallel companies like [[Lego]] and [[VEX Robotics Competition|VEX]] have developed their own branded events and called them leagues, although they function more like individual cups in regional qualifiers with finals.\n\nThere is some controversy whether university specific challenges should be considered competitions or more workshops, in general the trend is to open competitions to the public in order to prevent nepotism and improve the quality of the robots competing at the event.\n\nSome organizations have been trying to standardize robotics competition through the introduction of full-fledged leagues with a standard calendar, but the model has been only working in specific countries like Spain where the National League was founded in 2008 and is still functioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lnrc.es |title=Liga nacional de robotica de competicion |publisher=Lnrc.es |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Criteria to classify robot competitions ==\n\nThere are many criteria that can be used to classify robot competitions which makes it hard to establish a standard way of referring to them:\n\n* Popularity with public or competitors\n* Indoors versus Outdoors\n* Branded materials (LEGO or VEX) versus Open materials\n* Minors / students versus Professionals / clubs\n* Itinerant (Robocup) versus Fixed-location (All Japan Sumo)\n* Nature of movement: humanoid, wheeled, aerial, aquatic, underwater,...\n\n== Competitions ==\n\n=== Major competitions and organizations ===\nAll these competitions are indoors, itinerant in their location and showcase different categories.

Their skills are put to test in a static judging event, a drag race and a circuit race event, where the vehicles navigate around obstacles and obey the traffic rules. These robots are finding their way in applications such as space exploration, mining, search and rescue, remote sensing and automotive inspection.\n\nRobot Racing is an effort to promote research in autonomous mobile robotics technology. The competition provides students with engineering design challenges, including components of mechanical, computer, control software, and system integration. Students work together to design and build robotic vehicles that can navigate twisting, obstacle-filled courses without any human guidance or control.\n\n=== Mobile Autonomous Systems Laboratory competition (Maslab) ===\nThe [[Mobile Autonomous Systems Laboratory]], or Maslab, is a university-level vision-based autonomous robotics competition.

Usually they have to beat other robots in order to become the best one. Many competitions are for schools but several competitions with professional and hobbyist participants are also arising.\n\n== History ==\n\nRobotic competitions have been organized since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 a [[Micromouse]] competition was organized by the [[IEEE]] as shown in the ''[[IEEE Spectrum|Spectrum]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/tag/maze-runner/ |title=Maze Runner Archives |publisher=cyberneticzoo.com |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the first robotic competition in history two events are well known nowadays for their longevity: the All Japan Sumo from Japan, and the Trinity College International Fire fighting Robot Contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trinityrobotcontest.org/ |title=Trinity College Int'L Firefighting Home Robot Contest |publisher=Trinityrobotcontest.org |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther competitions have grown in popularity with the pass of time, being the [[Robocup]] and the [[Robo One]] two of the main singular events in current times. In parallel companies like [[Lego]] and [[VEX Robotics Competition|VEX]] have developed their own branded events and called them leagues, although they function more like individual cups in regional qualifiers with finals.\n\nThere is some controversy whether university specific challenges should be considered competitions or more workshops, in general the trend is to open competitions to the public in order to prevent nepotism and improve the quality of the robots competing at the event.\n\nSome organizations have been trying to standardize robotics competition through the introduction of full-fledged leagues with a standard calendar, but the model has been only working in specific countries like Spain where the National League was founded in 2008 and is still functioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lnrc.es |title=Liga nacional de robotica de competicion |publisher=Lnrc.es |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Criteria to classify robot competitions ==\n\nThere are many criteria that can be used to classify robot competitions which makes it hard to establish a standard way of referring to them:\n\n* Popularity with public or competitors\n* Indoors versus Outdoors\n* Branded materials (LEGO or VEX) versus Open materials\n* Minors / students versus Professionals / clubs\n* Itinerant (Robocup) versus Fixed-location (All Japan Sumo)\n* Nature of movement: humanoid, wheeled, aerial, aquatic, underwater,...\n\n== Competitions ==\n\n=== Major competitions and organizations ===\nAll these competitions are indoors, itinerant in their location and showcase different categories.  The competitions in this listing have a yearly recurrent major impact in their locations with a huge national impact or an international significant reach.
