Freedom Call has released 12 albums in total, nine of these studio albums.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Background===\nFreedom Call's frontman Chris Bay gained a lot of his vocal ability from his grandfather and mother, an [[opera]] singer with the [[Berlin State Opera]], and his mother, who was a sought-after chorus singer. When only seven he began to play the guitar and by the time he was ten had tried his hand at the piano.<ref name=\"PR\">{{cite journal |first=Roland |last=Hyams |title=FREEDOM CALL - SECOND 'CRYSTAL EMPIRE' ALBUM FROM TOP GERMAN PROGRESSIVE SPEED METAL BAND OUT FEBRUARY 5TH 2001 ON SPV THROUGH KOCH|periodical=Work Hard PR press release |publisher=Work Hard PR |location=[[London]], England |page=1 |date=November 2000}}</ref>\n\nHaving played in various local rock bands, Bay moved to [[Hamburg]] in 1990 and got his first serious gig when he worked with Zed Yago. From 1993 to 1996 Chris was a member of former [[Victory (band)|Victory]] guitarist Hermann Frank's band Moon Doc, with whom he recorded the albums \"Moon Doc\" (1995) and \"Get Mooned\" (1996).<ref name=\"PR\"/>\n\n===Founding (1997\u20131998)===\nIn 1998 Chris Bay and old friend [[Dan Zimmermann|Daniel Zimmermann]] formed Freedom Call during an off-period for the latter's main band, [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]]. The two had started writing songs together towards the end of 1997.<ref name=\"Freedom Call Happy People Who Make Happy Music\">{{cite web |url=http://www.headbanger.ru/interviews/351?lng=en|title=Freedom Call Happy People Who Make Happy Music |publisher=www.headbanger.ru |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> They eventually completed a six-song demo ''Freedom Call'' with well-known producer [[Charlie Bauerfeind]], who offered the tape to several record companies.\n\nAt the same time, the Freedom Call line up was completed by Ilker Ersin on bass guitar and [[Sascha Gerstner]] on guitar. In 1998 Chris and Dan had seen Sascha playing in a [[cover band]].<ref name=\"PR\"/>\n\n===''Stairway to Fairyland'' and ''Crystal Empire'' (1999\u20132001)===\nFreedom Call's debut album, ''Stairway to Fairyland'' was released on 7 May 1999 by NTS Records. ''Stairway to Fairyland'' would sell over 35,000 copies. On 25 May 1999 Freedom Call made their live debut during a tour of France as support band for [[Angra (band)|Angra]] and [[Edguy]].<ref name=\"PR\"/> At the end of August, Freedom Call commenced recording of the five-track mini LP ''Taragon''. [[Taragon (EP)|Taragon]] featured new songs, a cover version of [[Ultravox]]'s \"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\", a new version of \"Stairway to Fairyland\", a new version of \"Tears of Taragon\" with [[Biff Byford]], singer with [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] narrating the \"Tale of Taragon\" on it. There was also a bonus track for [[Japan]] called \"Kingdom Come\".\n\nBy the end of 1999, Freedom Call had entered the studio again to record their second album ''Crystal Empire'', this released on 22 January 2001. ''[[Crystal Empire]]'' was promoted as the logical musical continuation of ''Stairway To Fairyland''.<ref name=\"PR\"/>\n\nIn March 2001 Sascha Gerstner left Freedom Call (he would later join [[Helloween]]). Gerstner was eventually replaced by [[C\u00e9dric \"Cede\" Dupont]], the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] guitarist of [[Symphorce]].<ref name=\"Freedom Call\"/>\n\n===''Eternity'' and ''The Circle of Life'' (2002\u20132006)===\nIn the middle of January 2002 the new lineup began recording a new album called ''[[Eternity (Freedom Call album)|Eternity]]''.
