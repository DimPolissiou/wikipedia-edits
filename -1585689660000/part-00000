Buchanan seriously challenged Bush (whose popularity was waning) when he won 38% of the seminal [[New Hampshire primary]]. In the primary elections, Buchanan garnered three million total votes or 23% of the vote.\n\nBuchanan later threw his support behind Bush and delivered an address at the 1992 [[Republican National Convention]], which became known as the [[culture war]] speech, in which he described \"a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Buchanan|first=Patrick 'Pat' Joseph|url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148?doing_wp_cron=1478487975.2316689491271972656250|title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech|publisher=buchanan.org}}</ref> In the speech, he said of [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]:\n\n{{quote|text=The agenda Clinton & Clinton would impose on America{{mdash}}abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test for the Supreme Court]], homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units{{mdash}}that's change, all right.

To promote the principles of federalism, traditional values, and anti-intervention, he founded The American Cause, a conservative educational foundation, in 1993. [[Bay Buchanan]] serves as the [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia|VA]]-based foundation's president and Pat is its chairman.<ref name=\"AboutAmericanCause\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericancause.org/about.htm|work=The American Cause|title=About the Cause|accessdate=November 4, 2006|publisher=Patrick 'Pat' Joseph Buchanan}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan returned to radio as host of ''Buchanan and Company'', a three-hour talk show for [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] on July 5, 1993. It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including [[Barry W. Lynn|Barry Lynn]], [[Bob Beckel]], and [[Chris Matthews]], in a time slot opposite [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.\n\n===1996 presidential primaries===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996}}\n\nBuchanan made another attempt to win the Republican nomination in the 1996 primaries.  With a Democratic President ([[Bill Clinton]]) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] having made clear he was not interested in re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], who was considered to have many weaknesses.  Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. [[Phil Gramm]] of [[Texas]], former [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]] [[Lamar Alexander]] and the multi-millionaire publisher [[Steve Forbes]].\n\nIn February, the liberal [[Center for Public Integrity]] issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, [[Larry Pratt]], appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Union Leader]]'' he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence \"to answer these charges,\" \"so as not to have distraction in the campaign.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Buchanan Aide Leaves Campaign Amid Charges|newspaper=[[The Union Leader]]|date=February 16, 1996}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan defeated Dole by about 3,000 votes to win the February [[New Hampshire primary]], getting his campaign off to an energetic start. He was endorsed by conservative [[Phyllis Schlafly]], among others. He won three other states ([[Alaska]], [[Missouri]], and [[Louisiana]]), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the [[Iowa caucus]]. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:\n{{quote|text=We shocked them in Alaska. Stunned them in Louisiana. Stunned them in Iowa. They are in a terminal panic. They hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. All the knights and barons will be riding into the castle pulling up the drawbridge in a minute. All the peasants are coming with pitchforks.

Having collected only 21% of the total votes or 3.1 million in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a [[pro-choice]] running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]) candidate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Porteous|first=Skipp|url=http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9604/phillips.html|date=April 1996|title=Howard Phillips on Pat Buchanan|journal=Freedom Writer|publisher=Public Eye}}</ref> Dole chose [[Jack Kemp]] and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. He also began a series of books with 1998's ''The Great Betrayal''.\n\n===2000 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Reform Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000}}\n[[File:Buchanan 2000 reform.png|250px|right]]\nBuchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"[[beltway]] party.\" He sought the nomination of the [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]]. Many reformers backed [[Iowa]] physicist [[John Hagelin]], whose platform was based on [[Transcendental Meditation]].  Party founder [[Ross Perot]] did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party's nomination.  (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot's 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.)\n\nSupporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \"tainted.\"  The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.\n\nUltimately, when the [[Federal Elections Commission]] ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]], Buchanan won the nomination.  In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the UN from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.\n\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, [[Ezola B. Foster]]. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future [[Socialist Party USA]] presidential candidate [[Brian Moore (political activist)|Brian Moore]], who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over [[free trade]].

(Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the [[United States Natural Law Party|Natural Law]] candidate.) In [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], Buchanan received 3,407 votes{{mdash}}which some saw as inconsistent with [[Palm Beach County]]'s liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous \"[[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida#Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots|butterfly ballot]]\", he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman [[Ari Fleischer]] stated, \"Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.\" Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500.  Appearing on ''The Today Show'', Buchanan said: \"When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it's very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for [[Al Gore]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showflorida2000.php?fileid=buchanan11-09|title=Pat Buchanan on NBC's Today Show|date=November 9, 2000}}</ref>\n\nSome observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Havrilesky|first=Heather|url=http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/|title=Not standing Pat|work=Salon|date=October 25, 1999|accessdate=June 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423233336/http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/|archive-date=April 23, 2008|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Later political involvement===\nFollowing the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the [[neo-conservative]] Republican party leadership. Prior to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 re-election, writing: \"Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values.

To promote the principles of federalism, traditional values, and anti-intervention, he founded The American Cause, a conservative educational foundation, in 1993. [[Bay Buchanan]] serves as the [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia|VA]]-based foundation's president and Pat is its chairman.<ref name=\"AboutAmericanCause\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericancause.org/about.htm|work=The American Cause|title=About the Cause|accessdate=November 4, 2006|publisher=Patrick 'Pat' Joseph Buchanan}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan returned to radio as host of ''Buchanan and Company'', a three-hour talk show for [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] on July 5, 1993. It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including [[Barry W. Lynn|Barry Lynn]], [[Bob Beckel]], and [[Chris Matthews]], in a time slot opposite [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.\n\n===1996 presidential primaries===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996}}\n\nBuchanan made another attempt to win the Republican nomination in the 1996 primaries.  With a Democratic President ([[Bill Clinton]]) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] having made clear he was not interested in re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], who was considered to have many weaknesses.  Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. [[Phil Gramm]] of [[Texas]], former [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]] [[Lamar Alexander]] and the multi-millionaire publisher [[Steve Forbes]].\n\nIn February, the liberal [[Center for Public Integrity]] issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, [[Larry Pratt]], appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Union Leader]]'' he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence \"to answer these charges,\" \"so as not to have distraction in the campaign.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Buchanan Aide Leaves Campaign Amid Charges|newspaper=[[The Union Leader]]|date=February 16, 1996}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan defeated Dole by about 3,000 votes to win the February [[New Hampshire primary]], getting his campaign off to an energetic start. He was endorsed by conservative [[Phyllis Schlafly]], among others. He won three other states ([[Alaska]], [[Missouri]], and [[Louisiana]]), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the [[Iowa caucus]]. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:\n{{quote|text=We shocked them in Alaska. Stunned them in Louisiana. Stunned them in Iowa. They are in a terminal panic. They hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. All the knights and barons will be riding into the castle pulling up the drawbridge in a minute. All the peasants are coming with pitchforks.

Having collected only 21% of the total votes or 3.1 million in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a [[pro-choice]] running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]) candidate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Porteous|first=Skipp|url=http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9604/phillips.html|date=April 1996|title=Howard Phillips on Pat Buchanan|journal=Freedom Writer|publisher=Public Eye}}</ref> Dole chose [[Jack Kemp]] and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. He also began a series of books with 1998's ''The Great Betrayal''.\n\n===2000 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Reform Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000}}\n[[File:Buchanan 2000 reform.png|250px|right]]\nBuchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"[[beltway]] party.\" He sought the nomination of the [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]]. Many reformers backed [[Iowa]] physicist [[John Hagelin]], whose platform was based on [[Transcendental Meditation]].  Party founder [[Ross Perot]] did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party's nomination.  (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot's 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.)\n\nSupporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \"tainted.\"  The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.\n\nUltimately, when the [[Federal Elections Commission]] ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]], Buchanan won the nomination.  In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the UN from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.\n\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, [[Ezola B. Foster]]. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future [[Socialist Party USA]] presidential candidate [[Brian Moore (political activist)|Brian Moore]], who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over [[free trade]].

(Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the [[United States Natural Law Party|Natural Law]] candidate.) In [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], Buchanan received 3,407 votes{{mdash}}which some saw as inconsistent with [[Palm Beach County]]'s liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous \"[[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida#Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots|butterfly ballot]]\", he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman [[Ari Fleischer]] stated, \"Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.\" Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500.  Appearing on ''The Today Show'', Buchanan said: \"When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it's very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for [[Al Gore]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showflorida2000.php?fileid=buchanan11-09|title=Pat Buchanan on NBC's Today Show|date=November 9, 2000}}</ref>\n\nSome observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Havrilesky|first=Heather|url=http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/|title=Not standing Pat|work=Salon|date=October 25, 1999|accessdate=June 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423233336/http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/|archive-date=April 23, 2008|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Later political involvement===\nFollowing the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the [[neo-conservative]] Republican party leadership. Prior to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 re-election, writing: \"Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values.

Depending on how they are hung, the viewer sees other faces, bodies, or city views.

Depending on how they are hung, the viewer sees other faces, bodies, or city views.

{"title_page": "Alexander Rofe", "text_new": "{{BLP sources |date=April 2011}}  \n'''Alexander Rof\u00e9''' (born June 22, 1932) is [[Professor Emeritus]] of the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]] at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]].\n\n==Curriculum vitae==\nRof\u00e9 was born in [[Pisa]], [[Italy]] in 1932. His father, Gersh Roifer was active in the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and directed the maritime school of the [[Betar]] movement in [[Civitavecchia]]. His mother, Matilde Gallichi, taught classics at high school; she was descended from a family that had lived in [[Tuscany]] for generations. Before his death in August 1938, Gersh Roifer directed his wife to make [[Aliyah]] (immigration to the [[Land of Israel]]) with the children. In the fall of 1939 the family settled in the Land of Israel. Rofe' attended schools in various places in this country and graduated from the [[Ohel Shem]] high school in [[Ramat Gan]]. At the Hebrew University he studied Hebrew Bible and the [[History of Israel]]. His teachers in Bible were [[Umberto Cassuto|M.D. Cassuto]], [[Yehezkel Kaufmann|Y. Kaufmann]], I.L. Seeligmann, [[Shemaryahu Talmon|S. Talmon]], M. Weiss, M. Haran, S.E. Loewenstamm; in History of Israel \u2013 [[Benjamin Mazar|B. Mazar]], A. Malamat, A. Shalit; in Assyriology \u2013 [[Hayim Tadmor|H. Tadmor]], in Hebrew Language \u2013 [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai|N. H. Tur-Sinai]], [[Yechezkel Kutscher|E.Y. Kutscher]], [[Ze'ev Ben-HaimZ|Ben-Haim]], S. Morag; in History of Religions \u2013 [[David Flusser|D. Flusser]], R.J.Z. Werblowsky. Rofe' wrote his dissertation under the supervision of I.L. Seeligmann, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1970.\n\nSince 1959, Rof\u00e9 has taught in the following academic institutions: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, [[Haifa University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Philadelphia), [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] (Beer Sheva), [[Yale University]] (New Haven, CT), [[Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze]] (Italy), [[The Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York, [[Moscow University for the Humanities|The Humanistic University in Moscow]], [[Hebrew Union College]] in Cincinnati (Ohio), [[Pontificio Istituto Biblico]] (Rome, Italy), [[Studium Biblicum Franciscanum]] (Jerusalem), [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Ariel University Center of Samaria]], [[Facolt\u00e0 Teologica di Sicilia]] (Palermo, Italy). In addition he offered guest lectures in the following universities: [[Rome]], [[Pisa]], [[Turin]], [[The Catholic University in Milan]], [[Venice]], [[Catania]] (Sicily), [[Sorbon]] (Paris), [[Marburg]], [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[T\u00fcbingen]] (Germany), [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (New York), [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]] (Waltham, MA), [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] (Indiana).\n\nRof\u00e9 taught at the Hebrew University for nearly forty years. He was promoted to full professorship in 1986 and retired in 2000. He had served twice as head of the Department of Bible. He co-edited the series of monographs Jerusalem Bible Studies between the years 1979-1986 and has been editor and coeditor of ''Textus'', Studies of the Hebrew University Bible Project, between the years 1995\u20132009.\n\nRof\u00e9 married Esther Kessler in 1954. They have four children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\n==Research==\nRof\u00e9 has contributed to three fields of study in the Hebrew Bible: [[textual criticism]], history of literature, and history of the Israelite religion. In his research he strives to integrate these fields, because each one of them is advanced by perceptions obtained in the other two.\n\n1. His first book, '''The Israelite Belief in Angels''' (Ph.D. dissertation, 1969, Hebrew, published 1979  <ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/israelite-belief-in-angels-in-the-pre-exilic-period-as-evidenced-by-biblical-traditions-english-absctract-of-a-thesis-submitted-for-the-degree-doctor-of-philosophy/oclc/27205197&referer=brief_results]</ref>  ) hypothesizes that the Hebrew belief in [[angels]] was an attempt at fitting ancient [[polytheistic]] traditions into the frame of a [[monotheistic]] faith. He suggests that the Hebrew term \"the destroying angel\" actually refers to the Canaanite god Reshep, and that the site of [[Bethel]] (which is Hebrew for \"house of God\") actually deals with a pagan god, who he claims is present in extra-biblical sources. This was one of the aspects of the ancient biblical angelology in pre-exilic times. He suggests that the Septuagint, in Gen 32: 2-3 and Deut 32: 8-9, 43, provides evidence of this possible change in Hebrew paradigms. If true, he claims that such a polytheistic origin of the belief in angels could explain why passages of Scripture attributed to D and P (two proposed partial content sources for the [[Pentateuch]]) silence all mentions of angels. Both [[Qoheleth]] and the [[Sadducees]] later developed an aversion to believing in angels; however, by that time, a full-fledged angelology was developing amidst [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] circles.\n\n2a. '''The Religion of Ancient Israel and the Text of the Hebrew Bible'''. Over the years, Rof\u00e9 has dedicated quite a few articles to the question of how far the development of the Israelite religion affected the transmission of the Biblical text. In the wake of scholars such as [[Abraham Geiger|A. Geiger]] and I.L. Seeligmann, Rof\u00e9 suggested that textual corrections due to the following tenets may have taken place:\n(1) the unification of worship in [[Jerusalem]]\n(2) enhancing the observance of the [[Torah]]\n(3) obliteration of the epithet SEBA'OT from God's name\n(4) rejection of pillars as cultic objects\n(5) negation of the possibility that [[God]] hates Israel\n(6) deference to Israel's dignitaries and aversion to the wicked.\n\nThe study of these corrections contributes to understanding the beliefs of the scribes that transmitted the Biblical books in the first generations after their composition.\n\n2b. Another aspect of '''textual criticism''' is its contact with the history of Biblical literature.  Rof\u00e9 emphasized that these two realms are interdependent. Thus he argued, on the basis of literary-stylistic considerations, that in [[Deuteronomy]] 5 the shorter text presented by the tefillin from [[Qumran]] should be preferred over against all other textual witnesses. In [[Joshua]] 20, arguments derived from [[higher criticism]] (i.e., the discipline that defines and dates sundry documents in the Biblical books) proved the superiority of the shorter text witnessed by the [[Septuagint]]. Contrariwise, in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 6  Rof\u00e9 opines that the Massoretic Text (=MT) has the precedence while the Qumran manuscript 4QJudg erroneously skipped vss. 7-10; this too is inferred from the 19th century higher criticism that identified an ancient Elohistic redaction in the Book of Judges.\n\n2c. In the study of the '''Biblical text''' there are no rigid rules.  Rof\u00e9 maintains that the scribes who first copied the inherited works were rather sophisticated. At times, indeed, they piled additions upon their texts, but otherwise they abridged their documents on literary or ideological grounds. In the story of [[David and Goliath]] (1 Samuel 17), there are linguistic and literary arguments for the precedence of the MT over against the shorter one represented by the Septuagint (=LXX). In the book of [[Jeremiah]] the situation is more complex: sometimes the shorter text, represented by the LXX, can be considered as a kind of 'first edition', but more often the shorter text derived from editorial interventions of late scribes, who operated according to their literary and theological conceptions. On these issues  Rof\u00e9 differed from the views of his colleague [[Emanuel Tov]].\n\n2d. The study of '''[[theological]] views in the Bible''' led Rof\u00e9 to the identification of secondary, midrashic elements in the textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible. These elements are evident in short glosses, appended to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 2: 3 in a Qumran scroll, [[1 Kings]] 22:28 in the MT and [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 4: 11 in the LXX. But in addition Rof\u00e9 pointed out [[midrashic]] elaborations that affected a whole biblical book. This is the case of the Qumran scroll 4Q51, usually designated as 4QSama. Rof\u00e9 highlighted the various midrashic elements in this manuscript and thereby inferred that one should not define this scroll as representing the book of [[Samuel]]; rather it is an ancient [[Midrash Samuel]]. Here Rof\u00e9 differed with F.M. Cross and his students from the Harvard School.\n\n3. The [[Documentary Hypothesis]] and the Composition of the [[Pentateuch]]. A study of the religious thought in the Torah entails taking a stand vis-\u00e0-vis the Documentary Hypothesis. This happened to Rof\u00e9 in his study of the belief in angels. In his opinion, there is no reason to contest the existence of the major documents in the Pentateuch \u2013 D, produced by the Deuteronomic writers, and P, created in the Priestly school. However, the bulk of the narrative material cannot be subdivided as usual between the four putative documents, J, E, D, P. An instructive case in point is the story of [[Balaam]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22: 2 \u2013 24: 25. He proposed that the story was not composed by the fusion of the accounts of the documents J and E. Rather, he claims that the story of Balaam was based on a legend that grew up gradually and organically. He hypothesized that the speeches of Numbers 24 which presented Balaam as one \"who knows the knowledge of the Most High\" actually were written first, and the incident involving an angel, Balaam, and his donkey (Numbers 22: 22-35) came later. Also, a study of the Betrothal of [[Rebecca|Rebekkah]] (Genesis 24) led him to similar conclusions: he claims that the story is not part of the hypothetical document J, but an independent piece; it is a paradigm composed in post-exilic times in order to teach the people of Judea the proper choice in match-making. See below, at paragraph 6, for further stories of this kind.\n\n4a. '''The Prophetical Stories''': The Narratives about the Prophets in the Hebrew Bible \u2013 Their Literary Types and History (Hebrew: 1982, 1986; English: 1988). In the ten chapters of this book Rof\u00e9 summarized eighteen years of study, between 1964 and 1982. This is a first effort in Biblical research to present a comprehensive description of all the stories about the prophets, defining their genres, such as [[legend]], [[biography]], [[historiography]], [[parables]], and determining the  origin of the genres and their subsequent development. The legenda, for instance, came into being among the admirers of [[Elisha]], around the end of the 9th century BCE. The parable appeared when the disciples of the prophets began to discuss the nature of the prophets' mission and of the word of the Lord pronounced by them. This genre was probably created in late pre-exilic and early post-exilic times. The climax of the prophetical stories is the epopee about [[Elijah]] and the Lord's fight against Baal. In its last phases, the prophetical narrative described its heroes as martyrs who taught foreigners the omnipotence of the god of Israel.\n\n4b. '''The theological discussion about the essence of prophecy'''. The quality of the word of the Lord engaged the disciples of the prophets for a long time in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Is the word of the Lord always fulfilled? The question was raised and received a positive answer in an addition to the law concerning prophecy in Deut 18: 21-22. The same view transpires from the Deuteronomistic redaction of the book of Kings and is proclaimed by Deutero-Isaiah. The opposite stand was taken by the author of Jonah, by the Deuteronomistic editor of Jeremiah, and an editor of [[Ezekiel]] (Ch. 33). Trito-Isaiah joined them while contesting the views of his master, Deutero-Isaiah. The identification of this divergence led Rof\u00e9 to define anew the border between the words of Deutero-and Trito-Isaiah. To the former one should attribute chs. 40-53, to the latter \u2013 chs. 54-66. Indeed, Abraham Kuenen suggested this as early as 1886.\n\n5. '''The Introduction to [[Deuteronomy]]''': Part I and Further Chapters (Hebrew: 1988) grew out of notes distributed to students of Bible at the Hebrew University in the wake of the [[Yom Kippur war]] (1973), because of the teacher's and the students' absence from classes. This Introduction attempts at describing the contents of Deuteronomy and its structure which mainly consists of two covenants: Horeb (4:44 - 28:68 + 30: 1 - 10) and the one in the Land of Moab (28: 69 \u2013 30: 20). The latter covenant has a clear affinity to vassal treaties, mainly Hittite, of the Second Millennium BCE.  Rof\u00e9s enquiry, however, is principally not comparative, but internal; it seeks to uncover the history of Deuteronomy, especially its legal corpus, by dwelling on its duplications and contradictions. Thus the various layers have been exposed: first, prae-Deuteronomic inherited material, then Deuteronomic legislation that preceded the [[Josiah]] reform of 622 BCE, further an additional, later layer from the time of the reform itself, finally a post-reform layer that supplemented and interpreted the earlier legislation. This kind of work reached into post-exilic times.  Rof\u00e9s study confirms the conclusion, already expressed by former scholars, that the ultimate origin of  the Deuteronomic movement was in the ancient holy site of [[Shechem]], probably in the 10th century BCE. A significant portion of this research has been published in English: Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretation (Edinburgh 2002).\n\n6. '''The Introduction to the Literature of the Hebrew Bible''' (Hebrew: 2006, 2007; English: 2009).  As usual in books of introduction, this work does not strive for innovations, but attempts at describing the problems brought to light by the discipline and the methods applied to solve them. The particular merit of this Introduction is that it does not merely present the conclusions reached by the Biblical research, but it shows the course that led to them. For instance, Part 3 \"The Prophetic Literature\" poses some fundamental questions: Did the disciples of the prophets introduce additions into the words of their masters? Did they rework them? What are the proofs to their interventions? How can one distinguish between prophecy and apocalyptic?  Part 4, \"Psalmody\", not only summarized the method of Hermann Gunkel, but also criticized it; the same was done with his main detractor, Meir Weiss. A peculiarity of this introduction is its chapter \"Late Narrative\" (Part I, Chapter 4). Here  Rof\u00e9 brought together findings from his previous studies. Signs of late composition clearly indicate that the stories about the betrothal of Rebekkah (Genesis 24), the rape of [[Dinah]] (Genesis 34), David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), the wars with [[Aram Damascus|Aram]] (1 Kings 20), the vineyard of [[Naboth]] (1 Kings 21: 1-16) were all written in post-exilic times. They reflect problems and expectations of the people of Yehud  in Persian times. These findings run against the Documentary Hypothesis in the Pentateuch and the hypothesis of a single Deuteronomistic composition from Deuteronomy 1 to 2 Kings 25. The creation of the Biblical literature was a multifarious process that extended over a longer span than the one usually accepted in Biblical criticism.\n\n==Publications==\n\n=== Books ===\nThe Prophetical Stories (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1988);Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretation (London:Clark & Continuum, 2002); Introduction to the Literature of the Hebrew Bible (Jerusalem: Simor-Eisenbrauns, 2009);Angels in the Bible: Israelite Belief in Angels as Evidenced by Biblical Traditions (Hebrew; Jerusalem: Carmel 2012).\n\n===Articles by subject===\n{{Navbox\n|navbar     = plain\n|title      = The Composition of Biblical Literature\n|state      = collapsed\n|list1      = \n#\"Joshua 20: Historico-Literary Criticism Illustrated\", ''Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism'', ed. by J.H.

His father, Gersh Roifer was active in the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and directed the maritime school of the [[Betar]] movement in [[Civitavecchia]]. His mother, Matilde Gallichi, taught classics at high school; she was descended from a family that had lived in [[Tuscany]] for generations. Before his death in August 1938, Gersh Roifer directed his wife to make [[Aliyah]] (immigration to the [[Land of Israel]]) with the children. In the fall of 1939 the family settled in the Land of Israel. Rofe' attended schools in various places in this country and graduated from the [[Ohel Shem]] high school in [[Ramat Gan]]. At the Hebrew University he studied Hebrew Bible and the [[History of Israel]]. His teachers in Bible were [[Umberto Cassuto|M.D. Cassuto]], [[Yehezkel Kaufmann|Y. Kaufmann]], I.L. Seeligmann, [[Shemaryahu Talmon|S. Talmon]], M. Weiss, M. Haran, S.E. Loewenstamm; in History of Israel \u2013 [[Benjamin Mazar|B. Mazar]], A. Malamat, A. Shalit; in Assyriology \u2013 [[Hayim Tadmor|H. Tadmor]], in Hebrew Language \u2013 [[Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai|N. H. Tur-Sinai]], [[Yechezkel Kutscher|E.Y. Kutscher]], [[Ze'ev Ben-HaimZ|Ben-Haim]], S. Morag; in History of Religions \u2013 [[David Flusser|D. Flusser]], R.J.Z. Werblowsky. Rofe' wrote his dissertation under the supervision of I.L. Seeligmann, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1970.\n\nSince 1959, Rof\u00e9 has taught in the following academic institutions: The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, [[Haifa University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] (Philadelphia), [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] (Beer Sheva), [[Yale University]] (New Haven, CT), [[Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze]] (Italy), [[The Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York, [[Moscow University for the Humanities|The Humanistic University in Moscow]], [[Hebrew Union College]] in Cincinnati (Ohio), [[Pontificio Istituto Biblico]] (Rome, Italy), [[Studium Biblicum Franciscanum]] (Jerusalem), [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Ariel University Center of Samaria]], [[Facolt\u00e0 Teologica di Sicilia]] (Palermo, Italy). In addition he offered guest lectures in the following universities: [[Rome]], [[Pisa]], [[Turin]], [[The Catholic University in Milan]], [[Venice]], [[Catania]] (Sicily), [[Sorbon]] (Paris), [[Marburg]], [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[T\u00fcbingen]] (Germany), [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (New York), [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]] (Waltham, MA), [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] (Indiana).\n\nRof\u00e9 taught at the Hebrew University for nearly forty years. He was promoted to full professorship in 1986 and retired in 2000. He had served twice as head of the Department of Bible. He co-edited the series of monographs Jerusalem Bible Studies between the years 1979-1986 and has been editor and coeditor of ''Textus'', Studies of the Hebrew University Bible Project, between the years 1995\u20132009.\n\nRof\u00e9 married Esther Kessler in 1954. They have four children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\n==Research==\nRof\u00e9 has contributed to three fields of study in the Hebrew Bible: [[textual criticism]], history of literature, and history of the Israelite religion. In his research he strives to integrate these fields, because each one of them is advanced by perceptions obtained in the other two.\n\n1. His first book, '''The Israelite Belief in Angels''' (Ph.D. dissertation, 1969, Hebrew, published 1979  <ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/israelite-belief-in-angels-in-the-pre-exilic-period-as-evidenced-by-biblical-traditions-english-absctract-of-a-thesis-submitted-for-the-degree-doctor-of-philosophy/oclc/27205197&referer=brief_results]</ref>  ) hypothesizes that the Hebrew belief in [[angels]] was an attempt at fitting ancient [[polytheistic]] traditions into the frame of a [[monotheistic]] faith. He suggests that the Hebrew term \"the destroying angel\" actually refers to the Canaanite god Reshep, and that the site of [[Bethel]] (which is Hebrew for \"house of God\") actually deals with a pagan god, who he claims is present in extra-biblical sources. This was one of the aspects of the ancient biblical angelology in pre-exilic times. He suggests that the Septuagint, in Gen 32: 2-3 and Deut 32: 8-9, 43, provides evidence of this possible change in Hebrew paradigms. If true, he claims that such a polytheistic origin of the belief in angels could explain why passages of Scripture attributed to D and P (two proposed partial content sources for the [[Pentateuch]]) silence all mentions of angels. Both [[Qoheleth]] and the [[Sadducees]] later developed an aversion to believing in angels; however, by that time, a full-fledged angelology was developing amidst [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] circles.\n\n2a. '''The Religion of Ancient Israel and the Text of the Hebrew Bible'''. Over the years, Rof\u00e9 has dedicated quite a few articles to the question of how far the development of the Israelite religion affected the transmission of the Biblical text. In the wake of scholars such as [[Abraham Geiger|A. Geiger]] and I.L. Seeligmann, Rof\u00e9 suggested that textual corrections due to the following tenets may have taken place:\n(1) the unification of worship in [[Jerusalem]]\n(2) enhancing the observance of the [[Torah]]\n(3) obliteration of the epithet SEBA'OT from God's name\n(4) rejection of pillars as cultic objects\n(5) negation of the possibility that [[God]] hates Israel\n(6) deference to Israel's dignitaries and aversion to the wicked.\n\nThe study of these corrections contributes to understanding the beliefs of the scribes that transmitted the Biblical books in the first generations after their composition.\n\n2b. Another aspect of '''textual criticism''' is its contact with the history of Biblical literature.  Rof\u00e9 emphasized that these two realms are interdependent. Thus he argued, on the basis of literary-stylistic considerations, that in [[Deuteronomy]] 5 the shorter text presented by the tefillin from [[Qumran]] should be preferred over against all other textual witnesses. In [[Joshua]] 20, arguments derived from [[higher criticism]] (i.e., the discipline that defines and dates sundry documents in the Biblical books) proved the superiority of the shorter text witnessed by the [[Septuagint]]. Contrariwise, in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 6  Rof\u00e9 opines that the Massoretic Text (=MT) has the precedence while the Qumran manuscript 4QJudg erroneously skipped vss. 7-10; this too is inferred from the 19th century higher criticism that identified an ancient Elohistic redaction in the Book of Judges.\n\n2c. In the study of the '''Biblical text''' there are no rigid rules.  Rof\u00e9 maintains that the scribes who first copied the inherited works were rather sophisticated. At times, indeed, they piled additions upon their texts, but otherwise they abridged their documents on literary or ideological grounds. In the story of [[David and Goliath]] (1 Samuel 17), there are linguistic and literary arguments for the precedence of the MT over against the shorter one represented by the Septuagint (=LXX). In the book of [[Jeremiah]] the situation is more complex: sometimes the shorter text, represented by the LXX, can be considered as a kind of 'first edition', but more often the shorter text derived from editorial interventions of late scribes, who operated according to their literary and theological conceptions. On these issues  Rof\u00e9 differed from the views of his colleague [[Emanuel Tov]].\n\n2d. The study of '''[[theological]] views in the Bible''' led Rof\u00e9 to the identification of secondary, midrashic elements in the textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible. These elements are evident in short glosses, appended to [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 2: 3 in a Qumran scroll, [[1 Kings]] 22:28 in the MT and [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 4: 11 in the LXX. But in addition Rof\u00e9 pointed out [[midrashic]] elaborations that affected a whole biblical book. This is the case of the Qumran scroll 4Q51, usually designated as 4QSama. Rof\u00e9 highlighted the various midrashic elements in this manuscript and thereby inferred that one should not define this scroll as representing the book of [[Samuel]]; rather it is an ancient [[Midrash Samuel]]. Here Rof\u00e9 differed with F.M. Cross and his students from the Harvard School.\n\n3. The [[Documentary Hypothesis]] and the Composition of the [[Pentateuch]]. A study of the religious thought in the Torah entails taking a stand vis-\u00e0-vis the Documentary Hypothesis. This happened to Rof\u00e9 in his study of the belief in angels. In his opinion, there is no reason to contest the existence of the major documents in the Pentateuch \u2013 D, produced by the Deuteronomic writers, and P, created in the Priestly school. However, the bulk of the narrative material cannot be subdivided as usual between the four putative documents, J, E, D, P. An instructive case in point is the story of [[Balaam]] in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 22: 2 \u2013 24: 25. He proposed that the story was not composed by the fusion of the accounts of the documents J and E. Rather, he claims that the story of Balaam was based on a legend that grew up gradually and organically. He hypothesized that the speeches of Numbers 24 which presented Balaam as one \"who knows the knowledge of the Most High\" actually were written first, and the incident involving an angel, Balaam, and his donkey (Numbers 22: 22-35) came later. Also, a study of the Betrothal of [[Rebecca|Rebekkah]] (Genesis 24) led him to similar conclusions: he claims that the story is not part of the hypothetical document J, but an independent piece; it is a paradigm composed in post-exilic times in order to teach the people of Judea the proper choice in match-making. See below, at paragraph 6, for further stories of this kind.\n\n4a. '''The Prophetical Stories''': The Narratives about the Prophets in the Hebrew Bible \u2013 Their Literary Types and History (Hebrew: 1982, 1986; English: 1988). In the ten chapters of this book Rof\u00e9 summarized eighteen years of study, between 1964 and 1982. This is a first effort in Biblical research to present a comprehensive description of all the stories about the prophets, defining their genres, such as [[legend]], [[biography]], [[historiography]], [[parables]], and determining the  origin of the genres and their subsequent development. The legenda, for instance, came into being among the admirers of [[Elisha]], around the end of the 9th century BCE. The parable appeared when the disciples of the prophets began to discuss the nature of the prophets' mission and of the word of the Lord pronounced by them. This genre was probably created in late pre-exilic and early post-exilic times. The climax of the prophetical stories is the epopee about [[Elijah]] and the Lord's fight against Baal. In its last phases, the prophetical narrative described its heroes as martyrs who taught foreigners the omnipotence of the god of Israel.\n\n4b. '''The theological discussion about the essence of prophecy'''. The quality of the word of the Lord engaged the disciples of the prophets for a long time in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Is the word of the Lord always fulfilled? The question was raised and received a positive answer in an addition to the law concerning prophecy in Deut 18: 21-22. The same view transpires from the Deuteronomistic redaction of the book of Kings and is proclaimed by Deutero-Isaiah. The opposite stand was taken by the author of Jonah, by the Deuteronomistic editor of Jeremiah, and an editor of [[Ezekiel]] (Ch. 33). Trito-Isaiah joined them while contesting the views of his master, Deutero-Isaiah. The identification of this divergence led Rof\u00e9 to define anew the border between the words of Deutero-and Trito-Isaiah. To the former one should attribute chs. 40-53, to the latter \u2013 chs. 54-66. Indeed, Abraham Kuenen suggested this as early as 1886.\n\n5. '''The Introduction to [[Deuteronomy]]''': Part I and Further Chapters (Hebrew: 1988) grew out of notes distributed to students of Bible at the Hebrew University in the wake of the [[Yom Kippur war]] (1973), because of the teacher's and the students' absence from classes. This Introduction attempts at describing the contents of Deuteronomy and its structure which mainly consists of two covenants: Horeb (4:44 - 28:68 + 30: 1 - 10) and the one in the Land of Moab (28: 69 \u2013 30: 20). The latter covenant has a clear affinity to vassal treaties, mainly Hittite, of the Second Millennium BCE.  Rof\u00e9s enquiry, however, is principally not comparative, but internal; it seeks to uncover the history of Deuteronomy, especially its legal corpus, by dwelling on its duplications and contradictions. Thus the various layers have been exposed: first, prae-Deuteronomic inherited material, then Deuteronomic legislation that preceded the [[Josiah]] reform of 622 BCE, further an additional, later layer from the time of the reform itself, finally a post-reform layer that supplemented and interpreted the earlier legislation. This kind of work reached into post-exilic times.  Rof\u00e9s study confirms the conclusion, already expressed by former scholars, that the ultimate origin of  the Deuteronomic movement was in the ancient holy site of [[Shechem]], probably in the 10th century BCE. A significant portion of this research has been published in English: Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretation (Edinburgh 2002).\n\n6. '''The Introduction to the Literature of the Hebrew Bible''' (Hebrew: 2006, 2007; English: 2009).  As usual in books of introduction, this work does not strive for innovations, but attempts at describing the problems brought to light by the discipline and the methods applied to solve them. The particular merit of this Introduction is that it does not merely present the conclusions reached by the Biblical research, but it shows the course that led to them. For instance, Part 3 \"The Prophetic Literature\" poses some fundamental questions: Did the disciples of the prophets introduce additions into the words of their masters? Did they rework them? What are the proofs to their interventions? How can one distinguish between prophecy and apocalyptic?  Part 4, \"Psalmody\", not only summarized the method of Hermann Gunkel, but also criticized it; the same was done with his main detractor, Meir Weiss. A peculiarity of this introduction is its chapter \"Late Narrative\" (Part I, Chapter 4). Here  Rof\u00e9 brought together findings from his previous studies. Signs of late composition clearly indicate that the stories about the betrothal of Rebekkah (Genesis 24), the rape of [[Dinah]] (Genesis 34), David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17), the wars with [[Aram Damascus|Aram]] (1 Kings 20), the vineyard of [[Naboth]] (1 Kings 21: 1-16) were all written in post-exilic times. They reflect problems and expectations of the people of Yehud  in Persian times. These findings run against the Documentary Hypothesis in the Pentateuch and the hypothesis of a single Deuteronomistic composition from Deuteronomy 1 to 2 Kings 25. The creation of the Biblical literature was a multifarious process that extended over a longer span than the one usually accepted in Biblical criticism.\n\n==Publications==\n\n=== Books ===\nThe Prophetical Stories (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1988);Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretation (London:Clark & Continuum, 2002); Introduction to the Literature of the Hebrew Bible (Jerusalem: Simor-Eisenbrauns, 2009);Angels in the Bible: Israelite Belief in Angels as Evidenced by Biblicl Traditions (Hebrew; Jerusalem: Carmel 2012).\n\n===Articles by subject===\n{{Navbox\n|navbar     = plain\n|title      = The Composition of Biblical Literature\n|state      = collapsed\n|list1      = \n#\"Joshua 20: Historico-Literary Criticism Illustrated\", ''Empirical Models for Biblical Criticism'', ed. by J.H.
