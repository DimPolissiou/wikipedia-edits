The code is hosted on [[GitHub]].<ref>[https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j source code]</ref> A support forum is maintained on [[Gitter]].<ref>[https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j Gitter Support Channel]</ref>\n\nThe framework is composable, meaning shallow neural nets such as restricted Boltzmann machines, convolutional nets, autoencoders, and recurrent nets can be added to one another to create deep nets of varying types. It also has extensive visualization tools,<ref>[http://deeplearning4j.org/visualization Deeplearning4j Visualization Tools]</ref> and a computation graph.<ref>[http://deeplearning4j.org/compgraph Deeplearning4j Computation Graph]</ref>\n\n==Distributed==\nTraining with Deeplearning4j occurs in a cluster. Neural nets are trained in parallel via iterative reduce, which works on [[Hadoop]]-YARN and on [[Apache Spark|Spark]].<ref name=\"deeplearning4j.org\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/emsixteeen/IterativeReduce|title=Iterative reduce|date=15 March 2020}}</ref> Deeplearning4j also integrates with CUDA kernels to conduct pure GPU operations, and works with distributed GPUs.\n\n==Scientific computing for the JVM==\nDeeplearning4j includes an n-dimensional array class using [[ND4J (software)|ND4J]] that allows scientific computing in Java and Scala, similar to the functions that [[NumPy]] provides to [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It's effectively based on a library for [[linear algebra]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulation in a production environment.\n\n==DataVec vectorization library for machine-learning==\nDataVec vectorizes various file formats and data types using an [[input/output]] format system similar to Hadoop's use of MapReduce; that is, it turns various data types into columns of scalars termed [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]]. DataVec is designed to vectorize CSVs, images, sound, text, video, and time series.<ref>[http://deeplearning4j.org/datavec DataVec ETL for Machine Learning]</ref><ref>[https://www.infoq.com/articles/deep-learning-time-series-anomaly-detection Anomaly Detection for Time Series Data with Deep Learning]</ref>\n\n==Text and NLP==\nDeeplearning4j includes a [[vector space model]]ing and [[topic model]]ing toolkit, implemented in Java and integrating with parallel GPUs for performance. It is designed to handle large text sets.\n\nDeeplearning4j includes implementations of term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency ([[tf\u2013idf]]), [[deep learning]], and Mikolov's word2vec algorithm,<ref>[https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ word2vec]</ref> doc2vec, and GloVe, reimplemented and optimized in Java.

[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, what is now called [[Torres Strait]] and associated islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain. He returned to [[London]] with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in [[Sydney,  New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island.

Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored).

The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill to the voters of the four colonies and Queensland, and the Bill was endorsed.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nIn March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, where approval for the Bill was sought from the Imperial Parliament. The Bill was put to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and passed on 5 July 1900 and, soon after, was signed into law by [[Queen Victoria]]. [[Lord Hopetoun]] was dispatched from London, tasked with appointing an interim Cabinet to oversee the foundation of the Commonwealth and conduct of the first elections.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nThere was a more radical vision for a separate Australia by some colonists, including writer [[Henry Lawson]], trade unionist [[William Lane]] and as found in the pages of the Sydney ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|Bulletin]]''. But by the end of 1899, and after much colonial debate, the citizens of five of the six Australian colonies had voted in referendums in favour of a constitution to form a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]].

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

(This is not to say that 81.9 per cent of women were working but that 7.9 per cent of the women interested/looking for work were unable to find it, a much lower figure than maybe first thought, as many women stayed home and were not in the job force in those years, especially if they were unable to find work.)\n\nIn the working class suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], 41.3 per cent of men and 20.7 per cent of women were listed as unemployed.<ref>Spearritt cited in Henry Pook (1993) pp. 211\u201312.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".

The movements to end Australia's involvement gathered strength after the [[Tet Offensive]] of early 1968 and compulsory national service (selected by ballot) became increasingly unpopular. In the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 elections]], the government hung on despite a significant decline in popularity.

In November 1970 [[1st Australian Task Force]] was reduced to two battalions and in November 1971, 1ATF was withdrawn from Vietnam.

According to McIntyre, that interpretation has been largely abandoned by recent scholars:\n:The process of settlement is now regarded as a violent invasion of a rich and subtle indigenous culture, the colonists' material practices as destructive of a fragile environment, their aesthetic response to it blinkered and prejudiced, the cultivation of some British forms timid and unresponsive.<ref>McIntyre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&pg=PA164 online p 164]</ref>\n\nThe first major history of Australia was William Charles Wentworth's ''Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales, and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land: With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration, and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America'' (1819).<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00068.html online]</ref> Wentworth details the disastrous effects the penal regime.

[[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived on the Australian mainland by sea from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. The [[Indigenous Australian art|artistic]], [[Indigenous Australian music|musical]] and [[Dreamtime|spiritual]] traditions they established are among the longest surviving such traditions in human history.\n\nThe first known landing in Australia by Europeans was in 1606 by Dutch navigator [[Willem Janszoon]]. Later that year, Spanish explorer [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]] sailed through, and navigated, what is now called [[Torres Strait]] and associated islands.<ref>Brett Hilder (1980) ''The Voyage of Torres''. University of Queensland Press, St. Lucia, Queensland. {{ISBN|0-7022-1275-X}}</ref> Twenty-nine other Dutch navigators explored the western and southern coasts in the 17th century and dubbed the continent [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. [[Makassan contact with Australia|Macassan trepangers]] visited Australia's northern coasts after 1720, possibly earlier. Other European explorers followed until, in 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] charted the east coast of [[Australia]] for Great Britain. He returned to [[London]] with accounts favouring colonization at [[Botany Bay]] (now in [[Sydney,  New South Wales]].\n\nA [[First Fleet]] of British ships arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788<ref>[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis]], Balderstone and Bowan (2006) p. 25</ref> to establish a [[penal colony]], the first colony on the Australian mainland. In the century that followed, the British established other colonies on the continent, and [[European land exploration of Australia|European explorers]] ventured into its interior. [[Indigenous Australians]] were greatly weakened and their numbers diminished by introduced diseases and conflict with the colonists during this period.\n\n[[Australian gold rushes|Gold rushes]] and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural industries]] brought prosperity. Autonomous [[parliamentary democracies]] began to be established throughout the six British colonies from the mid-19th century. The colonies voted by [[referendum]] to unite in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901, and modern Australia came into being. Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two [[world war]]s and became a long-standing [[ANZUS|ally of the United States]] when threatened by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]]. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014, and sustains the world's 12th largest national economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |title=DFAT.gov.au |publisher=DFAT.gov.au |date=19 April 1984 |accessdate=27 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216000834/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html |archive-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Aboriginal Australia==\n{{Main|History of Indigenous Australians}}\n{{See also|Prehistory of Australia|Aboriginal history of Western Australia}}\n\n=== Early Indigenous prehistory ===\n[[File:Aboriginal Art Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rock painting at Ubirr in [[Kakadu National Park]].

Many new arrivals were also sick or unfit for work and the conditions of healthy convicts only deteriorated with hard labour and poor sustenance in the settlement. The food situation reached crisis point in 1790 and the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] which finally arrived in June 1790 had lost a quarter of its 'passengers' through sickness, while the condition of the convicts of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] appalled Phillip; however, from 1791 the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of trade lessened the feeling of isolation and improved supplies.<ref name=\"HttpadbonlineanueduaubiogsAbhtmhiliteArthurPhillip\">{{cite book |author=B.H.

This left Sydney Cove only as an important port and focus of social life. Poor equipment and unfamiliar soils and climate continued to hamper the expansion of farming from Farm Cove to Parramatta and [[Toongabbie]], but a building programme, assisted by convict labour, advanced steadily. Between 1788 and 1792, convicts and their gaolers made up the majority of the population\u2014but after this, a population of emancipated convicts began to grow who could be granted land and these people pioneered a non-government private sector economy and were later joined by soldiers whose military service had expired\u2014and finally, free settlers who began arriving from Britain.

The western boundary of 135\u00b0 East of Greenwich was based on the ''Complete Map of the Southern Continent'', published in [[Emanuel Bowen]]'s ''Complete System of Geography'' (London 1747), and reproduced in John Campbell's editions of John Harris' ''Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels'' (1744\u201348, and 1764). Bowen's map was based on one by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] and published in ''Relations des Divers Voyages'' (1663), which apparently divided ''New Holland'' in the west from ''Terra Australis'' in the east by a latitude staff situated at 135\u00b0 East. This division, reproduced in Bowen's map, provided a convenient western boundary for the British claim because, as Watkin Tench subsequently commented in ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', \"By this partition, it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between the Dutch and us, will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English navigators only are comprized in this territory\".<ref>Watkin Tench, ''A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay'', London, Debrett, April 1789, p. 67.</ref> Th\u00e9venot said he copied his map from the one engraved in the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, but in that map there was no dividing line between New Holland and Terra Australis. Th\u00e9venot's map was actually copied from [[Joan Blaeu]]'s map, ''Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus'', published in 1659 in the ''Kurf\u00fcrsten Atlas'' (Atlas of the Great Elector); this map was a part of Blaeu's world map of 1648, ''Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula'', which first showed the land revealed by [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 voyage as ''Hollandia Nova'' and which served as the basis for the Amsterdam Town Hall pavement map.<ref>Kees Zandvliet, \"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, ''Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore'', Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67\u201384; National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, ''Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p. 32.</ref> Longitude 135\u00b0 East reflected the line of division between the claims of Spain and Portugal established in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494, which had formed the basis of many subsequent claims to colonial territory.

It was hoped that the giant [[Norfolk Island pine]] trees and flax plants growing wild on the island might provide the basis for a local industry which, particularly in the case of flax, would provide an alternative source of supply to Russia for an article which was essential for making cordage and sails for the ships of the British navy; however, the island had no safe harbour, which led the colony to be abandoned and the settlers evacuated to Tasmania in 1807.<ref>King, Robert J. \"Norfolk Island: Phantasy and Reality, 1770\u20131814.\" ''The Great Circle'', Vol. 25, No. 2, 2003, pp. 20\u201341.</ref> The island was subsequently re-settled as a penal settlement in 1824.\n\nIn 1798, [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island.

Other British settlements followed, at various points around the continent, many of them unsuccessful. The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and [[James Bremer|Captain J.J.G. Bremer]], RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]] and the [[Cobourg Peninsula]]. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at [[Fort Dundas]] on [[Melville Island (Australia)|Melville Island]] in 1824 and, because this was well to the west of the boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129\u00b0 East.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series III, Vol. V, 1922, pp. 743\u201347, 770.</ref>\n\nThe new boundary included Melville and Bathurst Islands, and the adjacent mainland. In 1826, the British claim was extended to the whole Australian continent when Major [[Edmund Lockyer]] established a settlement on [[King George Sound]] (the basis of the later town of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]), but the eastern border of Western Australia remained unchanged at longitude 129\u00b0 East. In 1824, a penal colony was established near the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]] (the basis of the later colony of [[Queensland]]). In 1829, the [[Swan River Colony]] and its capital of [[Perth]] were founded on the west coast proper and also assumed control of King George Sound. Initially a free colony, Western Australia later accepted British convicts, because of an acute labour shortage.\n\nThe colony of South Australia was settled in 1836, with its western and eastern boundaries set at 132\u00b0 and 141\u00b0 East of Greenwich, and to the north at latitude 26\u00b0 South.<ref>''Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia'', in Brian Dickey and Peter Howell, ''South Australia's Foundation: Select Documents'', Adelaide, Wakefield Press Netley, 1986, p. 75</ref> The western and eastern boundary points were chosen as they marked the extent of coastline first surveyed by Matthew Flinders in 1802 ([[Nicolas Baudin]]'s priority being ignored).

The following year, the [[1891 National Australasian Convention]] was held in Sydney, with all the future states and New Zealand represented. A draft Constitutional Bill was produced by the Constitution Committee, chiefly drafted by [[Samuel Griffith]], with Inglis Clark and Charles Kingston, as well as the assistance of [[Edmund Barton]]. The delegates returned to their parliaments with the Bill, but progress was slow, as Australia faced its 1890s economic Depression. Nevertheless, by 1895 five of the colonies elected representatives for a second [[1897-8 Australian Constitutional Convention|Convention]], which was conducted in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne over the space of a year, allowing time for consultation. The Constitution Committee this time appointed Barton, Richard O'Connor and John Downer to draft a Bill and after much debate, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania adopted the Bill to be put to their voters. Queensland and Western Australia later moved to do the same, though New Zealand did not participate in the Convention.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\">Michael Meek; ''LBC Nutshell: The Australian Legal System''; 3rd Edition; 1999.</ref>\n\nIn July 1898, the Bill was put to a series of referenda in four colonies, but New South Wales rejected the proposal. In 1899, a second referendum put an amended Bill to the voters of the four colonies and Queensland, and the Bill was endorsed.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nIn March 1900, delegates were dispatched to London, where approval for the Bill was sought from the Imperial Parliament. The Bill was put to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and passed on 5 July 1900 and, soon after, was signed into law by [[Queen Victoria]]. [[Lord Hopetoun]] was dispatched from London, tasked with appointing an interim Cabinet to oversee the foundation of the Commonwealth and conduct of the first elections.<ref name=\"Michael Meek 1999\"/>\n\nThere was a more radical vision for a separate Australia by some colonists, including writer [[Henry Lawson]], trade unionist [[William Lane]] and as found in the pages of the Sydney ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|Bulletin]]''. But by the end of 1899, and after much colonial debate, the citizens of five of the six Australian colonies had voted in referendums in favour of a constitution to form a [[Federation of Australia|Federation]].

In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the [[Governor of New South Wales]], [[Philip Game]], had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury.

The Prime Minister, Joseph Lyons, favoured the tough economic measures of the Premiers' Plan, pursued an orthodox fiscal policy and refused to accept the proposals of the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, to default on overseas debt repayments. According to author [[Anne Henderson]] of the [[Sydney Institute]], Lyons held a steadfast belief in \"the need to balance budgets, lower costs to business and restore confidence\" and the Lyons period gave Australia \"stability and eventual growth\" between the drama of the Depression and the outbreak of the Second World War. A lowering of wages was enforced and industry tariff protections maintained, which together with cheaper raw materials during the 1930s saw a shift from agriculture to manufacturing as the chief employer of the Australian economy\u2014a shift which was consolidated by increased investment by the commonwealth government into defence and armaments manufacture.

(This is not to say that 81.9 per cent of women were working but that 7.9 per cent of the women interested/looking for work were unable to find it, a much lower figure than maybe first thought, as many women stayed home and were not in the job force in those years, especially if they were unable to find work.)\n\nIn the working class suburb of [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], 41.3 per cent of men and 20.7 per cent of women were listed as unemployed.<ref>Spearritt cited in Henry Pook (1993) pp. 211\u201312.

At the 1937 elections, both political parties advocated increased defence spending, in the context of increased Japanese aggression in China and Germany's aggression in Europe; however, there was a difference in opinion over how the defence spending should be allocated. The [[United Australia Party]] government emphasised co-operation with Britain in \"a policy of imperial defence\".

The movements to end Australia's involvement gathered strength after the [[Tet Offensive]] of early 1968 and compulsory national service (selected by ballot) became increasingly unpopular. In the [[1969 Australian federal election|1969 elections]], the government hung on despite a significant decline in popularity.

In November 1970 [[1st Australian Task Force]] was reduced to two battalions and in November 1971, 1ATF was withdrawn from Vietnam.

According to McIntyre, that interpretation has been largely abandoned by recent scholars:\n:The process of settlement is now regarded as a violent invasion of a rich and subtle indigenous culture, the colonists' material practices as destructive of a fragile environment, their aesthetic response to it blinkered and prejudiced, the cultivation of some British forms timid and unresponsive.<ref>McIntyre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2G63IrFXpgC&pg=PA164 online p 164]</ref>\n\nThe first major history of Australia was William Charles Wentworth's ''Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales, and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land: With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration, and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America'' (1819).<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks/e00068.html online]</ref> Wentworth details the disastrous effects the penal regime.

Nearly all passenger traffic and some intrastate freight operates on {{track gauge|victorian|allk=on}}, while all interstate and much intrastate freight traffic operates on {{track gauge|sg|allk=on}}. As a consequence, freight and passenger operations are almost completely segregated in the metropolitan area.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|p=34}}\n\nMost suburban passenger lines operated by the metropolitan rail franchisee, currently [[Metro Trains Melbourne]], are [[Electrification (rail)|electrified]] with 1500 [[volt|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[overhead catenary]].

From this central core, nearly all tracks pass through the three major junction stations of [[North Melbourne railway station|North Melbourne]], [[Jolimont railway station|Jolimont]], and [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]]; and from there extend outwards to the west, north-east and east of the city respectively. There are few connections between the radial lines outside of the central city.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|p=35}} Capital investment in the network since 1990 has focused on relieving \"bottlenecks\" near the central core caused by the large number of lines converging, most significantly with the [[Regional Rail Link]] project which provided additional capacity between [[Sunshine railway station, Melbourne|Sunshine]] and the city.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n[[File:Melbourne-signalling-stanchions.jpg|thumb|Quadruple track near [[Caulfield railway station|Caulfield station]], showing [[railway signalling|signalling]] and [[overhead lines#Overhead catenary|overhead wiring]]]]\nMuch of the metropolitan network is [[Double-track railway|double track]] or multiple pairs of tracks. There are small sections of [[Triple-track railway|triple track]], which are used to allow express trains to overtake stopping trains in peak hour. Nearly the entirety of the [[Altona railway line, Melbourne|Altona]], [[Cranbourne railway line|Cranbourne]] and Stony Point branches are single track, and many of the outer suburban passenger lines also have sections of single track, usually where demand for frequent services is low.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|p=36}}\n\nThe metropolitan network has a large number of [[level crossings]]. Many have been gradually removed by [[grade separation|grade separating]] road and rail traffic: by 2016, some 228 grade separations had been undertaken in the Melbourne area, leaving 170 level crossings, although very few projects of this nature had been undertaken in the latter half of the 20th century.

The system consists of:\n* The control system, situated at [[Metrol, Melbourne rail network|Metrol]].\n* Control stations, at which staff update information, and announcements and CCTV recordings are dealt with for nearby stations.\n* [[Public address]] systems at each station on the network. The PRIDE system automatically announces when a train is due soon, delayed, or cancelled; this is done via the rail telephone network.\n* PRIDE \"talking boxes\" installed on each platform of all stations.\n* Electronic information displays.\n\nControl data comes from two locations: Metrol, and control stations. Next train data and times are automatically updated by the train control systems, with manual overrides also possible.\n\nAll stations are provided with \"talking boxes\" which have two buttons and a small [[loudspeaker|speaker]].\nThe green button, when pressed, contacts the PRIDE controller over the rail telephone network, identifying itself by the [[dual-tone multi-frequency|DTMF]] tones that correspond to the ID number assigned to the box. The system then reads out times and destinations for the next two services to depart that platform (or, in the case of stations with a single island platform with departures either side, both platforms). The red button when pressed, gives the user two way communication with the closest control station.\n\nBusy stations are often provided with an electronic [[light-emitting diode|LED]] {{Tooltip|PID|Passenger Information Display}}s, which indicate the destination, time, stopping pattern summary, and minutes to departure for the next train on the platform.\n\nStations on the [[City Loop]], in addition to [[North Melbourne railway station|North Melbourne]], [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]], and [[Box Hill railway station, Melbourne|Box Hill]] stations, have [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen {{Tooltip|PID|Passenger Information Display}}s, although some of these have recently been replaced by [[widescreen]] [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens. These displays show in detail the destination, scheduled and actual departure time, and all stations the next train stops at. Also shown is the destination and time of the following train, and the system is capable of providing suggested connections and warn of service interruptions.\n\nOn Sunday, 26 September 2010, the PRIDE system was upgraded with new voice announcements. The voice is now female, and now advises to touch on and off when using Myki.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Trains go female|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgr0STnslIA|work=Video|accessdate=28 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Bayside Rail Upgrade, stations on the [[Frankston railway line|Frankston line]] will receive new \"network status boards\". These LCD screens provide travel information on all of Melbournes 16 railway lines as well as tram & bus services, including delays, replacement services or planned disruptions.<ref>[http://ptv.vic.gov.au/projects/rail-projects/bayside-rail-project/network-status-boards/ Network Status Boards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915072650/http://ptv.vic.gov.au/projects/rail-projects/bayside-rail-project/network-status-boards/ |date=15 September 2014 }} Public Transport Victoria</ref>\n\n=== Safeworking ===\n[[File:Signal-and-train-stop-melbourne.jpg|thumb|A signal with associated train stop in the raised position to the right]]\n\nMost lines in Melbourne operate under an automatic block system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits [[Railway signal|signals]] to operate automatically with the passage of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from [[signal box]]es, with [[interlocking]]s used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The [[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse line]] has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.\n\nThe outer end of the [[Hurstbridge railway line|Hurstbridge line]] used to be operated with [[Token (railway signalling)|token based systems]] and two-position manual signalling, where access to the line is based upon possession of a token. It was dismantled in 2013.\n\n[[Train stop]]s are used to enforce stop indications on signals\u2014should a train pass a signal, the train's brakes will automatically be applied. Trains are also fitted with [[pilot valve]]s, a form of [[dead man's switch]] that applies the brakes should the driver fail to maintain a foot or hand pilot valve in a set position.<ref name=\"safe\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/Doi/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/0C6245228F9F50A3CA2570AE0012723F?OpenDocument\n |title       = Rail system safety\n |work        = Department of Infrastructure website\n |accessdate  = 22 December 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090520043834/http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/0C6245228F9F50A3CA2570AE0012723F?OpenDocument\n |archivedate = 20 May 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The \"VICERS\" [[Dead-man's vigilance device|vigilance control]] and [[event recorder]] system is also being currently fitted to suburban trains to provide an additional level of safety.<ref name=\"safe\" />\n\n=== Train control ===\nThe main control room for the rail network is [[Metrol, Melbourne rail network|Metrol]].

All fleet types have used these classifications, with different fleet types using different number ranges for the carriages.\n\n*'''M''' indicates a motorised carriage, with a driving compartment.\n*'''T''' indicates a trailer carriage.\n*'''D''' indicated a trailer carriage with a driving compartment. Only Swing-door, Tait, and Hitachi trains had these.\n*'''G''' indicated a trailer carriage fitted with both gas and electric lighting, for use on country services. Only Tait trains had these.\n*'''BT''' indicated a second class trailer carriage. Prior to the abolition of first class suburban travel in 1958, motorised carriage were generally second class and trailer carriages were generally first class.\n\nAn exception to the above classifications was the [[4D (train)|trial double-deck]] train, which used '''T''' to indicate a trailer carriage with a driving compartment, and '''M''' to indicate a motorised carriage without a driving compartment.\n\nCurrently, all trains are assembled into a symmetrical '''M-T-M''' arrangement. Trains comprise either one or two such units. All peak period services and some off-peak services comprise two units. The now retired [[Hitachi (Australian train)|Hitachi]] trains operated in fixed two-unit sets.\n\n=== Lines ===\nMelbourne's suburban network includes 16 electrified lines and 1 non-electrified line.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many lines have been lengthened over time, most notably the [[Mernda railway line|Mernda line]] from [[Epping railway station, Melbourne|Epping]] to [[South Morang railway station|South Morang]] in 2012 and again to [[Mernda railway station|Mernda]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/projects/mernda-rail-extension-project|title=Mernda rail extension project {{!}} Level Crossing Removal Authority|website=levelcrossings.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Lines have also changed terminus or layout, including the forthcoming changes to the Cranbourne, Pakenham and Sunbury lines as part of the [[Melbourne Metro Rail Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/projects/rail-projects/Works-to-transform-the-Cranbourne-Pakenham-corridor/|title=Works to transform the Cranbourne Pakenham corridor|website=www.ptv.vic.gov.au|language=English|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Numerous [[Proposed Melbourne rail extensions|proposals for new lines or extensions]] not yet constructed have been made, including the long-outstanding [[Doncaster railway line]] and [[Melbourne Airport rail link]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/turnbull-puts-up-5bn-for-melbourne-airport-rail-link|title=Turnbull puts up $5bn for Melbourne airport rail link|last=Davey|first=Melissa|date=2018-04-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==== Electrified lines ====\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Alamein railway line]]\n*[[Belgrave railway line]]\n*[[Craigieburn railway line]]\n*[[Cranbourne railway line]]\n*[[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse/Showgrounds railway line]]\n*[[Frankston railway line]]\n*[[Glen Waverley railway line]]\n*[[Hurstbridge railway line]]\n*[[Lilydale railway line]]\n*[[Mernda railway line]]\n*[[Pakenham railway line]]\n*[[Sandringham railway line]]\n*[[Sunbury railway line]]\n*[[Upfield railway line]]\n*[[Werribee railway line]]\n*[[Williamstown railway line]]\n*[[City Loop]] (incorporated into several other lines)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==== Non-electrified lines ====\n*[[Deer Park\u2013West Werribee railway line]] (non-electrified train service operated by V/Line)\n*[[Melton railway line]] (non-electrified train service operated by V/Line)\n*[[Stony Point railway line]] (non-electrified train service beyond Frankston)\n\n===== Stony Point line and metropolitan V/Line services =====\n[[Stony Point railway line|Stony Point]] line services operate as shuttles from [[Frankston railway station|Frankston]] station with passengers to and from [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street]] required to change trains. It is the only non-electrified line operated by Metro Trains, with services being operated using [[V/Line Sprinter|Sprinter]] diesel multiple units leased from [[V/Line]].\n\n[[Melton railway line|Melton (Ballarat line)]] and [[Deer Park\u2013West Werribee railway line|Wyndham Vale (Geelong line)]] services are operated by [[V/Line]] and depart from [[Southern Cross railway station|Southern Cross]], but are within the metropolitan ticketing zone. Bacchus Marsh/Melton/Ballarat trains stop at Rockbank, Caroline Springs, Deer Park and Ardeer. Wyndham Vale/Geelong trains also stop at Ardeer and Deer Park, along with Tarneit. Only Wyndham Vale and Ballarat trains stop at Ardeer, not Geelong trains.\n\n5 morning peak and 3 afternoon peak trains operate to and from Wyndham Vale. One weekday morning service and numerous football services operate to Wyndham Vale.\n\nFrequent peak hour trains operate to and from Bacchus Marsh and Melton. Since 2015, weekday hourly trains have also operated to Bacchus Marsh. On top of Ballarat trains stopping here, Bacchus Marsh residents have half hourly services to the city.\n\nOn weekdays, Geelong and Ballarat trains run express after Tarneit and Melton respectively, with Wyndham Vale, Bacchus Marsh and Melton trains stopping between Rockbank and Sunshine. On weekends, these stations are serviced by Ballarat trains.\n\nSunbury services used to also be operated by V/Line until 2012 when the electrical network was extended to Sunbury and these trains also stopped at Diggers Rest; Sunbury passengers can still catch V/Line trains to or from Bendigo. The redundant carriages were moved onto Bacchus Marsh services instead. V/Line trains used to also operate to Donnybrook, stopping at Craigieburn but since the electrical network was extended to Craigieburn in 2007, trains have stopped terminating at Donnybrook.\n\n=== Service patterns ===\n{{main|Metro Trains Melbourne#Service patterns}}\nSuburban services are operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]]. Railway lines and service patterns are often classified into groups, which are:\n*Burnley group\n**[[Lilydale railway line|Lilydale]], [[Belgrave railway line|Belgrave]], [[Alamein railway line|Alamein]] and [[Glen Waverley railway line|Glen Waverley]] line (blue)\n*Caulfield group\n**[[Pakenham railway line|Pakenham]] and [[Cranbourne railway line|Cranbourne]] line (light blue)\n**[[Sandringham railway line|Sandringham]] line (pink)\n*Clifton Hill group\n**[[Mernda railway line|Mernda]] and [[Hurstbridge railway line|Hurstbridge]] line (red)\n*Northern group\n**[[Sunbury railway line|Sunbury]], [[Craigieburn railway line|Craigieburn]] and [[Upfield railway line|Upfield]] line (yellow)\n*Cross-City group\n**[[Frankston railway line|Frankston]], [[Werribee railway line|Werribee]] and [[Williamstown railway line|Williamstown]] line (green)\n**[[Stony Point railway line|Stony Point]] line (non-electrified train service beyond Frankston)\n*Special event services\n**[[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse/Showgrounds]]\n\nMost of the above lines travel along the [[City Loop]], and as some trains change to service other lines at their terminus, others may run through the City Loop incidentally. The Frankston line does not travel along the City Loop on off-peak weekdays, but does so during the peak and weekends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/maps/metropolitan-trains/view/6/|title=Metropolitan trains|website=www.ptv.vic.gov.au|language=English|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne uses [[clock-face scheduling]] in off-peak periods, but generally not in [[rush hour]], due to the network operating near to infrastructure capacity and having to accommodate single-line sections, flat junctions, and regional diesel-hauled trains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/metro-warns-of-capacity-crunch-within-two-years-on-some-train-lines-20170704-gx4giy.html|title=Metro warns of capacity crunch within two years on some train lines|last=Carey|first=Adam|date=2017-07-04|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Frequencies vary according to time of day, day of week and by line.

Prior to December 2012 Melbourne also used a magnetic strip [[paper ticket]] system known as the [[Metcard]], first introduced to the railway network in 1996. On 29 December 2012 Metcard was no longer available for use on Melbourne's public transport and completely replaced by myki. Multi-modal tickets were first introduced in Melbourne in 1969 and prior to this train, tram and bus services all had separated ticketing systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robx1.net/victkt/intro.htm|title=Melbourne's Multi-Modal Based Ticketing Systems 1969 to present|website=www.robx1.net|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Host stations and premium stations ===\nHost stations and premium stations are categories of railway stations on the suburban rail network.

In the inner western suburbs of the city, freight trains operate on dedicated lines, but in other areas freight trains share tracks with the suburban [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] and regional [[V/Line]] passenger services. The majority of freight terminals are located in the inner suburbs around [[Port of Melbourne]], others are located between the Melbourne CBD and Footscray.\n\nUntil the 1980s a number of suburban stations had their own [[rail yard|goods yards]], with freight trains running over the suburban network, often with the [[Victorian Railways E class (electric)|E]] or [[Victorian Railways L class (electric)|L class]] [[electric locomotive]]s.\n\n== Legislation, governance and access ==\n\n=== Key statutes ===\n{{Main|Transport Integration Act}}\n{{See also|Director of Public Transport|V/Line|VicTrack|Transport Act 1983|Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983}}\nThe prime rail statute in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the [[Transport Integration Act]].

Nearly all passenger traffic and some intrastate freight operates on {{track gauge|victorian|allk=on}}, while all interstate and much intrastate freight traffic operates on {{track gauge|sg|allk=on}}. As a consequence, freight and passenger operations are almost completely segregated in the metropolitan area.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|p=34}}\n\nMost suburban passenger lines operated by the metropolitan rail franchisee, currently [[Metro Trains Melbourne]], are [[Electrification (rail)|electrified]] with 1500 [[volt|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[overhead catenary]].

From this central core, nearly all tracks pass through the three major junction stations of [[North Melbourne railway station|North Melbourne]], [[Jolimont railway station|Jolimont]], and [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]]; and from there extend outwards to the west, north-east and east of the city respectively. There are few connections between the radial lines outside of the central city.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|p=35}} Capital investment in the network since 1990 has focused on relieving \"bottlenecks\" near the central core caused by the large number of lines converging, most significantly with the [[Regional Rail Link]] project which provided additional capacity between [[Sunshine railway station, Melbourne|Sunshine]] and the city.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n[[File:Melbourne-signalling-stanchions.jpg|thumb|Quadruple track near [[Caulfield railway station|Caulfield station]], showing [[railway signalling|signalling]] and [[overhead lines#Overhead catenary|overhead wiring]]]]\nMuch of the metropolitan network is [[Double-track railway|double track]] or multiple pairs of tracks. There are small sections of [[Triple-track railway|triple track]], which are used to allow express trains to overtake stopping trains in peak hour. Nearly the entirety of the [[Altona railway line, Melbourne|Altona]], [[Cranbourne railway line|Cranbourne]] and Stony Point branches are single track, and many of the outer suburban passenger lines also have sections of single track, usually where demand for frequent services is low.{{sfn|BITRE|2012|p=36}}\n\nThe metropolitan network has a large number of [[level crossings]]. Many have been gradually removed by [[grade separation|grade separating]] road and rail traffic: by 2016, some 228 grade separations had been undertaken in the Melbourne area, leaving 170 level crossings, although very few projects of this nature had been undertaken in the latter half of the 20th century.

The system consists of:\n* The control system, situated at [[Metrol, Melbourne rail network|Metrol]].\n* Control stations, at which staff update information, and announcements and CCTV recordings are dealt with for nearby stations.\n* [[Public address]] systems at each station on the network. The PRIDE system automatically announces when a train is due soon, delayed, or cancelled; this is done via the rail telephone network.\n* PRIDE \"talking boxes\" installed on each platform of all stations.\n* Electronic information displays.\n\nControl data comes from two locations: Metrol, and control stations. Next train data and times are automatically updated by the train control systems, with manual overrides also possible.\n\nAll stations are provided with \"talking boxes\" which have two buttons and a small [[loudspeaker|speaker]].\nThe green button, when pressed, contacts the PRIDE controller over the rail telephone network, identifying itself by the [[dual-tone multi-frequency|DTMF]] tones that correspond to the ID number assigned to the box. The system then reads out times and destinations for the next two services to depart that platform (or, in the case of stations with a single island platform with departures either side, both platforms). The red button when pressed, gives the user two way communication with the closest control station.\n\nBusy stations are often provided with an electronic [[light-emitting diode|LED]] {{Tooltip|PID|Passenger Information Display}}s, which indicate the destination, time, stopping pattern summary, and minutes to departure for the next train on the platform.\n\nStations on the [[City Loop]], in addition to [[North Melbourne railway station|North Melbourne]], [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]], and [[Box Hill railway station, Melbourne|Box Hill]] stations, have [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen {{Tooltip|PID|Passenger Information Display}}s, although some of these have recently been replaced by [[widescreen]] [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens. These displays show in detail the destination, scheduled and actual departure time, and all stations the next train stops at. Also shown is the destination and time of the following train, and the system is capable of providing suggested connections and warn of service interruptions.\n\nOn Sunday, 26 September 2010, the PRIDE system was upgraded with new voice announcements. The voice is now female, and now advises to touch on and off when using Myki.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Trains go female|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgr0STnslIA|work=Video|accessdate=28 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs part of the Bayside Rail Upgrade, stations on the [[Frankston railway line|Frankston line]] will receive new \"network status boards\". These LCD screens provide travel information on all of Melbournes 16 railway lines as well as tram & bus services, including delays, replacement services or planned disruptions.<ref>[http://ptv.vic.gov.au/projects/rail-projects/bayside-rail-project/network-status-boards/ Network Status Boards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915072650/http://ptv.vic.gov.au/projects/rail-projects/bayside-rail-project/network-status-boards/ |date=15 September 2014 }} Public Transport Victoria</ref>\n\n=== Safeworking ===\n[[File:Signal-and-train-stop-melbourne.jpg|thumb|A signal with associated train stop in the raised position to the right]]\n\nMost lines in Melbourne operate under an automatic block system of safeworking with three-position power signalling. This permits [[Railway signal|signals]] to operate automatically with the passage of trains, enforcing the distance between them. At junctions signals are manually controlled from [[signal box]]es, with [[interlocking]]s used to ensure conflicting paths are not set. The [[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse line]] has two-position automatic signalling, a variant of the three-position system.\n\nThe outer end of the [[Hurstbridge railway line|Hurstbridge line]] used to be operated with [[Token (railway signalling)|token based systems]] and two-position manual signalling, where access to the line is based upon possession of a token. It was dismantled in 2013.\n\n[[Train stop]]s are used to enforce stop indications on signals\u2014should a train pass a signal, the train's brakes will automatically be applied. Trains are also fitted with [[pilot valve]]s, a form of [[dead man's switch]] that applies the brakes should the driver fail to maintain a foot or hand pilot valve in a set position.<ref name=\"safe\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/Doi/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/0C6245228F9F50A3CA2570AE0012723F?OpenDocument\n |title       = Rail system safety\n |work        = Department of Infrastructure website\n |accessdate  = 22 December 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090520043834/http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/0C6245228F9F50A3CA2570AE0012723F?OpenDocument\n |archivedate = 20 May 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The \"VICERS\" [[Dead-man's vigilance device|vigilance control]] and [[event recorder]] system is also being currently fitted to suburban trains to provide an additional level of safety.<ref name=\"safe\" />\n\n=== Train control ===\nThe main control room for the rail network is [[Metrol, Melbourne rail network|Metrol]].

All fleet types have used these classifications, with different fleet types using different number ranges for the carriages.\n\n*'''M''' indicates a motorised carriage, with a driving compartment.\n*'''T''' indicates a trailer carriage.\n*'''D''' indicated a trailer carriage with a driving compartment. Only Swing-door, Tait, and Hitachi trains had these.\n*'''G''' indicated a trailer carriage fitted with both gas and electric lighting, for use on country services. Only Tait trains had these.\n*'''BT''' indicated a second class trailer carriage. Prior to the abolition of first class suburban travel in 1958, motorised carriage were generally second class and trailer carriages were generally first class.\n\nAn exception to the above classifications was the [[4D (train)|trial double-deck]] train, which used '''T''' to indicate a trailer carriage with a driving compartment, and '''M''' to indicate a motorised carriage without a driving compartment.\n\nCurrently, all trains are assembled into a symmetrical '''M-T-M''' arrangement. Trains comprise either one or two such units. All peak period services and some off-peak services comprise two units. The now retired [[Hitachi (Australian train)|Hitachi]] trains operated in fixed two-unit sets.\n\n=== Lines ===\nMelbourne's suburban network includes 16 electrified lines and 1 non-electrified line.<ref name=\":0\" /> Many lines have been lengthened over time, most notably the [[Mernda railway line|Mernda line]] from [[Epping railway station, Melbourne|Epping]] to [[South Morang railway station|South Morang]] in 2012 and again to [[Mernda railway station|Mernda]] in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://levelcrossings.vic.gov.au/projects/mernda-rail-extension-project|title=Mernda rail extension project {{!}} Level Crossing Removal Authority|website=levelcrossings.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Lines have also changed terminus or layout, including the forthcoming changes to the Cranbourne, Pakenham and Sunbury lines as part of the [[Melbourne Metro Rail Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/projects/rail-projects/Works-to-transform-the-Cranbourne-Pakenham-corridor/|title=Works to transform the Cranbourne Pakenham corridor|website=www.ptv.vic.gov.au|language=English|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Numerous [[Proposed Melbourne rail extensions|proposals for new lines or extensions]] not yet constructed have been made, including the long-outstanding [[Doncaster railway line]] and [[Melbourne Airport rail link]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/12/turnbull-puts-up-5bn-for-melbourne-airport-rail-link|title=Turnbull puts up $5bn for Melbourne airport rail link|last=Davey|first=Melissa|date=2018-04-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==== Electrified lines ====\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Alamein railway line]]\n*[[Belgrave railway line]]\n*[[Craigieburn railway line]]\n*[[Cranbourne railway line]]\n*[[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse/Showgrounds railway line]]\n*[[Frankston railway line]]\n*[[Glen Waverley railway line]]\n*[[Hurstbridge railway line]]\n*[[Lilydale railway line]]\n*[[Mernda railway line]]\n*[[Pakenham railway line]]\n*[[Sandringham railway line]]\n*[[Sunbury railway line]]\n*[[Upfield railway line]]\n*[[Werribee railway line]]\n*[[Williamstown railway line]]\n*[[City Loop]] (incorporated into several other lines)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==== Non-electrified lines ====\n*[[Deer Park\u2013West Werribee railway line]] (non-electrified train service operated by V/Line)\n*[[Melton railway line]] (non-electrified train service operated by V/Line)\n*[[Stony Point railway line]] (non-electrified train service beyond Frankston)\n\n===== Stony Point line and metropolitan V/Line services =====\n[[Stony Point railway line|Stony Point]] line services operate as shuttles from [[Frankston railway station|Frankston]] station with passengers to and from [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street]] required to change trains. It is the only non-electrified line operated by Metro Trains, with services being operated using [[V/Line Sprinter|Sprinter]] diesel multiple units leased from [[V/Line]].\n\n[[Melton railway line|Melton (Ballarat line)]] and [[Deer Park\u2013West Werribee railway line|Wyndham Vale (Geelong line)]] services are operated by [[V/Line]] and depart from [[Southern Cross railway station|Southern Cross]], but are within the metropolitan ticketing zone. Bacchus Marsh/Melton/Ballarat trains stop at Rockbank, Caroline Springs, Deer Park and Ardeer. Wyndham Vale/Geelong trains also stop at Ardeer and Deer Park, along with Tarneit. Only Wyndham Vale and Ballarat trains stop at Ardeer, not Geelong trains.\n\n5 morning peak and 3 afternoon peak trains operate to and from Wyndham Vale. One weekday morning service and numerous football services operate to Wyndham Vale.\n\nFrequent peak hour trains operate to and from Bacchus Marsh and Melton. Since 2015, weekday hourly trains have also operated to Bacchus Marsh. On top of Ballarat trains stopping here, Bacchus Marsh residents have half hourly services to the city.\n\nOn weekdays, Geelong and Ballarat trains run express after Tarneit and Melton respectively, with Wyndham Vale, Bacchus Marsh and Melton trains stopping between Rockbank and Sunshine. On weekends, these stations are serviced by Ballarat trains.\n\nSunbury services used to also be operated by V/Line until 2012 when the electrical network was extended to Sunbury and these trains also stopped at Diggers Rest; Sunbury passengers can still catch V/Line trains to or from Bendigo. The redundant carriages were moved onto Bacchus Marsh services instead. V/Line trains used to also operate to Donnybrook, stopping at Craigieburn but since the electrical network was extended to Craigieburn in 2007, trains have stopped terminating at Donnybrook.\n\n=== Service patterns ===\n{{main|Metro Trains Melbourne#Service patterns}}\nSuburban services are operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]]. Railway lines and service patterns are often classified into groups, which are:\n*Burnley group\n**[[Lilydale railway line|Lilydale]], [[Belgrave railway line|Belgrave]], [[Alamein railway line|Alamein]] and [[Glen Waverley railway line|Glen Waverley]] line (blue)\n*Caulfield group\n**[[Pakenham railway line|Pakenham]] and [[Cranbourne railway line|Cranbourne]] line (light blue)\n**[[Sandringham railway line|Sandringham]] line (pink)\n*Clifton Hill group\n**[[Mernda railway line|Mernda]] and [[Hurstbridge railway line|Hurstbridge]] line (red)\n*Northern group\n**[[Sunbury railway line|Sunbury]], [[Craigieburn railway line|Craigieburn]] and [[Upfield railway line|Upfield]] line (yellow)\n*Cross-City group\n**[[Frankston railway line|Frankston]], [[Werribee railway line|Werribee]] and [[Williamstown railway line|Williamstown]] line (green)\n**[[Stony Point railway line|Stony Point]] line (non-electrified train service beyond Frankston)\n*Special event services\n**[[Flemington Racecourse railway line|Flemington Racecourse/Showgrounds]]\n\nMost of the above lines travel along the [[City Loop]], and as some trains change to service other lines at their terminus, others may run through the City Loop incidentally. The Frankston line does not travel along the City Loop on off-peak weekdays, but does so during the peak and weekends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/getting-around/maps/metropolitan-trains/view/6/|title=Metropolitan trains|website=www.ptv.vic.gov.au|language=English|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\nMelbourne uses [[clock-face scheduling]] in off-peak periods, but generally not in [[rush hour]], due to the network operating near to infrastructure capacity and having to accommodate single-line sections, flat junctions, and regional diesel-hauled trains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/metro-warns-of-capacity-crunch-within-two-years-on-some-train-lines-20170704-gx4giy.html|title=Metro warns of capacity crunch within two years on some train lines|last=Carey|first=Adam|date=2017-07-04|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Frequencies vary according to time of day, day of week and by line.

All services become 24-hour from Friday morning to Sunday evening, with at least one departure every hour after 12am.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAlong with other Australian railways, Melbourne uses the British terminology of \"[[rail terminology#U|up]]\" and \"[[rail terminology#D|down]]\", with \"up\" being defined as toward Flinders Street station in the CBD.\n\n=== Fares and tickets ===\n{{main|myki}}\n\nThe [[myki]] [[smart card|smart-card]] ticketing system is the main ticketing system currently in use across Melbourne, introduced in 2010. Prior to December 2012 Melbourne also used a magnetic strip [[paper ticket]] system known as the [[Metcard]], first introduced to the railway network in 1996. On 29 December 2012 Metcard was no longer available for use on Melbourne's public transport and completely replaced by myki. Multi-modal tickets were first introduced in Melbourne in 1969 and prior to this train, tram and bus services all had separated ticketing systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robx1.net/victkt/intro.htm|title=Melbourne's Multi-Modal Based Ticketing Systems 1969 to present|website=www.robx1.net|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Host stations and premium stations ===\nHost stations and premium stations are categories of railway stations on the suburban rail network.

The lines are of two gauges\u2014{{RailGauge|5ft3in}} [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]] and {{RailGauge|ussg}} [[standard gauge]], and are not electrified. In the inner western suburbs of the city, freight trains operate on dedicated lines, but in other areas freight trains share tracks with the suburban [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] and regional [[V/Line]] passenger services. The majority of freight terminals are located in the inner suburbs around [[Port of Melbourne]], others are located between the Melbourne CBD and Footscray.\n\nUntil the 1980s a number of suburban stations had their own [[rail yard|goods yards]], with freight trains running over the suburban network, often with the [[Victorian Railways E class (electric)|E]] or [[Victorian Railways L class (electric)|L class]] [[electric locomotive]]s.\n\n== Legislation, governance and access ==\n\n=== Key statutes ===\n{{Main|Transport Integration Act}}\n{{See also|Director of Public Transport|V/Line|VicTrack|Transport Act 1983|Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983}}\nThe prime rail statute in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is the [[Transport Integration Act]].
