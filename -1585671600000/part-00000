Fethard's founding charter gave it the status of a '[[borough]]' and provided it with a constitution. Under this constitution, the town's people ([[burgess (title)|burgesses]]) had fixed annual rents, access to a court, and defined fines for certain offences.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\n[[File:North Gate, Fethard , Co.

The first reference to the walling of Fethard dates to 1292 when the king allowed levies to be applied (over seven years) on items sold in the town, with the collected funds allocated to \"the inclosing of their vill and the greater security of Ireland\".<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> Records of money still being collected (to fund wall building) date to the 14th century,<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> with another grant issued for Fethard in 1375. This grant specified that stone walls were to be built, suggesting that the earlier town walls were made of earth and timber.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\n[[File:FethardWalls3483c.jpg|thumb|Defensive wall along the northern bank of the Clashawley River]]\nThe town received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1552-3, allowing it a corporation in perpetuity, composed of one Sovereign, one Provost, Burgesses and inhabitants.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> The next royal charter was issued in 1608.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> A figure in the attainment of this second charter was Sir [[John Everard (MP)|John Everard]].<ref name=\"ball1926\">Ball, F.

His performances as a justice in the Earl's liberty of Tipperary saw him appointed by Elizabeth I as Second Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]] in 1602.<ref name=\"ball1926\"/> Although the Everards were Catholic, John Everard (by this time \"Sir\" John Everard) pledged allegiance to the Crown, and when he surrendered all his property to the Crown in 1607, it was immediately granted back to him.

Tipperary - geograph.org.uk - 207562.jpg|thumb|Fethard Town Hall, built as an almshouse c. 1600]]In the new charter, the town was described as \"a place of strength surrounded with a fair strong wall\", and under its terms the town's corporation was renewed and enlarged.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> The Fethard corporation was directed to build \"a [[Tholsel]] (common Hall) for assemblies\", the foundations of which now lie under the main street.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\nDuring the 17th century, the town was subject to two significant threats. The first was by the army of [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin]], and followed his [[Sack of Cashel|Sacking of Cashel]] in 1647. When news of the massacre at Cashel reached Fethard, its citizens submitted to Inchiquin. Three years later, in 1650, [[Oliver Cromwell]] marched on Fethard on his way to [[Siege of Kilkenny|besiege and take Kilkenny]]. In a letter, Cromwell described Fethard as \"having a very good wall with round and square bulwarks, after the old manner of fortification\". Referring to the nearby Augustinian Friary, he wrote that he had stationed troops \"in an old abbey in the suburbs\". As with Inchiquin, the citizens of Fethard also agreed terms of surrender with Cromwell.<ref name=\"ball1926\"/>\n\nBy the 18th century, some parts of the town were in a state of decay, with the corporation's books for 1718 noting that 56 people had houses with dangerous chimneys.<ref>Michael O'Donnell, ''Tipperary Historical Journal'' (1988), pp. 22-38.</ref> In the same period, the Everard family's involvement with Fethard came to an end when the last Baronet, Sir Redmond Everard, who lived in France, sold the his family's properties in Fethard in 1752.

Fethard's founding charter gave it the status of a '[[borough]]' and provided it with a constitution. Under this constitution, the town's people ([[burgess (title)|burgesses]]) had fixed annual rents, access to a court, and defined fines for certain offences.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\n[[File:North Gate, Fethard , Co. Tipperary - geograph.org.uk - 207572.jpg|thumb|North Gate]]\nThe town and lands of Fethard passed out of William de Braose's hands in 1208 following a dispute with King John.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> In 1215 Fethard was granted to the [[archbishop]]s of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], and it remained part of the archiepiscopal estates until the 16th century.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> At the start of the 14th century, an Augustinian Friary was established outside the town.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\nBecause of some lawlessness in the town's hinterland (marked, for example, when the nearby woods of Thomas de St Aubin were cleared because some travelling merchants had been robbed or killed), defensive walls were built around Fethard and other towns in the area. The first reference to the walling of Fethard dates to 1292 when the king allowed levies to be applied (over seven years) on items sold in the town, with the collected funds allocated to \"the inclosing of their vill and the greater security of Ireland\".<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> Records of money still being collected (to fund wall building) date to the 14th century,<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> with another grant issued for Fethard in 1375. This grant specified that stone walls were to be built, suggesting that the earlier town walls were made of earth and timber.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\n[[File:FethardWalls3483c.jpg|thumb|Defensive wall along the northern bank of the Clashawley River]]\nThe town received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1552-3, allowing it a corporation in perpetuity, composed of one Sovereign, one Provost, Burgesses and inhabitants.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> The next royal charter was issued in 1608.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> A figure in the attainment of this second charter was Sir [[John Everard (MP)|John Everard]].<ref name=\"ball1926\">Ball, F.

His performances as a justice in the Earl's liberty of Tipperary saw him appointed by Elizabeth I as Second Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]] in 1602.<ref name=\"ball1926\"/> Although the Everards were Catholic, John Everard (by this time \"Sir\" John Everard) pledged allegiance to the Crown, and when he surrendered all his property to the Crown in 1607, it was immediately granted back to him. His good favour with the Crown was a factor in Fethard attaining a new charter in 1608.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\n[[File:Town Hall, Fethard, Co. Tipperary - geograph.org.uk - 207562.jpg|thumb|Fethard Town Hall, built as an almshouse c. 1600]]In the new charter, the town was described as \"a place of strength surrounded with a fair strong wall\", and under its terms the town's corporation was renewed and enlarged.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/> The Fethard corporation was directed to build \"a [[Tholsel]] (common Hall) for assemblies\", the foundations of which now lie under the main street.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\nDuring the 17th century, the town was subject to two significant threats. The first was by the army of [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin]], and followed his [[Sack of Cashel|Sacking of Cashel]] in 1647. When news of the massacre at Cashel reached Fethard, its citizens submitted to Inchiquin. Three years later, in 1650, [[Oliver Cromwell]] marched on Fethard on his way to [[Siege of Kilkenny|besiege and take Kilkenny]]. In a letter, Cromwell described Fethard as \"having a very good wall with round and square bulwarks, after the old manner of fortification\". Referring to the nearby Augustinian Friary, he wrote that he had stationed troops \"in an old abbey in the suburbs\". As with Inchiquin, the citizens of Fethard also agreed terms of surrender with Cromwell.<ref name=\"ball1926\"/>\n\nBy the 18th century, some parts of the town were in a state of decay, with the corporation's books for 1718 noting that 56 people had houses with dangerous chimneys.<ref>Michael O'Donnell, ''Tipperary Historical Journal'' (1988), pp. 22-38.</ref> In the same period, the Everard family's involvement with Fethard came to an end when the last Baronet, Sir Redmond Everard, who lived in France, sold the his family's properties in Fethard in 1752. The new landowner, Mr Barton (a wine merchant from Bordeaux), replaced the old Everard mansion with a new house, which in turn became a military barracks early in the 19th century.<ref name=\"okeefe\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century the remaining medieval fabric of the town was largely demolished, with all but one of the town's gates removed.

[[Dementia]] is a disorder that affects many parts of the brain and many parts of everyday life. Simple tasks such as walking or eating become difficult. Most commonly known is that dementia affects memory. Sensory or therapeutic gardens can be used to reduce the symptoms of dementia without the use of drugs though stimulation of the senses and the exercise of certain part of the brain. A part of the brain affected last is the amygdala which primarily handles emotions and feelings. Therefore things like sensory gardens can be very impactful on dementia patients because they elicits positive emotions.

[[Dementia]] is a disorder that affects many parts of the brain and many parts of everyday life. Simple tasks such as walking or eating become difficult. Most commonly known is that dementia affects memory. Sensory or therapeutic gardens can be used to reduce the symptoms of dementia without the use of drugs though stimulation of the senses and the exercise of certain part of the brain. A part of the brain affected last is the amygdala which primarily handles emotions and feelings. Therefore things like sensory gardens can be very impactful on dementia patients because they elicits positive emotions. Features could include: water features that produces soothing sounds, pick-and-sniff herb and flower beds, and benches with different types of sand or pebbles to sink their feet into.

The quietist school advocates for societal reform through religious education and proselytizing rather than political activism. The activist school, to the contrary, encourages political participation within the constitutional and political framework. The jihadist school is inspired by the ideology of [[Sayyid Qutb]] ([[Qutbism]], see below), and rejects the legitimacy of secular institutions and promotes the revolution in order to pave the way for the establishment of a new [[Caliphate]].<ref name=\"Mo\">Mohie-Eldin, Fatima.

The defeat along with economic stagnation in the defeated countries, was blamed on the secular [[Arab nationalism]] of the ruling regimes. A steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist and nationalist politics ensued.

In a major shock to the rest of the world, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] led the Iranian Revolution of 1979 in order to overthrow the oil-rich, well-armed, Westernized and pro-American secular monarchy ruled by Shah [[Muhammad Reza Pahlavi]].\n\nThe views of [[Ali Shariati]], the ideologue of the [[Iranian Revolution]], resembled those of [[Mohammad Iqbal]], the ideological father of the [[State of Pakistan]], but Khomeini's beliefs are perceived to be placed somewhere between the beliefs of Shia Islam and the beliefs of Sunni Islamic thinkers like Mawdudi and Qutb. He believed that complete imitation of the [[Prophet Mohammad]] and his successors such as [[Ali]] for the restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam, that many secular, Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West and therefore serving Western interests, and that acts such as the \"plundering\" of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by Western governments.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Khomeini (1981), p. 54</ref>\n\nHis views differed from those of Sunni scholars in:\n* As a [[Shia]],  Khomeini looked to [[Ali]] ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] Imam, but not Caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar|Omar]] or [[Uthman]].\n* Khomeini talked not about restoring the [[Caliphate]] or [[Sunni]] [[Islamic democracy]], but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or  the dictatorial political system was performed by Shia jurists (''[[ulama]]'') as the successors of [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|Shia Imams]] until the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]] returns from [[occultation]]. His concept of ''[[velayat-e-faqih]]'' (\"guardianship of the [Islamic] jurist\"), held that the leading Shia Muslim cleric in society\u2014which Khomeini's mass of followers believed and chose to be himself\u2014should serve as the supervisor of the state in order to protect or \"guard\" Islam and ''Sharia'' law from \"innovation\" and \"anti-Islamic laws\" passed by dictators or democratic parliaments.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nThe revolution was influenced by [[Marxism]] through Islamist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter Marxism ([[Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr]]'s work) or to integrate socialism and Islamism  ([[Ali Shariati]]'s work).

Crackdowns followed on everything from shopkeepers who did not close for prayer and newspapers that published pictures of women, to the selling of dolls, teddy bears (images of animate objects are considered [[haraam]]), and dog food (dogs are considered unclean).<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam,'' p. 155</ref>\n\nIn other Muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundamentalists, but against Islamic fundamentalism's foremost geopolitical enemy\u2014the United States. Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] sparked attacks on American embassies when he announced:\n<blockquote>It is not beyond guessing that this is the work of criminal [[American imperialism]] and international Zionism</blockquote> despite the fact that the object of the fundamentalists' revolt was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, America's major ally in the region. Anti-American demonstrations followed in the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], the [[UAE]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Kuwait]].

The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims ([[mujahideen]]) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith.

Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid. But when Saddam, secularist and [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] dictator of neighboring [[Iraq]], attacked Kuwait (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy. Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.\n\nThese attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam's defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced.<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] pp. 205\u201317</ref>  One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Egypt]], a bloody civil war in [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|Algeria]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]'s terror attacks climaxing in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attack]].<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] p. 207</ref>\n\n===Rise of Islamism by country===\n====Afghanistan (Taliban)====\n[[File:Flag of Taliban.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Taliban]]]]\n{{main|Taliban}}\n[[File:Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan (2015\u2013present).svg|thumb|Military situation, as of 2017\n{{legend|#ffffff|Under control of the Taliban, [[Al-Qaeda]], and [[Islamic Jihad Union|Allies]]}}]]\nIn Afghanistan, the mujahideen's victory against the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity, due to a vicious and destructive [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] between political and tribal warlords, making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth. In 1992, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] ruled by communist forces collapsed, and [[Islamic democracy|democratic Islamist]] elements of mujahdeen founded the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]]. In 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the [[Taliban]] rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban were spawned by the thousands of [[madrasah]]s the [[Deobandi]] movement established for impoverished [[Afghan refugees]] and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan.<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp. 26, 32</ref> The Taliban differed from other Islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] or neofundamentalist, interested in spreading \"an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs\" under the label of Sharia to an entire country.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/447 Is Islamism a Threat?

Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by [[Abbassi Madani]], and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, [[Ali Belhadj]]. Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men. The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nAs Islamists took up arms to overthrow the government, the FIS's leaders were arrested and it became overshadowed by Islamist guerrilla groups, particularly the [[Islamic Salvation Army]], MIA and [[Armed Islamic Group]] (or GIA). A bloody and devastating [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] ensued in which between 150,000 and 200,000 people were killed over the next decade.\n\nThe civil war was not a victory for Islamists. By 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or had surrendered. The popularity of Islamist parties has declined to the point that \"the Islamist candidate, Abdallah Jaballah, came a distant third with 5% of the vote\" in the 2004 presidential election.<ref>\"International: Freer and more peaceful; An election in Algeria,\" ''The Economist'', April 17, 2004.

Fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s (particularly the manifesto ''Milestones'', a.k.a. ''[[Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq]]'') did, however, develop and they pursued a more radical direction.<ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p. 332</ref> By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals.\n\nThe path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization responsible for the assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981. Unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] group directed its attacks against what it believed were \"apostate\" leaders of Muslim states, leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies. Its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag, in which he states:\n<blockquote>...there is no doubt that the first battlefield for jihad is the extermination of these infidel leaders and to replace them by a complete Islamic Order...</blockquote>\n\nAnother of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was  [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] (Islamic Group). Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a parliamentary speaker ([[Rifaat al-Mahgoub]]), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/timeline_egypt.html |title=Timeline of modern Egypt |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref>  Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]), renounced violence in 2003.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2006/04/200841010710321761.html |title=Egypt frees 900 Islamist militants |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, [[Salvation from Hell]] and [[Takfir wal-Hijra]], and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.<ref>Mazih Ayubi, ''Political Islam'', 1991, p. 73</ref>\n\n==== France ====\nThe Democratic Union of Muslims, a party founded in 2012, planned to take part in 2019 municipal elections.

HT is unique from most other Islamist movements in that the party focuses not on implementation of Sharia on local level or on providing social services, but on unifying the Muslim world under its vision of a new Islamic [[caliphate]] spanning from North Africa and the Middle East to much of central and South Asia.\n\nTo this end it has drawn up and published a 186-article constitution for its proposed caliphate-state specifying specific policies such as sharia law, a \"unitary ruling system\" headed by a caliph elected by Muslims, an economy based on the [[gold standard]], public ownership of utilities, public transport, and energy resources, death for [[murtadd|apostates]] and Arabic as the \"sole language of the State.\"<ref name = \"The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State1\">{{cite book |author=Hizb ut-Tahrir |title=The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State|url=http://www.hizb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Draft-Constitution.pdf |publisher=Khilafah|date=February 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"The Draft Constitution of the Khilafah State2\">{{cite web|title=Draft Constitution by Hizb ut-Tahrir|url=http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm|publisher=Media Office of Hizb ut-Tahrir|accessdate=29 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200116/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.info/english/constitution.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn its focus on the Caliphate, the party takes a different view of Muslim history than some other Islamists such as [[Muhammad Qutb]]. HT sees Islam's pivotal turning point as occurring not with the death of [[Ali]], or one of the other four [[Rashidun|rightly guided Caliphs]] in the 7th century, but with the [[Caliph#Abolition of the institution|abolition]] of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]] in 1924.

Primarily by the Egyptian military and courts following the forcible removal of [[2013 Egyptian coup d'\u00e9tat|Morsi from office in 2013]]; but also by Saudi Arabia and a number of Gulf countries (not Qatar).<ref name=Mecham>{{cite news|last1=Mecham|first1=Quinn|title=The evolution of Islamism since the Arab uprisings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/24/the-evolution-of-islamism-since-the-arab-uprisings/|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Washington Post|date=October 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name=brookings>{{cite web|title=Rethinking Political Islam|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports2/2015/08/rethinking-political-islam|website=brookings.edu|publisher=Brookings|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>\n* Rise of Islamist \"[[state-building]]\" where \"state failure\" has taken place\u2014most prominently in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen.  Islamists have found it easier than competing non-Islamists trying to fill the void of state failure, by securing external funding, weaponry and fighters\u2014\"many of which have come from abroad and have rallied around a pan-Islamic identity\". The norms of governance in these Islamist areas are militia-based, and the population submit to their authority out of fear, loyalty, other reasons, or some combination.<ref name=Mecham/> The \"most expansive\" of these new \"models\" is the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].<ref name=Mecham/>\n* Increasing sectarianism at least in part from [[Proxy War]]s. Fighters are proxies primarily for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states and for Iran. Islamists are fighting Islamists across sectarian lines in Lebanon (Sunni militants targeting [[Hezbollah]] positions), Yemen (between mainstream Sunni Islamists of [[Islah]] and the Shiite [[Zaydi]] [[Houthi]] movement), in Iraq (Islamic State and Iraqi Shiite militias)<ref name=Mecham/>\n* Increased caution and political learning in countries such as Algeria and Jordan where Islamist have chosen not to lead a major challenge against their governments. In Yemen Islah \"has sought to frame its ideology in a way that will avoid charges of militancy\".<ref name=Mecham/>\nAnother observer (Tarek Osman) notes with concern that\n* the failure to take power during the Arab Spring has led not to \"soul-searching\" in major Islamist groups about what went wrong, but instead to \"antagonism and fiery anger\" and a thirst for revenge. Partisans of political Islam (although this does not include some prominent leaders such as [[Rached Ghannouchi]] but is particularly true in Egypt) see themselves as victims of an injustice whose perpetrators are not just \"individual conspirators but entire social groups\".<ref name=\"osman-2016-244\">{{cite book|last1=Osman|first1=Tarek|title=Islamism: What It Means for the Middle East and

The quietist school advocates for societal reform through religious education and proselytizing rather than political activism. The activist school, to the contrary, encourages political participation within the constitutional and political framework. The jihadist school is inspired by the ideology of [[Sayyid Qutb]] ([[Qutbism]], see below), and rejects the legitimacy of secular institutions and promotes the revolution in order to pave the way for the establishment of a new [[Caliphate]].<ref name=\"Mo\">Mohie-Eldin, Fatima.

In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Syria]], he promoted ideas of [[Pan-Islamism|greater Islamic political co-operation and unity]], calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.

He believed that complete imitation of the [[Prophet Mohammad]] and his successors such as [[Ali]] for the restoration of Sharia law was essential to Islam, that many secular, Westernizing Muslims were actually agents of the West and therefore serving Western interests, and that acts such as the \"plundering\" of Muslim lands was part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam by Western governments.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Khomeini (1981), p. 54</ref>\n\nHis views differed from those of Sunni scholars in:\n* As a [[Shia]],  Khomeini looked to [[Ali]] ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib and [[Husayn ibn Ali]] Imam, but not Caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar|Omar]] or [[Uthman]].\n* Khomeini talked not about restoring the [[Caliphate]] or [[Sunni]] [[Islamic democracy]], but about establishing a state where the guardianship of the democratic or  the dictatorial political system was performed by Shia jurists (''[[ulama]]'') as the successors of [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|Shia Imams]] until the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]] returns from [[occultation]]. His concept of ''[[velayat-e-faqih]]'' (\"guardianship of the [Islamic] jurist\"), held that the leading Shia Muslim cleric in society\u2014which Khomeini's mass of followers believed and chose to be himself\u2014should serve as the supervisor of the state in order to protect or \"guard\" Islam and ''Sharia'' law from \"innovation\" and \"anti-Islamic laws\" passed by dictators or democratic parliaments.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nThe revolution was influenced by [[Marxism]] through Islamist thought and also by writings that sought either to counter Marxism ([[Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr]]'s work) or to integrate socialism and Islamism  ([[Ali Shariati]]'s work).

Anti-American demonstrations followed in the [[Philippines]], [[Turkey]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], the [[UAE]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Kuwait]]. The US Embassy in [[Libya]] was burned by protesters chanting pro-Khomeini slogans and the embassy in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan was burned to the ground.<ref>Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage: The Wrath of Militant Islam'', p. 149</ref>\n\n====Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979\u20131989)====\nIn 1979, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan]], attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]]. The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims ([[mujahideen]]) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith.

Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid. But when Saddam, secularist and [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist]] dictator of neighboring [[Iraq]], attacked Kuwait (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy. Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.\n\nThese attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam's defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced.<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] pp. 205\u201317</ref>  One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Egypt]], a bloody civil war in [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|Algeria]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]'s terror attacks climaxing in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11 attack]].<ref>''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' [[Gilles Kepel]] p. 207</ref>\n\n===Rise of Islamism by country===\n====Afghanistan (Taliban)====\n[[File:Flag of Taliban.svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Taliban]]]]\n{{main|Taliban}}\n[[File:Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan (2015\u2013present).svg|thumb|Military situation, as of 2017\n{{legend|#ffffff|Under control of the Taliban, [[Al-Qaeda]], and [[Islamic Jihad Union|Allies]]}}]]\nIn Afghanistan, the mujahideen's victory against the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s did not lead to justice and prosperity, due to a vicious and destructive [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|civil war]] between political and tribal warlords, making Afghanistan one of the poorest countries on earth. In 1992, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] ruled by communist forces collapsed, and [[Islamic democracy|democratic Islamist]] elements of mujahdeen founded the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]]. In 1996, a more conservative and anti-democratic Islamist movement known as the [[Taliban]] rose to power, defeated most of the warlords and took over roughly 80% of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Taliban were spawned by the thousands of [[madrasah]]s the [[Deobandi]] movement established for impoverished [[Afghan refugees]] and supported by governmental and religious groups in neighboring Pakistan.<ref>Rashid, ''Taliban'' (2000), pp. 26, 32</ref> The Taliban differed from other Islamist movements to the point where they might be more properly described as [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] or neofundamentalist, interested in spreading \"an idealized and systematized version of conservative tribal village customs\" under the label of Sharia to an entire country.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/447 Is Islamism a Threat?

Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by [[Abbassi Madani]], and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, [[Ali Belhadj]]. Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men. The FIS won sweeping victories in local elections and it was going to win national elections in 1991 when voting was canceled by a military coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nAs Islamists took up arms to overthrow the government, the FIS's leaders were arrested and it became overshadowed by Islamist guerrilla groups, particularly the [[Islamic Salvation Army]], MIA and [[Armed Islamic Group]] (or GIA). A bloody and devastating [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] ensued in which between 150,000 and 200,000 people were killed over the next decade.\n\nThe civil war was not a victory for Islamists. By 2002 the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or had surrendered. The popularity of Islamist parties has declined to the point that \"the Islamist candidate, Abdallah Jaballah, came a distant third with 5% of the vote\" in the 2004 presidential election.<ref>\"International: Freer and more peaceful; An election in Algeria,\" ''The Economist'', April 17, 2004.

Fringe or splinter movements inspired by the final writings of Qutb in the mid-1960s (particularly the manifesto ''Milestones'', a.k.a. ''[[Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq]]'') did, however, develop and they pursued a more radical direction.<ref>Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p. 332</ref> By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals.\n\nThe path of violence and military struggle was then taken up by the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization responsible for the assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981. Unlike earlier anti-colonial movements the [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] group directed its attacks against what it believed were \"apostate\" leaders of Muslim states, leaders who held secular leanings or who had introduced or promoted Western/foreign ideas and practices into Islamic societies. Its views were outlined in a pamphlet written by Muhammad Abd al-Salaam Farag, in which he states:\n<blockquote>...there is no doubt that the first battlefield for jihad is the extermination of these infidel leaders and to replace them by a complete Islamic Order...</blockquote>\n\nAnother of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was  [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] (Islamic Group). Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a parliamentary speaker ([[Rifaat al-Mahgoub]]), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/timeline_egypt.html |title=Timeline of modern Egypt |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref>  Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]), renounced violence in 2003.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2006/04/200841010710321761.html |title=Egypt frees 900 Islamist militants |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, [[Salvation from Hell]] and [[Takfir wal-Hijra]], and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.<ref>Mazih Ayubi, ''Political Islam'', 1991, p. 73</ref>\n\n==== France ====\nThe Democratic Union of Muslims, a party founded in 2012, planned to take part in 2019 municipal elections.

Partisans of political Islam (although this does not include some prominent leaders such as [[Rached Ghannouchi]] but is particularly true in Egypt) see themselves as victims of an injustice whose

The ''Regina'' Division was a regular division of the Italian Army. It was formed on 1 March 1939 in the [[Italian Islands of the Aegean]] and formally dissolved in the same place 11 September 1943, although some sub-units continued to fight until 16 November 1943.\n\n==Actions==\nThe division was originally deployed on the islands of [[Rhodes]], [[Leros]], [[Kos]], [[Karpathos]], [[Kasos]], [[Kalymnos]], [[Kastelorizo]], [[Stampalia]], [[Patmos]], with small detachments on other islands.<ref>http://www.regioesercito.it/reparti/fanteria/rediv50.htm</ref> In 1940 ''Regina'' was reinforced by 201st [[CCNN]] legion and 312nd tank battalion. On 20 November 1940, two companies from 1st battalion, 10th infantry regiment expelled Greek sailors who had captured [[Agathonisi]] island the previous day. In response to the British [[Operation Abstention]], 4th battalion, 10th infantry regiment recaptured the island of [[Kastelorizo]] on 28 February 1941. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Greece]] in early May 1941, the 10th regiment of ''Regina'' division, stationed on [[Kos]], proceeded to capture the Greek islands of [[Amorgos]], [[Anafi]], [[Ios (island)|Ios]], [[Naxos]], [[Paros]], [[Andros]], [[Tinos]], [[Kythnos]], [[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Serifos]], [[Skyros]], [[Mykonos]], [[Samos]], [[Ikaria]].
