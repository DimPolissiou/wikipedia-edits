Single-parent households tend to find difficulty with the lack of help they receive. More often than not a single parent finds it difficult to find help because there is a lack of support, whether it be a second parent or other family members. This tends to put a strain on not only the parent but also the relationship between the parent and their child.  Furthermore, dependency is a hardship that many parents find difficult to overcome.  As the single parent becomes closer to their child, the child grows more and more dependent upon that parent.  This dependency, while common, may reach far past childhood, damaging the child due to their lack of independence from their parent. \"Social isolation of single parents might be a stress factor that they transmit to children. Another explanation may be that the parents do not have the time needed to support and supervise their children. This can have a negative impact on the child.\"<ref name=\"Children in Single Parent Homes and Emotional Problems\">{{cite news |title = Children in Single Parent Homes and Emotional Problems |first = Erica |last = Williams |date = February 6, 2003 |newspaper = The Hilltop |url = http://www.thehilltoponline.com/2.4839/children-in-single-parent-homes-and-emotional-problems-1.472758 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090403002923/http://www.thehilltoponline.com/2.4839/children-in-single-parent-homes-and-emotional-problems-1.472758 |url-status = dead |archive-date = April 3, 2009 |publisher = Howard University |accessdate = 14 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nJust as above, it has been found that little 'specific' research to the positives of the father as a single parent has been done; however, there are various proven pros that accompany single parenting.  One proven statistic about single fathers states that a single father tends to use more positive parenting techniques than a married father.  As far as non-specific pros, a strong bond tends to be formed between parent and child in single-parenting situations, allowing for an increase in maturity and closeness in the household.  Gender roles are also less likely to be enforced in a single parent home because the work and chores are more likely to be shared among all individuals rather than specifically a male or female.<ref name=\"Single Parenting\">{{cite web|title=Better Health Channel|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/single_parenting?open|work=Online Article|publisher=State Government of Victoria|accessdate=2 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020121402/http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Single_parenting?open|archivedate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Living arrangements for single parents ====\nThe newest census  that the majority of America\u2019s 73.7 million children under age 18 live in families with two parents (69 percent), according to new statistics released from the U.S. Census Bureau.

Because of this dual role, in the United States, 80% of single mothers are employed, of which 50% are full-time workers and 30% are part-time. Many employed single mothers rely on childcare facilities to care for their children while they are away at work. Linked to the rising prevalence of single parenting is the increasing quality of health care, and there have been findings of positive developmental effects with modern childcare.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} It is not uncommon that the mother will become actively involved with the childcare program as to compensate for leaving her children under the care of others. Working single mothers may also rely on the help from [[fictive kinship|fictive kin]], who provide for the children while the mother is at her job. All of these factors contribute to a well-documented heightened likelihood for single-parent, female-headed households to experience poverty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pander|first=Shanta|last2=Zhan|first2=Min|year=2007|title=Postsecondary Education, Marital Status, and Economic Well Being of Women with Children|url=|journal=Social Development Issues|volume=29 |issue=1|pages=1\u201326|via=}}</ref>\n\nSingle mothers are one of the poorest populations, many of them vulnerable to homelessness. In the United States, nearly half (45%) of single mothers and their children live below the poverty line, also referred to as the [[poverty threshold]].<ref name=\":3\" /> They lack the financial resources to support their children when the birth father is unresponsive. Many seek assistance through living with another adult, perhaps a relative, [[fictive kinship|fictive kin]], or [[significant other]], and divorced mothers who remarry have fewer financial struggles than unmarried single mothers, who cannot work for longer periods of time without shirking their child-caring responsibilities.

Single-parent households tend to find difficulty with the lack of help they receive. More often than not a single parent finds it difficult to find help because there is a lack of support, whether it be a second parent or other family members. This tends to put a strain on not only the parent but also the relationship between the parent and their child.  Furthermore, dependency is a hardship that many parents find difficult to overcome.  As the single parent becomes closer to their child, the child grows more and more dependent upon that parent.  This dependency, while common, may reach far past childhood, damaging the child due to their lack of independence from their parent. \"Social isolation of single parents might be a stress factor that they transmit to children. Another explanation may be that the parents do not have the time needed to support and supervise their children. This can have a negative impact on the child.\"<ref name=\"Children in Single Parent Homes and Emotional Problems\">{{cite news |title = Children in Single Parent Homes and Emotional Problems |first = Erica |last = Williams |date = February 6, 2003 |newspaper = The Hilltop |url = http://www.thehilltoponline.com/2.4839/children-in-single-parent-homes-and-emotional-problems-1.472758 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090403002923/http://www.thehilltoponline.com/2.4839/children-in-single-parent-homes-and-emotional-problems-1.472758 |url-status = dead |archive-date = April 3, 2009 |publisher = Howard University |accessdate = 14 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nJust as above, it has been found that little 'specific' research to the positives of the father as a single parent has been done; however, there are various proven pros that accompany single parenting.  One proven statistic about single fathers states that a single father tends to use more positive parenting techniques than a married father.  As far as non-specific pros, a strong bond tends to be formed between parent and child in single-parenting situations, allowing for an increase in maturity and closeness in the household.  Gender roles are also less likely to be enforced in a single parent home because the work and chores are more likely to be shared among all individuals rather than specifically a male or female.<ref name=\"Single Parenting\">{{cite web|title=Better Health Channel|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/single_parenting?open|work=Online Article|publisher=State Government of Victoria|accessdate=2 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020121402/http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Single_parenting?open|archivedate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Living arrangements for single parents ====\nThe newest census  that the majority of America\u2019s 73.7 million children under age 18 live in families with two parents (69 percent), according to new statistics released from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is compared to other types of living arrangements, such as living with grandparents or having a single parent.
