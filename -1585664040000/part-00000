The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] in 1774, and of [[James Cook]] in 1778. Although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not explored until 1790, Spanish sailors visited [[Esquimalt Harbour]] (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.\n\nIn 1841 [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] a new more northerly post be built in case [[Fort Vancouver]] fell into American hands (see [[Oregon boundary dispute]]). Douglas founded [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] on the site of present-day Victoria in anticipation of the outcome of the [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846, extending the [[British North America]]/United States border along the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:(1862) VICTORIA FROM JAMES' BAY LOOKING UP GOVERNMENT STREET.jpg|thumb|left|View of Victoria from [[James Bay, Greater Victoria|James Bay]] in 1862.

[[Robert Dunsmuir]], a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed [[Craigdarroch Castle]] in the [[Rockland, Greater Victoria|Rockland]] area, near the [[Government House (British Columbia)|official residence]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|province's Lieutenant Governor]]. His son [[James Dunsmuir]] became [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] and subsequently Lieutenant Governor of the province and built his own grand residence at [[Hatley Park]] (used for several decades as [[Royal Roads Military College]], now civilian [[Royal Roads University]]) in the present City of [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]].\n[[File:Personnel of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve outside the British Columbia Legislature.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] members stand outside the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] in 1914.]]\nA real-estate and development boom ended just before [[World War I]], leaving Victoria with a large stock of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character. With the economic crash and a surplus of single men, Victoria became a target-rich environment for recruiting. Two militia infantry battalions, the 88th Victoria Fusiliers and the 50th Gordon Highlanders, formed in the immediate pre-war period. Victoria was the home of [[Sir Arthur Currie]].

[[Pleistocene glaciation]] put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam [[glacial till|till]]. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and [[gravel]]. Marine [[clay]] settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the [[British Columbia Coast]]. Their thick dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming until urbanization.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Victoria (Gonzales Marine)\n|  3.0 |  7.0 |  94.3\n|  3.7 |  8.6 |  71.7\n|  4.5 | 10.6 |  46.5\n|  6.0 | 13.1 |  28.5\n|  8.2 | 15.9 |  25.8\n| 10.0 | 17.9 |  20.7\n| 11.3 | 19.8 |  14.0\n| 11.7 | 20.1 |  19.7\n| 10.7 | 18.5 |  27.4\n|  7.9 | 13.8 |  51.2\n|  5.0 |  9.4 |  98.9\n|  3.2 |  7.1 | 108.9\n| float = right\n| clear = both\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Victoria Gonzales HTS, British Columbia | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 | publisher = Environment Canada | language = English, French | accessdate = 15 February 2013 | date = 2011-01-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130517080751/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | archive-date = 17 May 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>}}\n\nVictoria has a [[Warm-summer Mediterrean climate|warm summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62twqml5g?url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |archive-date=2 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> with fresh, dry summers and cool winters with frequent rainfall.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last         = Kottek\n |first        = M.\n |author2      = J.

The city has a distinct dry and rainy season, with two-thirds of its annual rainfall coming from November to February.]]\nOne feature of Victoria's climate is its distinct dry and rainy seasons. Nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, November to February. Precipitation in December, the wettest month ({{convert|109|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month ({{convert|14|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).<ref>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html Climate Normals & Averages | Canada's National Climate Archive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627223111/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html |date=27 June 2013 }}.

Roughly one third of winters see virtually no snow, with less than {{convert|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} falling during the entire season. When snow does fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or three days per year with at least {{convert|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} of snow on the ground. Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls including the record breaking {{convert|100|cm|1|abbr=on}} of snow that fell in December 1996. That amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada.\n\nWith 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually during the last available measurement period, Victoria was the second sunniest city in British Columbia after [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]]. In July 2013, Victoria received 432.8 hours of bright sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British Columbia history.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=5BA5EAFC-1&offset=12&toc=show#ru1 |title= Canada's Top Ten Weather Stories for 2013: Runner up Stories |publisher= Environment Canada |accessdate= 27 August 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151204023113/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=5BA5EAFC-1&offset=12&toc=show#ru1 |archive-date= 4 December 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nVictoria's equable climate has also added to its reputation as the \"City of Gardens\". The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there is an annual \"flower count\" in what for the rest of the country and most of the province is still the dead of winter.\n\nDue to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, [[Gulf Islands]], and parts of the [[Lower Mainland]] and [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]]) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including ''[[Quercus garryana]]'' (Garry oak), ''[[Arctostaphylos columbiana]]'' (hairy manzanita), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, ''[[Arbutus menziesii]]'' (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.\n\nNon-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm [[Trachycarpus fortunei]], which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/scazon/3616999233/?q=city |title=City hall Victoria palm |publisher=Flickr.com |date=10

However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid system as in Vancouver or [[Edmonton]], and even most major streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is little distinction between \"streets\" and \"avenues\" in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where \"streets\" run north\u2013south and \"avenues\" run east\u2013west, and Victorians are unlikely to use the terms \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\" when giving directions.\n[[File:Mile 0 Victoria B.C..jpg|thumb|left|The Mile Zero sign for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. Victoria is the western terminus for the highway.]]\nThe compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], as areas with significantly steep hills, such as one would find in San Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards a more \"green\", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designed for vehicles \"{{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=on}} or less\" in wheelbase size, thus fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as [[Smart Car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can expect to reach most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time span of 20 \u2013 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer during [[rush hour]] times due to large volume of traffic entering the downtown core in the morning and departing at evening rush hour.\n\nVictoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero is in the city's southern part at the corner of [[Douglas Street (Victoria, British Columbia)|Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road, where there is a small sign to mark the spot and a statue to honour [[Terry Fox]].\n\nWithin the Greater Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the majority of trips.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} However, the city boasts an excellent public transit system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid transit link to the suburban/rural western communities of Langford, Colwood, Metchosin and Sooke.\n\n=== Other services ===\nCoach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the [[Vancouver International Airport]] that includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by [http://bcfconnector.com/ Wilson's Transportation Limited]. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver International Airport (YVR)]]. Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.\n\nBus service from Victoria to points up island is run by [https://www.islandlinkbus.com/ Island Link Bus] or [http://www.tofinobus.com/ Tofino Bus]. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal at 700 Douglas Street, behind the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]] [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]] and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Hatley Castle BC.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Roads University]] is one of three universities in Greater Victoria.]]\nThe city of Victoria lies entirely within the [[Greater Victoria School District]].

The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] in 1774, and of [[James Cook]] in 1778. Although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not explored until 1790, Spanish sailors visited [[Esquimalt Harbour]] (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.\n\nIn 1841 [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] a new more northerly post be built in case [[Fort Vancouver]] fell into American hands (see [[Oregon boundary dispute]]). Douglas founded [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] on the site of present-day Victoria in anticipation of the outcome of the [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846, extending the [[British North America]]/United States border along the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:(1862) VICTORIA FROM JAMES' BAY LOOKING UP GOVERNMENT STREET.jpg|thumb|left|View of Victoria from [[James Bay, Greater Victoria|James Bay]] in 1862.

[[Robert Dunsmuir]], a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed [[Craigdarroch Castle]] in the [[Rockland, Greater Victoria|Rockland]] area, near the [[Government House (British Columbia)|official residence]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|province's Lieutenant Governor]]. His son [[James Dunsmuir]] became [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] and subsequently Lieutenant Governor of the province and built his own grand residence at [[Hatley Park]] (used for several decades as [[Royal Roads Military College]], now civilian [[Royal Roads University]]) in the present City of [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]].\n[[File:Personnel of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve outside the British Columbia Legislature.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] members stand outside the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] in 1914.]]\nA real-estate and development boom ended just before [[World War I]], leaving Victoria with a large stock of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character.

[[Pleistocene glaciation]] put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam [[glacial till|till]]. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and [[gravel]]. Marine [[clay]] settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the [[British Columbia Coast]]. Their thick dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming until urbanization.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Victoria (Gonzales Marine)\n|  3.0 |  7.0 |  94.3\n|  3.7 |  8.6 |  71.7\n|  4.5 | 10.6 |  46.5\n|  6.0 | 13.1 |  28.5\n|  8.2 | 15.9 |  25.8\n| 10.0 | 17.9 |  20.7\n| 11.3 | 19.8 |  14.0\n| 11.7 | 20.1 |  19.7\n| 10.7 | 18.5 |  27.4\n|  7.9 | 13.8 |  51.2\n|  5.0 |  9.4 |  98.9\n|  3.2 |  7.1 | 108.9\n| float = right\n| clear = both\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Victoria Gonzales HTS, British Columbia | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 | publisher = Environment Canada | language = English, French | accessdate = 15 February 2013 | date = 2011-01-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130517080751/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | archive-date = 17 May 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>}}\n\nVictoria has a [[Warm-summer Mediterrean climate|warm summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62twqml5g?url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |archive-date=2 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> with fresh, dry summers and cool winters with frequent rainfall.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last         = Kottek\n |first        = M.\n |author2      = J.

The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there is an annual \"flower count\" in what for the rest of the country and most of the province is still the dead of winter.\n\nDue to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, [[Gulf Islands]], and parts of the [[Lower Mainland]] and [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]]) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including ''[[Quercus garryana]]'' (Garry oak), ''[[Arctostaphylos columbiana]]'' (hairy manzanita), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, ''[[Arbutus menziesii]]'' (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.\n\nNon-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm [[Trachycarpus fortunei]], which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria.

The Cougars won the [[Stanley Cup]] as members of the [[Western Canada Hockey League|WCHL]] in 1925 after defeating the [[Montreal Canadiens]] [[1925 Stanley Cup Finals|three games to one in a best-of-five final]].  The Cougars were reincarnated in 1971 as a [[Victoria Cougars (WHL)|major junior hockey team]] in the [[Western Hockey League]], before they moved to [[Prince George, BC|Prince George]] to become the [[Prince George Cougars]]. Today, the Cougars name and legacy continue in the form of the Junior 'B' team that plays in the [[Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League]].  Minor professional hockey returned to Victoria in the form of the [[Victoria Salmon Kings]], which played in the [[ECHL]] from 2004 to 2011, and were a minor league affiliate of the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

[[BC Ferries]] provides service between Swartz Bay, up the Saanich peninsula from Victoria, to [[Tsawwassen]] on the Lower Mainland for cars, bus, trucks, pedestrians and cyclists. The [https://www.cohoferry.com/ Coho ferry] operates as a car and pedestrian/cyclist ferry between the inner harbour of Victoria and Port Angeles, Washington. The [[Clipper Navigation|Victoria Clipper]] is a passenger-only (no vehicles) [[ferry]] which operates daily, year-round between downtown Seattle and the inner harbour of Victoria. The [[Washington State Ferries]] runs a ferry for cars, pedestrians and cyclists between [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], [[Orcas Island]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]] in Washington State from the port at [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]], up the Saanich peninsula from Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/vesselwatch/terminaldetail.aspx?terminalid=19|title=WSDOT \u2013 Ferries \u2013 Sidney B.C.

Rider fare payments can be made in cash, monthly bus passes, disability yearly passes, day-passes purchased from the driver or tickets purchased from a store. As of April 1, 2016 bus drivers do not provide transfers as proof of payment.

However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid system as in Vancouver or [[Edmonton]], and even most major streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is little distinction between \"streets\" and \"avenues\" in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where \"streets\" run north\u2013south and \"avenues\" run east\u2013west, and Victorians are unlikely to use the terms \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\" when giving directions.\n[[File:Mile 0 Victoria B.C..jpg|thumb|left|The Mile Zero sign for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. Victoria is the western terminus for the highway.]]\nThe compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], as areas with significantly steep hills, such as one would find in San Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards a more \"green\", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designed for vehicles \"{{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=on}} or less\" in wheelbase size, thus fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as [[Smart Car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can expect to reach most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time span of 20 \u2013 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer during [[rush hour]] times due to large volume of traffic entering the downtown core in the morning and departing at evening rush hour.\n\nVictoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero is in the city's southern part at the corner of [[Douglas Street (Victoria, British Columbia)|Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road, where there is a small sign to mark the spot and a statue to honour [[Terry Fox]].\n\nWithin the Greater Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the majority of trips.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} However, the city boasts an excellent public transit system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid transit link to the suburban/rural western communities of Langford, Colwood, Metchosin and Sooke.\n\n=== Other services ===\nCoach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the [[Vancouver International Airport]] that includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by [http://bcfconnector.com/ Wilson's Transportation Limited]. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver International Airport (YVR)]]. Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.\n\nBus service from Victoria to points up island is run by [https://www.islandlinkbus.com/ Island Link Bus] or [http://www.tofinobus.com/ Tofino Bus]. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal at 700 Douglas Street, behind the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]] [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]] and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Hatley Castle BC.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Roads University]] is one of three universities in Greater Victoria.]]\nThe city of Victoria lies entirely within the [[Greater Victoria School District]]. There is one public high school within the city boundaries, [[Victoria High School (British Columbia)|Victoria High School]], founded in 1876, making it the oldest High School in North America north of [[Portland, Oregon]] and west of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Most of the elementary schools in Victoria now offer the popular [[French immersion]] programmes in addition to programmes in English. The educational needs of the Francophone community in Victoria are served by [[\u00c9cole Victor-Brodeur]] in the adjacent municipality of [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]]. In addition, within the city proper there are several smaller schools serving segments of the community such as the Chinese School in Chinatown and Christ Church Cathedral School. The senior campus of Glenlyon-Norfolk School is in the Oak Bay neighbourhood.\n\nThe ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]'', operates one Francophone school in the Victoria area: ''[[\u00e9cole Victor-Brodeur]]'' in [[Esquimalt]].

The University of Victoria is on the Saanich, Oak Bay border. Camosun College has two campuses, both of which are in Saanich. Royal Roads University is in Colwood.\n\n[[Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific]] is an international school, in [[Metchosin, British Columbia|Metchosin]], a municipality to the west of Victoria. There are also several private vocational and English ([[ESL]]) training schools available for people who want to learn the English language or upgrade new job market skills. [[Sprott Shaw College]] is a private career training institution that has had a campus in Victoria since 1913.\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Victoria, British Columbia}}\n\nVictoria is the only Canadian provincial capital without a local [[CBC Television]] station, owned-and-operated or affiliate, although it does host a small [[CBC Radio]] station in the 700 block of Kings Road. The region is considered to be a part of the [[Media in Vancouver#Television|Vancouver television market]], receiving most stations that broadcast from across the [[Strait of Georgia]], including the [[CBUT-DT|CBC]], [[CIVT-DT|CTV]], [[CKVU-DT|Citytv]] and [[CHAN-DT|Global]] affiliates.

San Jose is shaken by moderate earthquakes on average one or two times a year. These quakes originate just east of the city on the creeping section of the Calaveras Fault, which is a major source of earthquake activity in Northern California. On April 14, 1984, at 1:15&nbsp;pm local time, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Calaveras Fault near San Jose's Mount Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Nature and Tectonic Significance of Fault Zone Weakening|author=R.

[[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|Right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]\nSeveral state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].\n\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.\n\nThe interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet, has been known to have high-density traffic similar to [[Los Angeles County]] interchanges. It was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, with no on-ramps or off-ramps stood over U.S. 101 at a 110-foot tall during the 70's, before opening in 1981.

Mineta San Jose International Airport]] {{airport codes|SJC|KSJC|SJC}}, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} northwest of downtown, and by [[Reid-Hillview Airport|Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County]] {{airport codes||KRHV|RHV}} a [[general aviation]] airport located in the eastern part of San Jose. San Jose residents also use [[San Francisco International Airport]] {{Airport codes|SFO|KSFO|SFO}}, a major international hub located {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the northwest, and [[Oakland International Airport]] {{Airport codes|OAK|KOAK|OAK}}, another major international airport located {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the north. The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]], [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]], and [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]].\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe San Jose area has a large freeway system, including three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate freeways]] and one [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Route]]. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network [[Interstate Highway System#Planning|was planned]] by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.\n\n[[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] runs south to the [[California Central Coast]] and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] to San Francisco. [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|Right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]\nSeveral state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].\n\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.\n\nThe interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet, has been known to have high-density traffic similar to [[Los Angeles County]] interchanges. It was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, with no on-ramps or off-ramps stood over U.S. 101 at a 110-foot tall during the 70's, before opening in 1981. In 2010, the interchange was named the [[Joe Colla Interchange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |title=Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 102 \u2013 Joe Colla Interchange |publisher=California State Legislature |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181018/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Major highways:'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[File:I-280 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]]\n* [[File:I-680 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]]\n* [[File:I-880 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]]\n* [[File:US 101 (1961 cutout).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]]\n* [[File:California 17.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]]\n* [[File:California 82.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 82|State Route 82]]\n* [[File:California 85.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 85|State Route 85]]\n* [[File:California 87.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]]\n* [[File:California 130.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 130|State Route 130]]\n* [[File:California 237.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Bicycling ===\n{{main|Cycling in San Jose, California}}\nCentral San Jose has seen a gradual expansion of bike lanes over the past decade, which now comprise a network of car-traffic-separated and buffered bike lanes.

These trails extend from near downtown San Jose for dozens of miles to the north and south, and are connected with each other via bicycle routes of varying quality. The city is planning to construct new trail extensions in coming years including the Three Creeks Trail and San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{main|List of people from San Jose, California}}\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSan Jose has one of the oldest [[Twin towns and Sister cities|Sister City programs]] in the nation.

Robinson scored 1320 on the [[SAT]], and chose to go to the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he majored in mathematics.\n\n==College basketball career and military service==\n[[File:US-O2 insignia.svg|left|thumb|50px|Robinson achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]] while serving in the [[U.S. Navy]].]]\nDavid Robinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history.<ref>According to the following article about the city of Annapolis, Robinson won the \"Eastman Award\" in 1987 and the award is in Lejeune Hall. {{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Steve |title=In Annapolis, Md., the Past Is Always at Hand |work=New York Times |date=August 22, 2008 |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/travel/escapes/22american.html |accessdate=March 18, 2010}} See also the footnote at [[United States Naval Academy#Halls and principal buildings]] (at \"Lejeune Hall\").</ref> He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol [[Ralph Sampson]].

Wooden Award|Wooden Awards]], as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under [[Paul Evans (basketball coach)|Paul Evans]] (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|University of Georgia]] interim Head Coach [[Pete Herrmann]]. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the [[1987 NBA draft]] and was selected by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.\n\nRobinson was 6&nbsp;ft. 8&nbsp;in. when he was admitted to the Naval Academy, two inches above the height limit, but received a waiver from the [[List of Superintendents of the United States Naval Academy|Superintendent of the Academy]]. Robinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an [[unrestricted line officer]], which would be detrimental to his naval career, and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Lehman]] allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the [[Civil Engineer Corps]]. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] and was only required to serve an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name=\"gao198709\">{{cite web | url=http://gao.justia.com/department-of-defense/1987/9/military-personnel-nsiad-87-224/NSIAD-87-224-full-report.pdf | title=Treatment of Prominent Athletes on Active Duty | publisher=United States General Accounting Office | date=September 1987 | accessdate=March 28, 2012 | author=Report to the Honorable Gordon J.

The Spurs leaped to a record of 56\u201326 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[1990 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Following the 1989\u201390 season, he was unanimously named the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA rookie of the year]], and subsequently [[Sega]] produced a game featuring him entitled ''[[David Robinson's Supreme Court]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/david-robinsons-supreme-court|title=David Robinson's Supreme Court for Genesis (1992)|website=MobyGames}}</ref>\nThe Spurs made the playoffs seven more seasons in a row. Robinson also made the [[United States men's national basketball team#1992 Olympics (Barcelona) \u2013 The Dream Team|1992 US Olympic Dream Team]] that won the gold medal in [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]]. During the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with [[Shaquille O'Neal]], scoring 71 points (breaking [[George Gervin]]'s single-game franchise record of 63) against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to win it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199404240LAC.html|title=San Antonio Spurs at Los Angeles Clippers Box Score, April 24, 1994|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref> In that season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.html|title=David Robinson Stats|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nRobinson went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html |title=The NBA at 50 |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2012}}</ref> Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nEarly in the 1997 season, Robinson's dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably [[Sean Elliott]], who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20\u201362 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery\u2014and with it, the first pick in the next year's NBA draft. They used that pick to select [[Tim Duncan]] out of [[Wake Forest University]], who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson's quest for an NBA title.\n\n===Championship season===\nBefore the start of the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], the NBA owners and NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|locked out]] the NBA Players' Association to force negotiations on a new [[Collective Bargaining Agreement]]. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37\u201313, giving them the home-court advantage throughout [[1999 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].\n\nThe Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] by a combined record of 11\u20131 to reach the [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the first time ever. In the Finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Tim Duncan]] proved overpowering, and the Spurs beat the [[New York Knicks]] in five games to become the first former [[American Basketball Association]] team to win an NBA title.

played [[center (basketball)|center]] for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) for his entire career. Based on his prior service as an officer in the [[United States Navy]], Robinson earned the nickname \"'''The Admiral'''\".\n\nRobinson is a 10-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]], the 1995 [[NBA MVP]], a two-time [[NBA champion]] (1999 and 2003), a two-time [[Olympic Gold Medal]] winner (1992, 1996), a two-time [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductee (2009 for his individual career, 2010 as a member of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]]), and a two-time [[U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame]] inductee (2008 individually, 2009 as a member of the 1992 Olympic team).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/1992-united-states-olympic-team|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818075707/http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/1992-united-states-olympic-team|url-status=dead|title=1992 United States Olympic Team|archivedate=August 18, 2010}}</ref> He is widely considered one of the greatest centers in both college basketball and NBA history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-greatestcenters |title=The game's greatest giants ever |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 25, 2011 }}</ref> To date, Robinson is the only player from the Naval Academy to play in the NBA.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Robinson was born in [[Key West, Florida]], the second child of Ambrose and Freda Robinson. Since Robinson's father was in the Navy, the family moved many times. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. He was 5&nbsp;feet, 9&nbsp;inches tall in junior high school; he tried his hand at basketball, but soon quit. Robinson attended [[Osbourn Park High School]] in [[Manassas, Virginia]], just outside Washington, D.C., where Robinson's father was working as an engineer.\n\nBy his senior year in high school he was 6&nbsp;feet, 6&nbsp;inches tall, weighed 175 pounds, and had not played organized basketball or attended any basketball camps.{{r|montville19960429}} When the coach added the tall senior to the basketball team, Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches. Robinson scored 1320 on the [[SAT]], and chose to go to the [[United States Naval Academy]], where he majored in mathematics.\n\n==College basketball career and military service==\n[[File:US-O2 insignia.svg|left|thumb|50px|Robinson achieved the rank of [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]] while serving in the [[U.S. Navy]].]]\nDavid Robinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history.<ref>According to the following article about the city of Annapolis, Robinson won the \"Eastman Award\" in 1987 and the award is in Lejeune Hall. {{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Steve |title=In Annapolis, Md., the Past Is Always at Hand |work=New York Times |date=August 22, 2008 |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/travel/escapes/22american.html |accessdate=March 18, 2010}} See also the footnote at [[United States Naval Academy#Halls and principal buildings]] (at \"Lejeune Hall\").</ref> He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol [[Ralph Sampson]].

Wooden Award|Wooden Awards]], as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under [[Paul Evans (basketball coach)|Paul Evans]] (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|University of Georgia]] interim Head Coach [[Pete Herrmann]]. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the [[1987 NBA draft]] and was selected by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.\n\nRobinson was 6&nbsp;ft. 8&nbsp;in. when he was admitted to the Naval Academy, two inches above the height limit, but received a waiver from the [[List of Superintendents of the United States Naval Academy|Superintendent of the Academy]]. Robinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an [[unrestricted line officer]], which would be detrimental to his naval career, and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Lehman]] allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the [[Civil Engineer Corps]]. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the [[United States Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] and was only required to serve an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name=\"gao198709\">{{cite web | url=http://gao.justia.com/department-of-defense/1987/9/military-personnel-nsiad-87-224/NSIAD-87-224-full-report.pdf | title=Treatment of Prominent Athletes on Active Duty | publisher=United States General Accounting Office | date=September 1987 | accessdate=March 28, 2012 | author=Report to the Honorable Gordon J.

During the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with [[Shaquille O'Neal]], scoring 71 points (breaking [[George Gervin]]'s single-game franchise record of 63) against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] to win it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199404240LAC.html|title=San Antonio Spurs at Los Angeles Clippers Box Score, April 24, 1994|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref> In that season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.html|title=David Robinson Stats|website=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nRobinson went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html |title=The NBA at 50 |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2012}}</ref> Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nEarly in the 1997 season, Robinson's dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat, and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably [[Sean Elliott]], who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20\u201362 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery\u2014and with it, the first pick in the next year's NBA draft. They used that pick to select [[Tim Duncan]] out of [[Wake Forest University]], who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson's quest for an NBA title.\n\n===Championship season===\nBefore the start of the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]], the NBA owners and NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] [[1998\u201399 NBA lockout|locked out]] the NBA Players' Association to force negotiations on a new [[Collective Bargaining Agreement]]. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37\u201313, giving them the home-court advantage throughout [[1999 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].\n\nThe Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] by a combined record of 11\u20131 to reach the [[1999 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the first time ever. In the Finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Tim Duncan]] proved overpowering, and the Spurs beat the [[New York Knicks]] in five games to become the first former [[American Basketball Association]] team to win an NBA title. Duncan was named Finals MVP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19981999.html |title=Spurs Tower Over NBA |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106093310/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19981999.html |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRobinson and Duncan were nicknamed [[Twin Towers (San Antonio Spurs)|\"The Twin Towers\"]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/top-moments/2003-spurs-championship-duncan-robinson|title=Top Moments: Twin Towers ride off to sunset with another title|first=NBA com|last=Staff|website=NBA.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hoopshype.com/2018/03/23/david-robinson-tim-duncan-is-probably-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-me/|title=David Robinson: \"Tim Duncan is probably the best thing that ever happened to me\"|date=March 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Twilight years and second championship===\nThe later years of Robinson's career were plagued by back ailments.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2003-06-08-0306080170-story.html|title='Admiral' Robinson isn't one to pull rank|first=Milton|last=Kent|website=baltimoresun.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/252629-honoring-david-robinson|title=Honoring David Robinson|first=Matthew|last=Mooney|website=Bleacher Report}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 1999-00 season, Robinson averaged 17.8 points per game, 10.0 rebounds per game and 2.3 blocks per game in 80 games.

China has had ambitions to operate aircraft carriers since the 1970s, but at that time had never owned or operated an aircraft carrier before. Since 1985, China has acquired four retired aircraft carriers for study: the Australian {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} and the ex-[[Soviet]] carriers {{ship|Soviet aircraft carrier|Minsk||2}}, {{ship|Soviet aircraft carrier|Kiev||2}} and {{ship|Soviet aircraft carrier|Varyag||2}}. The ''Varyag'' later underwent an extensive refit to be converted into the ''Liaoning'', China's first operational aircraft carrier, which also served as a basis for China's subsequent design iterations. {{as of|2018}}, the PLAN has two combat-ready aircraft carriers, the {{ship|Chinese aircraft carrier|Liaoning||2}} and {{ship|Chinese aircraft carrier|Shandong||2}}, with the third under construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2018/01/23/no-slowdown-for-chinas-navy-aspirations/|title=No slowdown for China's Navy aspirations|date=23 January 2018}}</ref> It is projected that China may possess five or six aircraft carriers by the 2030s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iiss.org/blogs/military-balance/2018/06/china-carrier-aviation-development|title=China's carrier-aviation developments: making a difference|website=IISS}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early ambitions ===\nSince the 1970s, the PLAN has expressed interest in operating an [[aircraft carrier]] as part of its [[blue-water navy|blue water]] aspirations.<ref name=\"chinadaily\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-03/23/content_7607571.htm|title=Japan defense minister's China visit a sign of warming relations|author1=Wang Jianfen|author2=Nie Ligao|date=23 March 2009|publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101082200/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-03/23/content_7607571.htm|archive-date=1 January 2018|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> The first official plan of [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLAN]] aircraft carrier development dated back on 31 March 1987 when the [[Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense]] approved the plan on the aircraft carrier and the next generation [[nuclear submarine]] for PLAN advocated and submitted by the then commander-in-chief of PLAN, [[Liu Huaqing]]. The original plan was to be progressed in stages, with basic research to be completed by the end of the [[Five-Year Plans of China#The Seventh Five-Year Plan, 1986-1990|7th 5-year plan]], and development of the platform and aircraft to be completed by the end of the [[Five-Year Plans of China#The Eighth Five-Year Plan, 1991-1995|8th 5-year plan]].

As a result, the plan was drastically scaled back to basic research level and the date for an aircraft carrier entering PLAN service was postponed and eventually put on hold. In the meantime, pilot candidates for warship captain training was also altered, with candidates switched to ship-borne helicopter pilots, because it was considered that naval helicopter pilots with much more ship-borne aviation experience would be better prepared than the land-based jet fighter pilots who lack ship-borne aviation experience.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== Acquisition of HMAS ''Melbourne'' ===\nChina acquired the [[Royal Australian Navy|Royal Australian Navy's]] decommissioned aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} in February 1985, when it was sold to the China United Shipbuilding Company to be towed to China and broken up for scrap.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Commander David|date=October 2007|title=HMAS ''Melbourne'' (II) \u2013 25 Years On|journal=The Navy|volume=69|issue=4|pages=5\u20139|issn=1322-6231}}</ref> Prior to the ship's departure for China, the RAN stripped ''Melbourne'' of all electronic equipment and weapons, and welded her rudders into a fixed position so that she could not be reactivated.

For example, [[South San Francisco]] (population about 65,000) is not considered a twin city with [[San Francisco]] (population about 850,000). However, cities considered twinned by proximity do not necessarily match demographically, economically, or politically.\n\nIn many historical cases, cities that grew into each other's space lost their individual identities, and the border or barrier originally separating them became almost irrelevant. An 1873 case of twin cities merging to become a united city is [[Budapest]] in Hungary, which began as two settlements ([[Buda]] and [[Pest (city)|Pest]]) facing each other across the [[Danube]] at a strategic [[ford (crossing)|fording place]] along a trade route.  In China, the three ancient cities of [[Hankou]], [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], and [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], separated by the junction of the [[Yangtze]] and [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Hanjiang]] rivers, were joined in 1927 into the single entity of [[Wuhan]].\n\nTwin cities may share an airport into whose [[IATA airport code|airport codes]] are integrated the component initials, e.g., [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth International Airport|DFW]] ([[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]]), [[Leeds Bradford Airport|LBA]] ([[Leeds]]&ndash;[[Bradford]]), [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|MSP]] ([[Minneapolis]]&ndash;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]), [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport|RDU]] ([[Raleigh]] and [[Durham, NC]]), and [[Akron\u2013Canton Airport|CAK]] ([[Akron]]\u2013[[Canton, Ohio]]).\n\nIn some cases, such as [[Albury]]/[[Wodonga]] in Australia, the two cities are permanently divided by a state border, often one that strictly adheres to a geographical landmark, such as the [[Murray River]] that divides [[New South Wales]] from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and thus Albury from Wodonga. In other cases twin cities can be divided by an international border, but retain a cultural and historical similarity, for example [[Haparanda]] ([[Sweden]]) and [[Tornio]] ([[Finland]]), [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] ([[Colombia]]) and [[Tabatinga]] ([[Brazil]]) or [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]] ([[Estonia]]) and [[Valka]] ([[Latvia]]).\n\n== Examples ==\n[[Image:Obelisco - Plaza Internacional - Frontera de la Paz - Livramento - Rivera.jpeg|thumb|right|Cross-border example of twin cities: ''Plaza Internacional'' of the ''Frontera de la Paz''.

In 1930, the two towns were reunited as a single town under the shared jurisdiction of both provinces, and Lloydminster was reincorporated as a single city in 1958.\n* [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] (Canada) were forcibly merged in 1996 along with [[Bedford, Nova Scotia|Bedford]] and [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] to create the [[Halifax Regional Municipality]].\n* [[Saguenay, Quebec]] ([[Chicoutimi]], [[Jonqui\u00e8re]], et al.)\n* [[Bellingham, Washington]] was formed from four cities, [[Fairhaven, Washington|Fairhaven]], Sehome, Bellingham and Whatcom.\n* [[Lincoln City, Oregon]] was formed in 1965 by merging the extant seaside towns of Oceanlake, Delake, and Taft, with the adjoining unincorporated areas of Nelscott and Cutler City.\n* [[Pittsburgh]] annexed [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]], which is now the [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|quarter of the city]] that lies north of the Allegheny and Ohio rivers. Also annexed was Birmingham, now referred to as the \"South Side\".\n* [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], which absorbed the cities of South Bethlehem, and West Bethlehem.  The former Bethlehem and South Bethlehem are situated in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], and West Bethlehem is in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]].  As a result, present-day Bethlehem straddles the county line.\n* [[Montreal]], Quebec, was merged with the other 27 communities on the Island of Montreal by an act in the Quebec Parliament in 2002.  Following a change in the provincial government, several communities later voted via referendum to de-merge and there are now a total of 15, leaving Montreal merged with the other 12.\n* [[Kingston, Ontario]] was amalgamated in 1998 with the neighboring Kingston and Pittsburgh Townships.\n* [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] amalgamated with [[Subdivisions of Winnipeg#Unicity|12 surrounding municipalities]] and its [[Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg|metropolitan corporation]] in 1971 under what was referred to as [[Amalgamation of Winnipeg|unicity]] reforms in local government restructuring.\n* [[Park Hills, Missouri]] was formed in 1994 by a four-way municipal merger involving the cities of Flat River, Elvins, and Esther, plus the village of Rivermines.\n* [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas]] was formed in 2006 by the merger of the previous cities of [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] and [[West Helena, Arkansas|West Helena]].\n* [[Greater Sudbury]], Ontario, was formed in 2001 by the amalgamation of the former [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]], comprising the municipalities of [[Urban neighbourhoods of Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Nickel Centre]], [[Valley East]], [[Capreol]], [[Rayside-Balfour]], [[Onaping Falls]] and [[Walden, Ontario|Walden]], plus a number of previously unamalgamated townships. The amalgamation made it the most populous city in the [[Northern Ontario]] region.\n* [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] is made up of the former towns of Boston, Dorchester, Brighton, Roxbury, Charlestown, and Hyde Park.\n* [[Port Alberni, British Columbia]] was formed in 1967 when Alberni and Port Alberni, merged to become one city.\n* [[Iron River, Michigan]] absorbed the nearby city of [[Stambaugh, Michigan|Stambaugh]] and village of [[Mineral Hills, Michigan|Mineral Hills]] in July 2000.\n\n== Fictional twin cities ==\n* [[Gotham City]] (the home of [[Batman]]) and [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] (the home of [[Superman]]) have sometimes been presented as twin cities, mainly in 1970s and 1980s stories by [[DC Comics]]. In stories presenting them as twin cities, Gotham City and Metropolis are located on opposite sides of a large [[bay]] (identified as [[Delaware Bay]] in 1990's ''[[The Atlas of the DC Universe]]''), with both cities linked by the Metro-Narrows Bridge,<ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' #451, [[DC Comics]], September 1975</ref> a [[suspension bridge]] resembling New York City's [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]].<ref>''New Adventures of [[Superboy]]'' #22, [[DC Comics]], October 1981</ref><ref>''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #259, [[DC Comics]], October\u2013November 1979</ref>\n* [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] and [[Keystone City]], from the current [[Flash (comics)|''Flash'' comics]], are shown as twin cities.

For example, [[South San Francisco]] (population about 65,000) is not considered a twin city with [[San Francisco]] (population about 850,000). However, cities considered twinned by proximity do not necessarily match demographically, economically, or politically.\n\nIn many historical cases, cities that grew into each other's space lost their individual identities, and the border or barrier originally separating them became almost irrelevant. An 1873 case of twin cities merging to become a united city is [[Budapest]] in Hungary, which began as two settlements ([[Buda]] and [[Pest (city)|Pest]]) facing each other across the [[Danube]] at a strategic [[ford (crossing)|fording place]] along a trade route.  In China, the three ancient cities of [[Hankou]], [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], and [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], separated by the junction of the [[Yangtze]] and [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Hanjiang]] rivers, were joined in 1927 into the single entity of [[Wuhan]].\n\nTwin cities may share an airport into whose [[IATA airport code|airport codes]] are integrated the component initials, e.g., [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth International Airport|DFW]] ([[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]]), [[Leeds Bradford Airport|LBA]] ([[Leeds]]&ndash;[[Bradford]]), [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|MSP]] ([[Minneapolis]]&ndash;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]), [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport|RDU]] ([[Raleigh]] and [[Durham, NC]]), and [[Akron\u2013Canton Airport|CAK]] ([[Akron]]\u2013[[Canton, Ohio]]).\n\nIn some cases, such as [[Albury]]/[[Wodonga]] in Australia, the two cities are permanently divided by a state border, often one that strictly adheres to a geographical landmark, such as the [[Murray River]] that divides [[New South Wales]] from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and thus Albury from Wodonga. In other cases twin cities can be divided by an international border, but retain a cultural and historical similarity, for example [[Haparanda]] ([[Sweden]]) and [[Tornio]] ([[Finland]]), [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] ([[Colombia]]) and [[Tabatinga]] ([[Brazil]]) or [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]] ([[Estonia]]) and [[Valka]] ([[Latvia]]).\n\n== Examples ==\n[[Image:Obelisco - Plaza Internacional - Frontera de la Paz - Livramento - Rivera.jpeg|thumb|right|Cross-border example of twin cities: ''Plaza Internacional'' of the ''Frontera de la Paz''.

In 1930, the two towns were reunited as a single town under the shared jurisdiction of both provinces, and Lloydminster was reincorporated as a single city in 1958.\n* [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] (Canada) were forcibly merged in 1996 along with [[Bedford, Nova Scotia|Bedford]] and [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax County]] to create the [[Halifax Regional Municipality]].\n* [[Saguenay, Quebec]] ([[Chicoutimi]], [[Jonqui\u00e8re]], et al.)\n* [[Bellingham, Washington]] was formed from four cities, [[Fairhaven, Washington|Fairhaven]], Sehome, Bellingham and Whatcom.\n* [[Lincoln City, Oregon]] was formed in 1965 by merging the extant seaside towns of Oceanlake, Delake, and Taft, with the adjoining unincorporated areas of Nelscott and Cutler City.\n* [[Pittsburgh]] annexed [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]], which is now the [[North Side (Pittsburgh)|quarter of the city]] that lies north of the Allegheny and Ohio rivers. Also annexed was Birmingham, now referred to as the \"South Side\".\n* [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], which absorbed the cities of South Bethlehem, and West Bethlehem.  The former Bethlehem and South Bethlehem are situated in [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]], and West Bethlehem is in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]].  As a result, present-day Bethlehem straddles the county line.\n* [[Montreal]], Quebec, was merged with the other 27 communities on the Island of Montreal by an act in the Quebec Parliament in 2002.  Following a change in the provincial government, several communities later voted via referendum to de-merge and there are now a total of 15, leaving Montreal merged with the other 12.\n* [[Kingston, Ontario]] was amalgamated in 1998 with the neighboring Kingston and Pittsburgh Townships.\n* [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] amalgamated with [[Subdivisions of Winnipeg#Unicity|12 surrounding municipalities]] and its [[Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg|metropolitan corporation]] in 1971 under what was referred to as [[Amalgamation of Winnipeg|unicity]] reforms in local government restructuring.\n* [[Park Hills, Missouri]] was formed in 1994 by a four-way municipal merger involving the cities of Flat River, Elvins, and Esther, plus the village of Rivermines.\n* [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas]] was formed in 2006 by the merger of the previous cities of [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] and [[West Helena, Arkansas|West Helena]].\n* [[Greater Sudbury]], Ontario, was formed in 2001 by the amalgamation of the former [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]], comprising the municipalities of [[Urban neighbourhoods of Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Nickel Centre]], [[Valley East]], [[Capreol]], [[Rayside-Balfour]], [[Onaping Falls]] and [[Walden, Ontario|Walden]], plus a number of previously unamalgamated townships. The amalgamation made it the most populous city in the [[Northern Ontario]] region.\n* [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] is made up of the former towns of Boston, Dorchester, Brighton, Roxbury, Charlestown, and Hyde Park.\n* [[Port Alberni, British Columbia]] was formed in 1967 when Alberni and Port Alberni, merged to become one city.\n* [[Iron River, Michigan]] absorbed the nearby city of [[Stambaugh, Michigan|Stambaugh]] and village of [[Mineral Hills, Michigan|Mineral Hills]] in July 2000.\n\n== Fictional twin cities ==\n* [[Gotham City]] (the home of [[Batman]]) and [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] (the home of [[Superman]]) have sometimes been presented as twin cities, mainly in 1970s and 1980s stories by [[DC Comics]].

It attacked military installations in France in early 1944 to help prepare the way for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, and on [[D Day]] hit [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]], [[artillery batteries]] and transportation targets.  It attacked troop concentrations and supply depots.  In July 1944, it supported [[Operation Cobra]] at [[Saint Lo]] and the following month attacked targets in [[Caen]].  It struck military installations and airfields near [[Arnhem]] duing [[Operation Market Garden]], the unsuccessful attempt to secure a bridgehead across the [[Rhine]] in the Netherlands.  It attacked transportation targets to support the final drive through Germany in early 1045.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\n====Return and inactivation====\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission in April 1945.  After [[V-E Day]], the squadron flew missions to the Netherlands to drop food in flooded areas.  It then began redeploying to the United States.  Its aircraft left Knettishall between 9 June and 5 July 1945.  The ground echelon sailed again on the ''Queen Elizabeth'' on 5 August.

It deployed to South Korea in response to [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)#''Pueblo'' incident|North Korea's capture of the USS Pueblo]] in June 1969.  After maintaining [[alert status]] in Korea and later Japan, the squadron returned to Homestead, where it was inactivated in October 1970,<ref name=560FTSHistory/> and its personnel and equipment were transferred to the [[309th Tactical Fighter Squadron]].\n\n===Pilot training===\nOn 1 May 1972, the 560th was reactivated as the '''560th Flying Training Squadron''' at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas, and took over the mission of training [[Northrop T-38 Talon]] instructor pilots for [[Air Training Command]]'s Undergraduate Pilot Training bases.<ref name=560FTSHistory/>\n\nAfter 1973, all repatriated [[U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War|Vietnam era prisoner of war]] (POW) pilots physically able to return to active flying duty came to the 560th for requalification training.

Over the next two years the 560th flew more than 6000 hours and established a lasting bond that it still maintains with these former POWs.<ref name=560FTSHistory/>\n\nIn October 1993, the 560th added the missions of Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals and Upgrade Instructor Pilot Training in the \"Smurf Jet\" AT-38.  In May 1998, the Smurf operation had become squadron-sized and was split off to reactivate the [[435th Fighter Training Squadron]].
