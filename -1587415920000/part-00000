About a week after the initial symptoms subsided, the second phase of the disease sets in, and patients experience severe coughing and shortness of breath as the lungs fill with fluid.

The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nWould you like a chocolate finger? The town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]).

The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]).

Manufactured by [[STMicroelectronics]].]]\n\nThe '''ARM Cortex-M''' is a group of [[32-bit]] [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor cores licensed by [[Arm Holdings]].  These cores are optimized for low-cost and energy-efficient microcontrollers, which have been embedded in tens of billions of consumer devices.<ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m ARM Cortex-M website; arm.com]</ref>   The cores consist of the Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M33, Cortex-M35P, Cortex-M55.<ref name=\"M0-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M0+-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M1-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M3-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M4-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M7-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M23-TRM\"/>  The Cortex-M4 / M7 / M33 / M35P / M55 cores have an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]] silicon option, and when included in the silicon these cores are sometimes known as \"Cortex-Mx with FPU\" or \"Cortex-MxF\", where 'x' is the core number.\n\n==Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:9px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Announced\n|-\n! Year !! Core\n|-\n| 2004 || [[#Cortex-M3|Cortex-M3]]\n|-\n| 2007 || [[#Cortex-M1|Cortex-M1]]\n|-\n| 2009 || [[#Cortex-M0|Cortex-M0]]\n|-\n| 2010 || [[#Cortex-M4|Cortex-M4]]\n|-\n| 2012 || [[#Cortex-M0+|Cortex-M0+]]\n|-\n| 2014 || [[#Cortex-M7|Cortex-M7]]\n|-\n| 2016 || [[#Cortex-M23|Cortex-M23]]\n|-\n| 2016 || [[#Cortex-M33|Cortex-M33]]\n|-\n| 2018 || [[#Cortex-M35P|Cortex-M35P]]\n|-\n| 2020 || [[#Cortex-M55|Cortex-M55]]\n|}\n{{See also|ARM architecture|List of ARM cores}}\n\nThe ARM Cortex-M family are ARM microprocessor cores which are designed for use in [[microcontroller]]s, [[ASIC]]s, [[application-specific integrated circuit#Application-specific standard product|ASSP]]s, [[FPGA]]s, and [[system on a chip|SoC]]s.  Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.

A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

Legacy cores allowed \"on-the-fly\" changing of the data [[endianness|endian]] mode.\n* [[Coprocessor|Co-processor]] were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n\nThe capabilities of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is duplicated in many ways by the Thumb-1 and Thumb-2 instruction sets, but some ARM features don't have a similar feature:\n* The SWP and SWPB (swap) ARM instructions don't have a similar feature in Cortex-M.\n\nThe 16-bit Thumb-1 instruction set has evolved over time since it was first released in the legacy [[ARM7|ARM7T]] cores with the ARMv4T architecture.  New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same. However, the SVC handler code is different from the SWI handler code, because of changes to the exception models.\n\n==Cortex-M0==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1]] (most),<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2]] (some)\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n\nThe Cortex-M0 core is optimized for small silicon die size and use in the lowest price chips.\n\nKey features of the Cortex-M0 core are:<ref name=\"M0-TRM\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/DDI0432C_cortex_m0_r0p0_trm.pdf Cortex-M0 r0p0 Technical Reference Manual; Arm Holdings.]</ref>\n* ARMv6-M architecture<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/>\n* 3-stage [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]\n* Instruction sets:\n** Thumb-1 (most), missing CBZ, CBNZ, IT\n** Thumb-2 (some), only BL, DMB, DSB, ISB, MRS, MSR\n** 32-bit hardware integer multiply with 32-bit result\n* 1 to 32 [[interrupt]]s, plus [[non-maskable interrupt|NMI]]\n\n'''Silicon options:'''\n* Hardware integer multiply speed: 1 or 32 cycles.\n\n===Chips===\nThe following microcontrollers are based on the Cortex-M0 core:\n* ABOV Semiconductor AC30M1x64\n* [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress]] PSoC 4000, 4100, 4100M, 4200, 4200DS, 4200L, 4200M \n* [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] [[Infineon XMC|XMC1100]], XMC1200, XMC1300, XMC1400, TLE984x\n*[[Dialog Semiconductor]] DA1458x, DA1468x\n* [[Nordic Semiconductor|Nordic]] [[nRF51]]\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC1100]], [[LPC1200]]\n* [[Nuvoton|nuvoTon]] NuMicro M0 Family\n* Sonix SN32F700\n* [[STMicroelectronics|ST]] [[STM32#STM32 F0|STM32 F0]]\n* [[Toshiba]] TX00\n* Vorago VA10800 (extreme temperature), VA10820 (radiation hardened)\n\nThe following chips have a Cortex-M0 as a secondary core:\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC4300]] (one Cortex-M4F + one Cortex-M0)\n* [[Texas Instruments]] SimpleLink Wireless MCUs CC1310 and CC2650 (one programmable Cortex-M3 + one Cortex-M0 network processor + one proprietary Sensor Controller Engine)\n\n==Cortex-M0+==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0+\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1 (most)]],<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2 (some)]]\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n[[File:Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board with KL25Z128VLK (ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU).JPG|thumb|right| [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] ([[Freescale]]) FRDM-KL25Z Board with KL25Z128VLK (Kinetis L)]]\nThe Cortex-M0+ is an optimized superset of the Cortex-M0.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\" (see [[Crimson Contagion]]).<ref name= simulation2019>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-let-u-fall-behind-120054883.html|title=How Trump let the U.S. fall behind the curve on coronavirus threat|website=news.yahoo.com}}</ref> Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

He began his career by writing two works of historical fiction in the 1990s, later turning to non-fiction, and has since written several critically acclaimed and best-selling historical works.\n\n==Career and works==\nKing was born in [[Estevan]], Saskatchewan, Canada and was raised in the nearby village of [[North Portal]].  He received his undergraduate university education at the [[University of Regina]], where in 1984 he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in English Literature.  Continuing his studies at the University of Regina, he received a Master of Arts degree in 1986 upon completing a thesis on the poet [[T. S. Eliot]].  Later he achieved a PhD from [[York University]] in Toronto (1992), where he specialized in eighteenth-century English literature.\n\nKing moved to England to take up a position as a post-doctoral research fellow at [[University College London]].  It was at this time that he began writing his first novel.\n\nKing's first novel, ''Domino'', (1995), tells the story of a castrato singer seen through the experience of an aspiring painter in the London of the 1770s.\n\nIn 1998, King published ''Ex-Libris'', his second work of historical fiction.  Set in London and Prague, it chronicles how a London bookseller's search in the 1660s for a missing manuscript leads him unwittingly into a world of deception and murder.\n\n''Brunelleschi's Dome: The Story of the Great Cathedral in Florence'' (2000) describes how the Italian architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] designed what still stands as the largest masonry dome ever built: the dome of the cathedral of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]], completed in 1436.  ''Brunelleschi's Dome'' marked King's transition from novelist to writer of art histories and biographies.<ref name=Globe>{{cite news|last=Barber|first=John|title=Writer Ross King : 'I\u2019m not interested in making things up'|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/writer-ross-king-im-not-interested-in-making-things-up/article5368277/|accessdate=January 30, 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=November 16, 2012}}</ref>  ''Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling,'' (2002), follows the four arduous years during which [[Michelangelo]] painted the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] amid the political and religious intrigues of early sixteenth-century Rome.\n\nKing's next book, ''The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade That Gave the World Impressionism'' (2006), was met by much critical acclaim and considerable commercial success.

He began his career by writing two works of historical fiction in the 1990s, later turning to non-fiction, and has since written several critically acclaimed and best-selling historical works.\n\n==Career and works==\nKing was born in [[Estevan]], Saskatchewan, Canada and was raised in the nearby village of [[North Portal]].  He received his undergraduate university education at the [[University of Regina]], where in 1984 he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in English Literature.  Continuing his studies at the University of Regina, he received a Master of Arts degree in 1986 upon completing a thesis on the poet [[T. S. Eliot]].  Later he achieved a PhD from [[York University]] in Toronto (1992), where he specialized in eighteenth-century English literature.\n\nKing moved to England to take up a position as a post-doctoral research fellow at [[University College London]].  It was at this time that he began writing his first novel.\n\nKing's first novel, ''Domino'', (1995), tells the story of a castrato singer seen through the experience of an aspiring painter in the London of the 1770s.\n\nIn 1998, King published ''Ex-Libris'', his second work of historical fiction.  Set in London and Prague, it chronicles how a London bookseller's search in the 1660s for a missing manuscript leads him unwittingly into a world of deception and murder.\n\n''Brunelleschi's Dome: The Story of the Great Cathedral in Florence'' (2000) describes how the Italian architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] designed what still stands as the largest masonry dome ever built: the dome of the cathedral of [[Santa Maria del Fiore]], completed in 1436.  ''Brunelleschi's Dome'' marked King's transition from novelist to writer of art histories and biographies.<ref name=Globe>{{cite news|last=Barber|first=John|title=Writer Ross King : 'I\u2019m not interested in making things up'|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/writer-ross-king-im-not-interested-in-making-things-up/article5368277/|accessdate=January 30, 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=November 16, 2012}}</ref>  ''Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling,'' (2002), follows the four arduous years during which [[Michelangelo]] painted the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]] amid the political and religious intrigues of early sixteenth-century Rome.\n\nKing's next book, ''The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade That Gave the World Impressionism'' (2006), was met by much critical acclaim and considerable commercial success.  By contrasting the works and lives of the French painters [[Ernest Meissonier]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]], the book chronicles the dramatic transition by which the [[Impressionism|Impressionist painters]] changed the artistic vision of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century.

However, it is likely that the exact nature and roles of digital journalism will not be fully known for some time.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe first type of digital journalism, called [[teletext]], was invented in the UK in 1970. Teletext is a system allowing viewers to choose which stories they wish to read and see it immediately. The information provided through teletext is brief and instant, similar to the information seen in digital journalism today.  {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The information was broadcast between the frames of a television signal in what was called the Vertical Blanking Interval or VBI.\n\nAmerican journalist, Hunter S. Thompson relied on early digital communication technology beginning by using a fax machine to report from the 1971 US presidential campaign trail as documented in his book [[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail]].\n\nAfter the invention of teletext was the invention of [[videotex]], of which [[Prestel]] was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979<ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 36.</ref> with various British newspapers such as the [[Financial Times]] lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. Videotex closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end-user demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Third Wave of Online Journalism|url= http://www.ojr.org/ojr/future/1019174689.php|publisher=ojr.org}}</ref>\n\nAmerican newspaper companies took notice of the new technology and created their own videotex systems, the largest and most ambitious being Viewtron, a service of Knight-Ridder launched in 1981. Others were Keycom in Chicago and Gateway in Los Angeles. All of them had closed by 1986.\n\nNext came computer Bulletin Board Systems. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several smaller newspapers started online news services using BBS software and telephone modems. The first of these was the Albuquerque Tribune in 1989.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in September 1992 [[breaking news|broke the news]] of [[Electronic Arts]]' acquisition of [[Origin Systems]] on [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], before its next issue went to press.<ref name=\"wilson199212\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=101 | title=Anatomy of a Rumor | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1992<!-- -12 --> | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=210}}</ref> Online news websites began to proliferate in the 1990s.  An early adopter was ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] which offered online news as [[Nando]]. Steve Yelvington wrote on the [[Poynter Institute]] website about [[Nando]], owned by The N&O, by saying \"Nando evolved into the first serious, professional [[news site]] on the World Wide Web\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It originated in the early 1990s as \"NandO Land\".  It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, [[Netscape Navigator]] (1994), and [[Internet Explorer]] (1995).<ref name=\"auto4\">Scott 2005, p. 94.</ref> By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty-four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their [[news aggregator]]s (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAlso, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', was founded in 1995.

People can comment on articles and start discussion boards to discuss articles. Before the Internet, spontaneous discussion between readers who had never met was impossible. The process of discussing a news item is a big portion of what makes for digital journalism.  People add to the story and connect with other people who want to discuss the topic.\n\nDigital journalism creates an opportunity for [[niche audience]]s, allowing people to have more options as to what to view and read.\n\nDigital journalism opens up new ways of storytelling; through the technical components of the new medium, digital journalists can provide a variety of media, such as [[sound|audio]], [[video]], and [[digital photography]].\n\nDigital journalism represents a revolution of how news is consumed by society. Online sources are able to provide quick, efficient, and accurate [[Reporter|reporting]] of breaking news in a matter of seconds, providing society with a synopsis of events as they occur. Throughout the development of the event, journalists are able to feed online sources the information keeping readers up-to-date in mere seconds. The speed in which a story can be posted can affect the accuracy of the reporting in a way that doesn't usually happen in print journalism. Before the emergence of digital journalism the printing process took much more time, allowing for the discovery and correction of errors.\n\nNews consumers must become Web literate and use [[critical thinking]] to evaluate the credibility of sources.  Because it is possible for anyone to write articles and post them on the Internet, the definition of journalism is changing. Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable [[Online newspaper|news websites]], it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the [[Information overload|massive amount of information]] coming in from the digital area of journalism.\n\nThere are great advantages with digital journalism and the new [[blogging]] evolution that people are becoming accustomed to, but there are disadvantages. For instance, people are used to what they already know and can't always catch up quickly with the new technologies in the 21st century. The goals of print and digital journalism are the same, although different tools are needed to function.\n\nThe interaction between the writer and consumer is new, and this can be credited to digital journalism. There are many ways to get personal thoughts on the Web. There are some disadvantages to this, however, the main one being [[Formal verification|factual information]]. There is a pressing need for accuracy in digital journalism, and until they find a way to press accuracy, they will still face some criticism.\n\nOne major dispute regards the credibility of these online news websites. A digital journalism credibility study performed by the [[Online News Association]] compares the online public credibility ratings to actual media respondent credibility ratings. Looking at a variety of online media sources, the study found that overall the public saw online media as more credible than it actually is.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105151127/http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |archive-date=2006-11-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe effects of digital journalism are evident worldwide. This form of journalism has pushed journalists to reform and evolve. Older journalists who are not tech savvy have felt the blunt force of this. In recent months, a number of older journalists have been pushed out and younger journalists brought in because of their lower cost and ability to work in advanced technology settings.\n\n==Impact on publishers==\nMany newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', have created [[Online newspaper|online sites]] to remain competitive and have taken advantage of audio, video, and text linking to remain at the top of news consumers' lists as most of the news enthusiasm now reach their base through hand held devices such as smartphones, tablets etc. Hence audio or video backing is a definite advantage.\n\nNewspapers rarely break news stories any more, with most websites reporting on breaking news before the cable news channels.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Digital journalism allows for reports to start out vague and generalized, and progress to a better story. Newspapers and TV cable are at a disadvantage because they generally can only put together stories when an ample amount of detail and information are available.  Often, newspapers have to wait for the next day, or even two days later if it is a late-breaking story, before being able to publish it. Newspapers lose a lot of ground to their online counterparts, with [[advertising|ad revenue]] shifting to the Internet, and subscription to the printed paper decreasing. People are now able to find the news they want, when they want, without having to leave their homes or pay to receive the news {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, even though there are still people who are willing to pay for online journalistic content.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Himma-Kadakas |first1=Marju |last2=K\u00f5uts |first2=Ragne |title=Who Is Willing to Pay for Online Journalistic Content? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=106 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.345 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/345|year=2015 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nBecause of this, many people have viewed digital journalism as the death of journalism.{{who|date=February 2011}} According to communication scholar Nicole Cohen, \"four practices stand out as putting pressure on traditional journalism production: outsourcing, unpaid labour, metrics and measurement, and automation\".<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nicole S.|date=2015-04-03|title=From Pink Slips to Pink Slime: Transforming Media Labor in a Digital Age|journal=The Communication Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=98\u2013122|doi=10.1080/10714421.2015.1031996|issn=1071-4421}}</ref> Free advertising on websites such as [[Craigslist]] has transformed how people publicize; the Internet has created a faster, cheaper way for people to get news out, thus creating the shift in ad sales from standard newspapers to the Internet.

The growth in digital journalism and the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|near collapse of the economy]] has also led to [[Layoff|downsizing]] for those in the industry.\n\nStudents wishing to become journalists now need to be familiar with digital journalism in order to be able to contribute and develop journalism skills. Not only must a journalist analyze their audience and focus on effective communication with them, they have to be quick; news websites are able to update their stories within minutes of the news event. Other skills may include creating a website and uploading information using basic programming skills.\n\nCritics believe digital journalism has made it easier for individuals who are not qualified journalists to misinform<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ekstr\u00f6m|first=Mats|last2=Lewis|first2=Seth C.|last3=Westlund|first3=Oscar|date=2020-01-20|title=Epistemologies of digital journalism and the study of misinformation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819856914|journal=New Media & Society|language=en-US|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205\u2013212|doi=10.1177/1461444819856914|issn=1461-4448}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ciampaglia|first=Giovanni Luca|last2=Mantzarlis|first2=Alexios|last3=Maus|first3=Gregory|last4=Menczer|first4=Filippo|date=2018-03-27|title=Research Challenges of Digital Misinformation: Toward a Trustworthy Web|url=https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2783|journal=AI Magazine|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=65\u201374|doi=10.1609/aimag.v39i1.2783|issn=2371-9621}}</ref> the general public. Many believe that this form of journalism has created a number of sites that do not have credible information. Sites such as [[Perez Hilton|PerezHilton.com]] have been criticized for blurring the lines between journalism and opinionated writing.\n\nSome critics believe that newspapers should not switch to a solely Internet-based format, but instead keep a component of print as well as digital.\n\nDigital journalism allows citizens and readers the opportunity to join in on [[threaded discussion]]s relating to a news article that has been read by the public. This offers an excellent source for writers and reporters to decide what is important and what should be omitted in the future. These threads can provide useful information to writers of digital journalism so that future articles can be pruned and improved to possibly create a better article the next time around.\n\n== Implications on traditional Journalism ==\n[[Digitizing|Digitization]] is currently causing many changes to traditional journalistic practices. The labor of journalists, in general, is becoming increasingly dependent on digital journalism. Scholars outline that this is a change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the [[Labor process theory|labor process]].<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\">{{Cite journal|last=\u00d6rnebring|first=Henrik|date=2010-02-03|title=Technology and journalism-as-labour: Historical perspectives|journal=Journalism|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=57\u201374|doi=10.1177/1464884909350644}}</ref> They also contend that this is simply the de-skilling of some skills and the up-skilling of others.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> This theory is in contention to the notion that [[technological determinism]] is negatively effecting [[journalism]], as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being [[outsourcing]], [[algorithm]]s, and [[automation]].<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/> Although Cohen believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way.<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/>\n\nThere is also the impact that digital journalism is influencing the uprising of citizen journalism. Because digital journalism takes place online and is contributed mostly by citizens on user-generated content sites, there is competition growing between the two. Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to verify the source of information.\n\n==Work outside traditional press==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet has also given rise to more participation by people who are not normally journalists, such as with Indy Media (Max Perez).\n\n[[Bloggers]] write on [[web logs]] or [[blogs]]. Traditional journalists often do not consider bloggers to automatically be journalists. This has more to do with standards and professional practices than the medium. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding journalism attracts amateur journalists, as well as ambitious professionals that are restrained by the boundaries set by traditional press. However, the implication of these types of journalism is that it disregards the professional norms of journalistic practices that ensures accuracy and impartiality of the content.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Andrea|date=2014-11-24|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272\u2013288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915}}</ref>  But, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, blogging has generally gained at least more attention and has led to some effects on mainstream journalism, such as exposing problems related to a television piece about President [[George W. Bush]]'s National Guard Service.\n\nRecent legal judgements have determined that bloggers are entitled to the same protections as other journalists subject to the same responsibilities. In the United States, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ has been instrumental] in advocating for the [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ rights of journalist bloggers].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=6&doc_id=285455&doc_no=H028579|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|publisher=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that:\"[96] A second preliminary question is what the new defence should be called. In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test. This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style. However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists. These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets. I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is \"available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium\": Jameel, at para. 54.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7837/index.do|title=Grant v. Torstar Corp. - SCC Cases (Lexum)|author=|date=|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}</ref>\n\nOther significant tools of on-line journalism are Internet [[Internet forum|forums]], [[discussion boards]] and [[online chat|chat]]s, especially those representing the Internet version of official media. The widespread use of the Internet all over the world created a unique opportunity to create a meeting place for both sides in many conflicts, such as the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s. Often this gives a unique chance to find new, alternative solutions to the conflict, but often the Internet is turned into the battlefield by contradicting parties creating endless \"online battles.\"\n\n[[Internet radio]] and [[podcast]]s are other growing independent media based on the Internet.\n\n==Blogs==\nWith the rise of digital media, there is a move from the traditional journalist to the blogger or amateur journalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com/local--files/lydiamiljan/lydia+miljan.pdf|title=The file does not exist|author=|date=|website=theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com}}</ref> Blogs can be seen as a new genre of journalism because of their \"narrative style of news characterized by personalization\" that moves away from traditional journalism's approach,<ref>Wall 2005, p. 154.</ref> changing journalism into a more conversational and decentralized type of news.<ref name=\"auto10\">Wall 2005, p. 157.</ref> Blogging has become a large part of the transmitting of news and ideas across cites, states, and countries, and bloggers argue that blogs themselves are now breaking stories.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> Even online news publications have blogs that are written by their affiliated journalists or other respected writers.  Blogging allows readers and journalists to be opinionated about the news and talk about it in an open environment.  Blogs allow comments where some news outlets do not, due to the need to [[Moderation system|constantly monitor]] what is posted.  By allowing comments, the reader can interact with a story instead of just absorbing the words on the screen. According to one 2007 study, 15% of those who read blogs read them for news.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synovate survey: New study shows Americans' blogging behaviour |url=http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |publisher=synovate.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015005/http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |archivedate=2011-08-15 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, many blogs are highly opinionated and have a [[bias]]. Some are not verified to be true. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) established guidelines mandating that bloggers disclose any free goods or services they receive from third parties in 2009 in response to a question of the integrity of product and service reviews in the online community.<ref>http://ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm|title=FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials|work=ftc.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe development of blogging communities has partly resulted because of the lack of local news coverage, the spread of misinformation, and the manipulation of news. Blogging platforms are often used as mediums to spread ideas and connect to others with similar mentalities. Anonymity lives within these platforms that circulates different perspectives. Some have postulated that blogs\u2019 usage of public opinions as facts has gained them status and creditability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molek-Kozakowska|first=Katarzyna|date=August 2013|title=Book review: Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1750481313485398c|journal=Discourse & Communication|language=en-US|volume=7|issue=3|pages=365\u2013367|doi=10.1177/1750481313485398c|issn=1750-4813}}</ref> Memes are often shared on these blogs due to its social phenomenon and its relation to existing subcultures which often attain high engagement. Traditional journalism has helped set the foundation for blogs, which are frequently used to question mainstream media reported by journalist.\n\n==Citizen journalism==\nDigital journalism's lack of a traditional \"editor\" has given rise to [[citizen journalism]]. The early advances that the digital age offered journalism were faster research, easier editing, conveniences, and a faster delivery time for articles. The Internet has broadened the effect that the digital age has on journalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio|date=2019-03-16|title=The 5Ws and 1H of Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=7|issue=3|pages=351\u2013358|doi=10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|issn=2167-0811}}</ref> Because of the popularity of the Internet, most people have access and can add their forms of journalism to the information network. This allows anyone who wants to share something they deem important that has happened in their community. Individuals who are not professional journalists who present news through their blogs or websites are often referred to as citizen journalists. One does not need a <!-- college? -->[[Academic degree|degree]] to be a citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed. Some companies use the information that a citizen journalist relays when they themselves can not access certain situations, for example, in countries where [[freedom of the press]] is limited. Anyone can [[Internet video|record]] events happening and send it anywhere they wish, or put it on their website. Non-profit and grassroots digital journalism sites may have far fewer resources than their corporate counterparts, yet due to digital media are able to have websites that are technically comparable.<ref>Kawamoto 2003, p. 15.</ref> Other media outlets can then pick up their story and run with it as they please, thus allowing information to reach wider audiences.\n\nFor citizen journalism to be effective and successful, there needs to be citizen editors. Their role being to solicit other people to provide accurate information and to mediate interactivity among users. An example can be found in the start-up of the South Korean online daily newspaper, [[OhMyNews]], where the founder recruited several hundred volunteer \"citizen reporters\" to write news articles that were edited and processed by four professional journalists.<ref>Bentley 2011, p. 107.</ref>\n\n==News collections==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet also offers options such as personalized news feeds and [[News aggregator|aggregators]], which compile news from different websites into one site. One of the most popular news aggregators is [[Google News]]. Others include  [[Topix.net]], and [[TheFreeLibrary.com]].\n\nBut, some people see too much personalization as detrimental. For example, some fear that people will have narrower exposure to news, seeking out only those commentators who already agree with them.\n\nAs of March 2005, [[Wikinews]] rewrites articles from other news organizations. Original reporting remains a challenge on the Internet as the burdens of verification and legal risks (especially from plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions like BC) remain high in the absence of any net-wide approach to defamation.<ref>O'Grady v.

However, it is likely that the exact nature and roles of digital journalism will not be fully known for some time.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe first type of digital journalism, called [[teletext]], was invented in the UK in 1970. Teletext is a system allowing viewers to choose which stories they wish to read and see it immediately. The information provided through teletext is brief and instant, similar to the information seen in digital journalism today.  {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The information was broadcast between the frames of a television signal in what was called the Vertical Blanking Interval or VBI.\n\nAmerican journalist, Hunter S. Thompson relied on early digital communication technology beginning by using a fax machine to report from the 1971 US presidential campaign trail as documented in his book [[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail]].\n\nAfter the invention of teletext was the invention of [[videotex]], of which [[Prestel]] was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979<ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 36.</ref> with various British newspapers such as the [[Financial Times]] lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. Videotex closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end-user demand.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Third Wave of Online Journalism|url= http://www.ojr.org/ojr/future/1019174689.php|publisher=ojr.org}}</ref>\n\nAmerican newspaper companies took notice of the new technology and created their own videotex systems, the largest and most ambitious being Viewtron, a service of Knight-Ridder launched in 1981. Others were Keycom in Chicago and Gateway in Los Angeles. All of them had closed by 1986.\n\nNext came computer Bulletin Board Systems. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several smaller newspapers started online news services using BBS software and telephone modems. The first of these was the Albuquerque Tribune in 1989.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in September 1992 [[breaking news|broke the news]] of [[Electronic Arts]]' acquisition of [[Origin Systems]] on [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], before its next issue went to press.<ref name=\"wilson199212\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=101 | title=Anatomy of a Rumor | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1992<!-- -12 --> | accessdate=5 July 2014 | author=Wilson, Johnny L. | pages=210}}</ref> Online news websites began to proliferate in the 1990s.  An early adopter was ''[[The News & Observer]]'' in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] which offered online news as [[Nando]]. Steve Yelvington wrote on the [[Poynter Institute]] website about [[Nando]], owned by The N&O, by saying \"Nando evolved into the first serious, professional [[news site]] on the World Wide Web\".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It originated in the early 1990s as \"NandO Land\".  It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, [[Netscape Navigator]] (1994), and [[Internet Explorer]] (1995).<ref name=\"auto4\">Scott 2005, p. 94.</ref> By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty-four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their [[news aggregator]]s (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAlso, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', was founded in 1995. In 2001 the ''[[American Journalism Review]]'' called ''Salon'' the Internet's \"preeminent independent venue for journalism.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=314 |title=Can Salon Make It? |first= Paul |last=Fahri |magazine=American Journalism Review|volume= March 2001 |accessdate= July 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, for the first time, more Americans reported getting their national and international news from the internet, rather than newspapers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tossed By A Gale|work=The Economist|date=May 14, 2009|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13642689}}{{Subscription}}</ref> Young people aged 18 to 29 now primarily get their news via the Internet, according to a Pew Research Center report.<ref name=\"auto6\">{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Meghan|title=Internet Surpasses Television as Main News Source for Young Adults [STUDY].|url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/04/internet-surpasses-television-as-main-news-source-for-young-adults-study/|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref> Audiences to news sites continued to grow due to the launch of new news sites, continued investment in news online by conventional news organizations, and the continued growth in internet audiences overall.<ref name=\"Pew09-5\">{{cite web |title=The State of the Online News Media 2009 |work=Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. |url=http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_online_intro.php?media=5 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316185250/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2009/narrative_online_intro.php?media=5 |archivedate=2010-03-16 }}</ref> Sixty-five percent of youth now primarily access the news online.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nMainstream news sites are the most widespread form of online newsmedia production.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> As of 2000, the vast majority of journalists in the Western world now use the internet regularly in their daily work.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> In addition to mainstream news sites, digital journalism is found in index and category sites (sites without much original content but many links to existing news sites), meta- and comment sites (sites about newsmedia issues like media watchdogs), and [[Virtual community|share and discussion sites]] (sites that facilitate the connection of people, like [[Slashdot]]).<ref>Deuze 2003, p. 208-211.</ref><ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 15.</ref> Blogs are also another digital journalism phenomenon capable of fresh information, ranging from personal sites to those with audiences of hundreds of thousands.<ref>Kawamoto 2005, p. 16.</ref> Digital journalism is involved in the cloud journalism<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Fondevila |last1=Gasc\u00f3n|first2= Joan |last2=Francesc |year=2010 |title=El cloud journalism: un nuevo concepto de producci\u00f3n para el periodismo del siglo XXI |journal= Observatorio (OBS*) |volume= 4, N\u00fam. 1 (2010) |pages= 19\u201335 |issn= 1646-5954 |url=http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/view/315/321}}</ref> phenomenon, a constant flow of contents in the Broadband Society.<ref>Fondevila Gasc\u00f3n, Joan Francesc (2009). \"El papel decisivo de la banda ancha en el Espacio Iberoamericano del Conocimiento\".

Some news organizations use the Web exclusively or as a secondary outlet for their content. The [[Online News Association]], founded in 1999, is the largest organization representing online journalists, with more than 1,700 members whose principal livelihood involves gathering or producing news for digital presentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalists.org/?page=onamission|title=Online News Association|author=Online News Association|work=journalists.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. Newspapers may lose [[classified advertising]] to websites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography. These organizations are concerned about real and perceived loss of viewers and circulation to the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pew Research Journalism Project|url=http://www.journalism.org/2014/03/26/state-of-the-news-media-2014-key-indicators-in-media-and-news/|website=Journalism.org|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nHyperlocal journalism is journalism within a very small community.

People can comment on articles and start discussion boards to discuss articles. Before the Internet, spontaneous discussion between readers who had never met was impossible. The process of discussing a news item is a big portion of what makes for digital journalism.  People add to the story and connect with other people who want to discuss the topic.\n\nDigital journalism creates an opportunity for [[niche audience]]s, allowing people to have more options as to what to view and read.\n\nDigital journalism opens up new ways of storytelling; through the technical components of the new medium, digital journalists can provide a variety of media, such as [[sound|audio]], [[video]], and [[digital photography]].\n\nDigital journalism represents a revolution of how news is consumed by society. Online sources are able to provide quick, efficient, and accurate [[Reporter|reporting]] of breaking news in a matter of seconds, providing society with a synopsis of events as they occur. Throughout the development of the event, journalists are able to feed online sources the information keeping readers up-to-date in mere seconds. The speed in which a story can be posted can affect the accuracy of the reporting in a way that doesn't usually happen in print journalism. Before the emergence of digital journalism the printing process took much more time, allowing for the discovery and correction of errors.\n\nNews consumers must become Web literate and use [[critical thinking]] to evaluate the credibility of sources.  Because it is possible for anyone to write articles and post them on the Internet, the definition of journalism is changing. Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable [[Online newspaper|news websites]], it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the [[Information overload|massive amount of information]] coming in from the digital area of journalism.\n\nThere are great advantages with digital journalism and the new [[blogging]] evolution that people are becoming accustomed to, but there are disadvantages. For instance, people are used to what they already know and can't always catch up quickly with the new technologies in the 21st century. The goals of print and digital journalism are the same, although different tools are needed to function.\n\nThe interaction between the writer and consumer is new, and this can be credited to digital journalism. There are many ways to get personal thoughts on the Web. There are some disadvantages to this, however, the main one being [[Formal verification|factual information]]. There is a pressing need for accuracy in digital journalism, and until they find a way to press accuracy, they will still face some criticism.\n\nOne major dispute regards the credibility of these online news websites. A digital journalism credibility study performed by the [[Online News Association]] compares the online public credibility ratings to actual media respondent credibility ratings. Looking at a variety of online media sources, the study found that overall the public saw online media as more credible than it actually is.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105151127/http://www.mjbear.com/presentations/AUSTIN.ppt |archive-date=2006-11-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe effects of digital journalism are evident worldwide. This form of journalism has pushed journalists to reform and evolve. Older journalists who are not tech savvy have felt the blunt force of this. In recent months, a number of older journalists have been pushed out and younger journalists brought in because of their lower cost and ability to work in advanced technology settings.\n\n==Impact on publishers==\nMany newspapers, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', have created [[Online newspaper|online sites]] to remain competitive and have taken advantage of audio, video, and text linking to remain at the top of news consumers' lists as most of the news enthusiasm now reach their base through hand held devices such as smartphones, tablets etc. Hence audio or video backing is a definite advantage.\n\nNewspapers rarely break news stories any more, with most websites reporting on breaking news before the cable news channels.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Digital journalism allows for reports to start out vague and generalized, and progress to a better story. Newspapers and TV cable are at a disadvantage because they generally can only put together stories when an ample amount of detail and information are available.  Often, newspapers have to wait for the next day, or even two days later if it is a late-breaking story, before being able to publish it. Newspapers lose a lot of ground to their online counterparts, with [[advertising|ad revenue]] shifting to the Internet, and subscription to the printed paper decreasing. People are now able to find the news they want, when they want, without having to leave their homes or pay to receive the news {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}, even though there are still people who are willing to pay for online journalistic content.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Himma-Kadakas |first1=Marju |last2=K\u00f5uts |first2=Ragne |title=Who Is Willing to Pay for Online Journalistic Content? |journal=Media and Communication |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=106 |doi=10.17645/mac.v3i4.345 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/345|year=2015 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nBecause of this, many people have viewed digital journalism as the death of journalism.{{who|date=February 2011}} According to communication scholar Nicole Cohen, \"four practices stand out as putting pressure on traditional journalism production: outsourcing, unpaid labour, metrics and measurement, and automation\".<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\">{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Nicole S.|date=2015-04-03|title=From Pink Slips to Pink Slime: Transforming Media Labor in a Digital Age|journal=The Communication Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=98\u2013122|doi=10.1080/10714421.2015.1031996|issn=1071-4421}}</ref> Free advertising on websites such as [[Craigslist]] has transformed how people publicize; the Internet has created a faster, cheaper way for people to get news out, thus creating the shift in ad sales from standard newspapers to the Internet.

The growth in digital journalism and the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|near collapse of the economy]] has also led to [[Layoff|downsizing]] for those in the industry.\n\nStudents wishing to become journalists now need to be familiar with digital journalism in order to be able to contribute and develop journalism skills. Not only must a journalist analyze their audience and focus on effective communication with them, they have to be quick; news websites are able to update their stories within minutes of the news event. Other skills may include creating a website and uploading information using basic programming skills.\n\nCritics believe digital journalism has made it easier for individuals who are not qualified journalists to misinform<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ekstr\u00f6m|first=Mats|last2=Lewis|first2=Seth C.|last3=Westlund|first3=Oscar|date=2020-01-20|title=Epistemologies of digital journalism and the study of misinformation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444819856914|journal=New Media & Society|language=en-US|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205\u2013212|doi=10.1177/1461444819856914|issn=1461-4448}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ciampaglia|first=Giovanni Luca|last2=Mantzarlis|first2=Alexios|last3=Maus|first3=Gregory|last4=Menczer|first4=Filippo|date=2018-03-27|title=Research Challenges of Digital Misinformation: Toward a Trustworthy Web|url=https://aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2783|journal=AI Magazine|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=65\u201374|doi=10.1609/aimag.v39i1.2783|issn=2371-9621}}</ref> the general public. Many believe that this form of journalism has created a number of sites that do not have credible information. Sites such as [[Perez Hilton|PerezHilton.com]] have been criticized for blurring the lines between journalism and opinionated writing.\n\nSome critics believe that newspapers should not switch to a solely Internet-based format, but instead keep a component of print as well as digital.\n\nDigital journalism allows citizens and readers the opportunity to join in on [[threaded discussion]]s relating to a news article that has been read by the public. This offers an excellent source for writers and reporters to decide what is important and what should be omitted in the future. These threads can provide useful information to writers of digital journalism so that future articles can be pruned and improved to possibly create a better article the next time around.\n\n== Implications on traditional Journalism ==\n[[Digitizing|Digitization]] is currently causing many changes to traditional journalistic practices. The labor of journalists, in general, is becoming increasingly dependent on digital journalism. Scholars outline that this is a change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the [[Labor process theory|labor process]].<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\">{{Cite journal|last=\u00d6rnebring|first=Henrik|date=2010-02-03|title=Technology and journalism-as-labour: Historical perspectives|journal=Journalism|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=57\u201374|doi=10.1177/1464884909350644}}</ref> They also contend that this is simply the de-skilling of some skills and the up-skilling of others.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> This theory is in contention to the notion that [[technological determinism]] is negatively effecting [[journalism]], as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set.<ref name=\"\u00d6rnebring 57\u201374\"/> Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being [[outsourcing]], [[algorithm]]s, and [[automation]].<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/> Although Cohen believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way.<ref name=\"Cohen 98\u2013122\"/>\n\nThere is also the impact that digital journalism is influencing the uprising of citizen journalism. Because digital journalism takes place online and is contributed mostly by citizens on user-generated content sites, there is competition growing between the two. Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to verify the source of information.\n\n==Work outside traditional press==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet has also given rise to more participation by people who are not normally journalists, such as with Indy Media (Max Perez).\n\n[[Bloggers]] write on [[web logs]] or [[blogs]]. Traditional journalists often do not consider bloggers to automatically be journalists. This has more to do with standards and professional practices than the medium. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding journalism attracts amateur journalists, as well as ambitious professionals that are restrained by the boundaries set by traditional press. However, the implication of these types of journalism is that it disregards the professional norms of journalistic practices that ensures accuracy and impartiality of the content.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Andrea|date=2014-11-24|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272\u2013288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915}}</ref>  But, {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, blogging has generally gained at least more attention and has led to some effects on mainstream journalism, such as exposing problems related to a television piece about President [[George W. Bush]]'s National Guard Service.\n\nRecent legal judgements have determined that bloggers are entitled to the same protections as other journalists subject to the same responsibilities. In the United States, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ has been instrumental] in advocating for the [https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does/ rights of journalist bloggers].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/dockets.cfm?dist=6&doc_id=285455&doc_no=H028579|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|publisher=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that:\"[96] A second preliminary question is what the new defence should be called. In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test. This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style. However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists. These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets. I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is \"available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium\": Jameel, at para. 54.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7837/index.do|title=Grant v. Torstar Corp. - SCC Cases (Lexum)|author=|date=|website=scc-csc.lexum.com}}</ref>\n\nOther significant tools of on-line journalism are Internet [[Internet forum|forums]], [[discussion boards]] and [[online chat|chat]]s, especially those representing the Internet version of official media. The widespread use of the Internet all over the world created a unique opportunity to create a meeting place for both sides in many conflicts, such as the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s. Often this gives a unique chance to find new, alternative solutions to the conflict, but often the Internet is turned into the battlefield by contradicting parties creating endless \"online battles.\"\n\n[[Internet radio]] and [[podcast]]s are other growing independent media based on the Internet.\n\n==Blogs==\nWith the rise of digital media, there is a move from the traditional journalist to the blogger or amateur journalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com/local--files/lydiamiljan/lydia+miljan.pdf|title=The file does not exist|author=|date=|website=theendofjournalism.wdfiles.com}}</ref> Blogs can be seen as a new genre of journalism because of their \"narrative style of news characterized by personalization\" that moves away from traditional journalism's approach,<ref>Wall 2005, p. 154.</ref> changing journalism into a more conversational and decentralized type of news.<ref name=\"auto10\">Wall 2005, p. 157.</ref> Blogging has become a large part of the transmitting of news and ideas across cites, states, and countries, and bloggers argue that blogs themselves are now breaking stories.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> Even online news publications have blogs that are written by their affiliated journalists or other respected writers.  Blogging allows readers and journalists to be opinionated about the news and talk about it in an open environment.  Blogs allow comments where some news outlets do not, due to the need to [[Moderation system|constantly monitor]] what is posted.  By allowing comments, the reader can interact with a story instead of just absorbing the words on the screen. According to one 2007 study, 15% of those who read blogs read them for news.<ref>{{cite web|title=Synovate survey: New study shows Americans' blogging behaviour |url=http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |publisher=synovate.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015005/http://www.synovate.com/news/article/2007/08/new-study-shows-americans-blogging-behaviour.html |archivedate=2011-08-15 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, many blogs are highly opinionated and have a [[bias]]. Some are not verified to be true. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) established guidelines mandating that bloggers disclose any free goods or services they receive from third parties in 2009 in response to a question of the integrity of product and service reviews in the online community.<ref>http://ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm|title=FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials|work=ftc.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe development of blogging communities has partly resulted because of the lack of local news coverage, the spread of misinformation, and the manipulation of news. Blogging platforms are often used as mediums to spread ideas and connect to others with similar mentalities. Anonymity lives within these platforms that circulates different perspectives. Some have postulated that blogs\u2019 usage of public opinions as facts has gained them status and creditability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molek-Kozakowska|first=Katarzyna|date=August 2013|title=Book review: Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1750481313485398c|journal=Discourse & Communication|language=en-US|volume=7|issue=3|pages=365\u2013367|doi=10.1177/1750481313485398c|issn=1750-4813}}</ref> Memes are often shared on these blogs due to its social phenomenon and its relation to existing subcultures which often attain high engagement. Traditional journalism has helped set the foundation for blogs, which are frequently used to question mainstream media reported by journalist.\n\n==Citizen journalism==\nDigital journalism's lack of a traditional \"editor\" has given rise to [[citizen journalism]]. The early advances that the digital age offered journalism were faster research, easier editing, conveniences, and a faster delivery time for articles. The Internet has broadened the effect that the digital age has on journalism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio|date=2019-03-16|title=The 5Ws and 1H of Digital Journalism|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=7|issue=3|pages=351\u2013358|doi=10.1080/21670811.2018.1545592|issn=2167-0811}}</ref> Because of the popularity of the Internet, most people have access and can add their forms of journalism to the information network. This allows anyone who wants to share something they deem important that has happened in their community. Individuals who are not professional journalists who present news through their blogs or websites are often referred to as citizen journalists. One does not need a <!-- college? -->[[Academic degree|degree]] to be a citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed. Some companies use the information that a citizen journalist relays when they themselves can not access certain situations, for example, in countries where [[freedom of the press]] is limited. Anyone can [[Internet video|record]] events happening and send it anywhere they wish, or put it on their website. Non-profit and grassroots digital journalism sites may have far fewer resources than their corporate counterparts, yet due to digital media are able to have websites that are technically comparable.<ref>Kawamoto 2003, p. 15.</ref> Other media outlets can then pick up their story and run with it as they please, thus allowing information to reach wider audiences.\n\nFor citizen journalism to be effective and successful, there needs to be citizen editors. Their role being to solicit other people to provide accurate information and to mediate interactivity among users. An example can be found in the start-up of the South Korean online daily newspaper, [[OhMyNews]], where the founder recruited several hundred volunteer \"citizen reporters\" to write news articles that were edited and processed by four professional journalists.<ref>Bentley 2011, p. 107.</ref>\n\n==News collections==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Internet also offers options such as personalized news feeds and [[News aggregator|aggregators]], which compile news from different websites into one site. One of the most popular news aggregators is [[Google News]]. Others include  [[Topix.net]], and [[TheFreeLibrary.com]].\n\nBut, some people see too much personalization as detrimental. For example, some fear that people will have narrower exposure to news, seeking out only those commentators who already agree with them.\n\nAs of March 2005, [[Wikinews]] rewrites articles from other news organizations. Original reporting remains a challenge on the Internet as the burdens of verification and legal risks (especially from plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions like BC) remain high in the absence of any net-wide approach to defamation.<ref>O'Grady v.

Examples of circumflex use in Afrikaans are ''s\u00ea'' \"to say\", ''w\u00eareld'' \"world\", ''m\u00f4re'' \"tomorrow\", ''br\u00fbe'' \"bridges\".\n* [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. In the transliteration of this language, the circumflex indicates a long vowel resulting from an [[aleph]] contraction.\n* In western [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Sauk language (Algonquian)|Sauk]], and [[Saulteaux language|Saulteaux]], the Algonquianist Standard Roman Orthography (SRO) indicates long vowels {{IPA|[a\u02d0 e\u02d0 i\u02d0 o\u02d0~u\u02d0]}} either with a circumflex \u27e8''\u00e2 \u00ea \u00ee \u00f4''\u27e9 or with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] \u27e8''\u0101 \u0113 \u012b \u014d''\u27e9.\n* The PDA orthography for [[Domari language|Domari]] uses circumflex-bearing vowels for length.\n* In [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], ''\u00e2 \u00ee \u00fb'' are used to represent {{IPA|[a\u02d0, i\u02d0, u\u02d0]}}\n\n* [[French language|French]]. In some varieties, such as in [[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]] and [[Acadian French]], vowels with a circumflex are long: ''f\u00eate'' {{IPA|[f\u025b\u02d0t]}} (party) is longer than ''faite'' {{IPA|[f\u025bt]}}. This [[compensatory lengthening|length compensates]] for a deleted consonant, usually ''s''.\n* [[Friulian language|Standard Friulian]].\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. In the [[Nihon-shiki]] system of [[Romaji|romanization]], the circumflex is used to indicate long vowels. The [[Kunrei-shiki]] system, which is based on Nihon-shiki system, also uses the circumflex. The Traditional and Modified forms of the [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]] system use the [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] for this purpose, though some users may use the circumflex as a substitute if there are difficulties inputting the macron, as the two diacritics are visually similar.\n* [[J\u00e8rriais]].\n* In [[Kurmanji|Kurmanji Kurdish]], \u27e8\u00ea \u00ee \u00fb\u27e9 are used to represent {{IPA|/e\u02d0 i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}}. <ref>{{cite web|page=11|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Kurmanji/kurmanji_1_grammar.pdf|title=Kurmanji Kurdish: A Reference Grammar with Selected Readings|last=Thackston|first=Wheeler M.|date =  2006| website =Iranian Studies at Harvard University  | publisher = [[Harvard University]]| access-date = November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian language]].\n* In [[Luxembourgish]] ''m\u0302 n\u0302'' can be used to indicate nasalisation of a vowel. Also, the circumflex can be over the vowel to indicate nasalisation. In either case, the circumflex is rare.\n* [[Old Malay]]\n* In [[Serbo-Croatian]] the circumflex can be used to distinguish [[homograph]]s, and it is called the \"genitive sign\" or \"length sign\". Examples include ''sam'' \"am\" versus ''s\u00e2m'' \"alone\". For example, the phrase \"I am alone\" may be written ''Ja sam s\u00e2m'' to improve clarity. Another example: ''da'' \"yes\", ''d\u00e2'' \"gives\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.srpskijezickiatelje.com/pravopis:ostali-znaci#toc2 |title=Pravopis Srpskog Jezika| chapter=Genitivni znak |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. According to [[Turkish Language Association]] orthography, ''d\u00fczeltme i\u015fareti'' \"correction mark\" over ''a'', ''i'' and ''u'' marks a [[long vowel]] to disambiguate similar words. For example, compare ''ama'' \"but\" and ''\u00e2m\u00e2'' \"blind\", ''\u015fura'' 'that place, there' and ''\u015f\u00fbra'' \"council\".<ref name=\"tdk\">[http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF4EC2F94D94121ECE www.tdk.gov.tr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221180227/http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF4EC2F94D94121ECE |date=2007-02-21 }}</ref> In general, circumflexes occur only in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] [[loanwords]] as vowel length in early Turkish was not phonemic. However, this standard was never applied entirely consistently<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Geoffrey|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|year=1999}}</ref> and by the early 21st century many publications had stopped using circumflexes almost entirely.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kornfilt|first=Jaklin|title=Turkish|year=2013}}</ref> \n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The circumflex is known as ''hirnod'' \"long sign\" or ''acen grom'' \"crooked accent\", but more usually and colloquially as ''to bach'' \"little roof\". It lengthens a stressed vowel (''a, e, i, o, u, w, y''), and is used particularly to differentiate between [[homonym|homographs]]; e.g. ''tan'' and ''t\u00e2n'', ''ffon'' and ''ff\u00f4n'', ''gem'' and ''g\u00eam'', ''cyn'' and ''c\u0177n'', or ''gwn'' and ''g\u0175n''. However the circumflex is only required on elongated vowels if the same word exists without the circumflex - \"nos\" (night), for example, has an elongated \"o\" sound but a circumflex is not required as the same word with a shortened \"o\" doesn't exist.\n* In [[Ad\u00fbnaic]], the [[Black Speech]], and [[Khuzdul]], constructed languages of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], all long vowels are transcribed with the circumflex. In [[Sindarin]], another of Tolkien's languages, long vowels in [[syllable|polysyllabic]] words take the [[acute accent|acute]], but a circumflex in monosyllables, to mark a [[phoneme|non-phonemic]] extra lengthening.\n\n==== Stress ====\n[[File:27 Y Par\u00ead.jpg|thumb|Bilingual sign showing the use of the circumflex in Welsh as an indicator of length and stress: ''par\u00ead'' [pa\u02c8re\u02d0d] \"parade\", as opposed to ''pared'' [\u02c8par\u025bd] \"partition wall\".]]\nThe circumflex accent marks the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]] of a word in some languages:\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''\u00e2'', ''\u00ea'', and ''\u00f4'' are stressed \u201cclosed\u201d vowels, opposed to their open counterparts ''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', and ''\u00f3'' (see below).\n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: the circumflex, due to its function as a disambiguating lengthening sign (see above), is used in polysyllabic words with word-final long vowels. The circumflex thus indicates the stressed syllable (which would normally be on the [[penult|penultimate syllable]]), since in Welsh, non-stressed vowels may not normally be long. This happens notably where the singular ends in an ''a'',  to, e.g. singular ''camera'', ''drama'', ''opera'', ''sinema'' \u2192 plural ''camer\u00e2u'', ''dram\u00e2u'', ''oper\u00e2u'', ''sinem\u00e2u''; however, it also occurs in singular nominal forms, e.g. ''arwyddoc\u00e2d''; in verbal forms, e.g. ''deffr\u00f4nt'', ''cryff\u00e2nt''; etc.\n\n==== Vowel quality ====\n*In [[Bamanankan language|Bamanankan]], it marks a ''falling tone'', as opposed to a [[h\u00e1\u010dek]] which signifies that on this syllable, the tone is rising.\n*In [[Breton language|Breton]], it is used on an ''e'' to show that the letter is pronounced [[Vowel height|open]] instead of closed.\n* In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the sound represented in Bulgarian by the Cyrillic letter ''\u044a'' (''er goljam'') is usually transliterated as ''\u00e2'' in systems used prior to 1989. Although called a [[schwa]] (misleadingly suggesting an unstressed lax sound), it is more accurately described as a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel#Mid back unrounded vowel|mid back unrounded vowel]] {{IPAslink|\u0264}}. Unlike [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]], but similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], it can be stressed.\n* In [[Pinyin]] romanized [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], ''\u00ea'' is used to represent the sound {{IPAslink|\u025b}} in isolation, which occurs sometimes as an exclamation.\n* In French, the letter ''\u00ea'' is normally pronounced [[open-mid vowel|open]], like ''\u00e8''. In the usual pronunciations of central and northern [[France]], ''\u00f4'' is pronounced [[close-mid vowel|close]], like ''eau''; in Southern France, no distinction is made between [[close-mid vowel|close]] and [[open-mid vowel|open]] ''o''.\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''\u00e2'' {{IPAslink|\u0250}}, ''\u00ea'' {{IPAslink|e}}, and ''\u00f4'' {{IPAslink|o}} are stressed high vowels, in opposition to ''\u00e1'' {{IPAslink|a}}, ''\u00e9'' {{IPAslink|\u025b}}, and ''\u00f3'' {{IPAslink|\u0254}}, which are stressed low vowels.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the circumflex is used on the vowels ''\u00e2'' and ''\u00ee'' to mark the vowel {{IPAslink|\u0268}}, similar to Russian ''[[yery]]''. The names of these accented letters are ''\u00e2 din a'' and ''\u00ee din i'', respectively. (The letter ''\u00e2'' only appears in the middle of words; thus, its [[majuscule]] version appears only in all-capitals inscriptions.)\n* In [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the circumflex (''vok\u00e1\u0148'') turns the letter ''o'' into a [[diphthong]]: ''\u00f4'' {{IPA|/uo/}}.\n* In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[dialect]] and [[folklore]] [[literature]] the circumflex is used to indicate the phonemes {{IPAslink|a|a(\u02d0)}} or {{IPAslink|\u00e6|\u00e6(\u02d0)}} ''(\u00e2)'', {{IPAslink|\u0276|\u0276(\u02d0)}} or {{IPAslink|\u025e|\u025e(\u02d0)}} (''\u00f4'') and {{IPAslink|\u0275|\u0275(\u02d0)}} (''\u00fb'') in dialects and regional accents where these are distinct from {{IPAslink|\u0251|\u0251(\u02d0)}} (''a''), {{IPAslink|\u00f8|\u00f8(\u02d0)}} (''\u00f6'') or {{IPAslink|o|o(\u02d0)}} (''o'' or ''\u00e5'') and {{IPAslink|\u0289|\u0289(\u02d0)}} (''u'') respectively, unlike Standard Swedish where {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}, {{IPA|[\u0275]}} and {{IPA|[\u0289\u02d0]}} are short and long allophones of the phonemes {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0289/}} respectively, and where [[Old Swedish]] short {{IPAslink|o}} (''\u014f'') has merged with {{IPA|/o(\u02d0)/}} from Old Swedish {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} (''\u0101'', Modern Swedish ''[[\u00e5]]'') instead of centralizing to {{IPA|[\u025e]}} or fronting to {{IPA|[\u0276]}} and remaining a distinct phoneme (''\u00f4'') as in the dialects in question. Different methods can be found in different literature, so some author may use ''\u00e6'' instead of ''\u00e2'', or use ''\u00e2'' where others use ''\u00e5\u0302'' (''\u00e5'' with a circumflex; for a sound between  {{IPA|/\u0251(\u02d0)/}} and {{IPA|/o(\u02d0)/}}).\n* [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''\u00e2'' {{IPAslink|\u0259}}, ''\u00ea'' {{IPAslink|e}}, and ''\u00f4'' {{IPAslink|o}} are higher vowels than ''a'' {{IPAslink|\u0251}}, ''e'' {{IPAslink|\u025b}}, and ''o'' {{IPAslink|\u0254}}. The circumflex can appear together with a [[Tonal language#Notational systems|tone mark]] on the same vowel, as in the word ''Vi\u1ec7t''.  Vowels with circumflex are considered separate letters from the base vowels.\n\n====Other articulatory features====\n* In [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], ''\u00ea \u00f4'' [e\u02d0, o\u02d0] denote both length and height. In [[Romagnol dialect|Romagnol]], they are used to represent the diphthongs /e\u0259, o\u0259/, whose specific articulation varies between dialects, e.g. ''s\u00eal'' [se\u0259l~se\u025bl~s\u00e6\u025bl~s\u025b\u0258l] \"salt\".\n* In [[Chichewa language|Chichewa]], ''\u0175'' (present for example in the name of the country ''[[Malawi|Mala\u0175i]]'') used to denote the [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPAslink|\u03b2}}; nowadays, however, most Chichewa-speakers pronounce it as a regular {{IPAblink|w}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Malawi: Mal\u00e1ui, Malaui, Malau\u00ed, Malavi ou Mal\u00e1vi?|url = http://dicionarioegramatica.com.br/2015/10/25/malawi-malaui-malaui-malaui-malavi-ou-malavi/|website = DicionarioeGramatica.com.br|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}</ref>\n* In [[Pinyin]], the romanized writing of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], ''\u1e91'', ''\u0109'', and ''\u015d'' are, albeit rarely, used to represent ''zh'' {{IPAblink|t\u0282}}, ''ch'' {{IPAblink|t\u0282\u02b0}}, and ''sh'' {{IPAblink|\u0282}}, respectively.\n* In [[Esperanto]], the circumflex is used on ''\u0109'' {{IPAblink|t\u0283}}, ''\u011d'' {{IPAblink|d\u0292}}, ''\u0125'' {{IPAblink|x}}, ''\u0135'' {{IPAblink|\u0292}}, ''\u015d'' {{IPAblink|\u0283}}.

The circumflex over ''i'' is used to indicate a [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] suffix (''mill\u00ee'', ''din\u00ee'').<ref name=\"tdk\"/>\n* In the African language [[Venda language|Venda]], a circumflex below d, l, n, and t is used to represent dental consonants: \u1e13, \u1e3d, \u1e4b, \u1e71.\n* In the 18th century, the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] introduced the circumflex accent in Spanish to mark that a ''ch'' or ''x'' were pronounced [k] and [ks] respectively (instead of [t\u0283] and [x], which were the default values): ''ch\u00e2racteres, ex\u00e2cto'' (spelled today ''caracteres, exacto''). This usage was quickly abandoned during the same century, once the RAE decided to use ''ch'' and ''x'' with one assigned pronunciation only: [t\u0283] and [ks] respectively.\n* In [[Domari language|Domari]] (according to the Pan-Domari Alphabet orthography), the circumflex is used on the letters <''\u0109 \u011d \u0135 \u015d \u1e91''> to represent the sounds of /t\u0361\u0283 \u0263 d\u0361\u0292 \u0283 \u0292/. It is also used above vowels to indicate length.\n\n===Abbreviation, contraction, and disambiguation===\n\n==== English ====\nIn 18th century [[British English]], before the cheap [[Penny Post]] and while paper was taxed, the combination ''ough'' was occasionally shortened to ''\u00f4'' when the ''gh'' was not pronounced, to save space: ''th\u00f4'' for ''though'', ''thor\u00f4'' for ''thorough'', and ''br\u00f4t'' for ''brought''.\n\n==== French ====\n{{Main|Circumflex in French}}\nIn [[French alphabet|French]], the circumflex generally marks the former presence of a consonant (usually ''s'') that was [[deletion (phonology)|deleted]] and is no longer pronounced. (The corresponding [[Norman French]] words, and consequently the words derived from them in English, frequently retain the lost consonant.) For example:\n*''anc\u00eatre'' \"ancestor\"\n*''h\u00f4pital'' \"hospital\"\n*''h\u00f4tel'' \"hostel\"\n*''for\u00eat'' \"forest\"\n*''r\u00f4tir'' \"to roast\"\n*''c\u00f4te'' \"rib, coast, slope\"\n*''p\u00e2t\u00e9'' \"paste\"\n*''ao\u00fbt'' \"August\"\n*''d\u00e9p\u00f4t'' (from the Latin ''depositum'' 'deposit', but now referring to both a deposit or a storehouse of any kind)<ref>{{cite web|title=\"D\u00e9p\u00f4t\" definition|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/d%C3%A9p%C3%B4t/23875|website=Larousse|accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome [[homophone]]s (or near-homophones in some varieties of French) are distinguished by the circumflex. However, \u00e2, \u00ea and \u00f4 distinguish different sounds in most varieties of French, for instance ''cote'' {{IPA-fr|k\u0254t|}} \"level, mark, code number\" and ''c\u00f4te'' {{IPA-fr|kot|}} \"rib, coast, hillside\".\n\nIn handwritten French, for example in taking notes, an ''m'' with a circumflex (m\u0302) is an informal abbreviation for ''m\u00eame'' \"same\".\n\nIn February 2016, the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise decided to remove the circumflex from about 2000 words, a plan that had been outlined since 1990. However, usage of the circumflex would not be considered incorrect.<ref>{{cite news|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35496893|agency=BBC|date=5 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Italian ====\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], ''\u00ee'' is occasionally used in the plural of nouns and adjectives ending with ''-io'' {{IPA-it|jo|}} as a [[crasis]] mark. Other possible spellings are ''-ii'' and obsolete ''-j'' or ''-ij''. For example, the plural of ''vario'' {{IPA-it|\u02c8va\u02d0rjo|}} \"various\" can be spelt ''vari'', ''var\u00ee'', ''varii''; the pronunciation will usually stay {{IPA-it|\u02c8va\u02d0ri|}} with only one {{IPA-it|i|}}. The plural forms of ''principe'' {{IPA-it|\u02c8print\u0283ipe|}} \"prince\" and of ''principio'' {{IPA-it|prin\u02c8t\u0283ipjo|}} \"principle, beginning\" can be confusing. In pronunciation, they are distinguished by whether the stress is on the first or on the second syllable, but ''principi'' would be a correct spelling of both. When necessary to avoid ambiguity, it is advised to write the plural of ''principio'' as ''princip\u00ee'' or as ''principii''.\n\n==== Norwegian ====\nIn [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the circumflex differentiates ''f\u00f4r'' \"lining, fodder\" from the preposition ''for''. From a historical point of view, the circumflex also indicates that the word used to be spelled with the letter ''[[\u00f0]]'' in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]{{spaced ndash}}for example, ''f\u00f4r'' is derived from  ''f\u00f3\u00f0r'', ''l\u00ear'' 'leather' from ''le\u00f0r'', and ''v\u00ear'' \"weather, ram\" from ''ve\u00f0r'' (both ''l\u00ear'' and ''v\u00ear'' only occur in the [[Nynorsk]] spelling; in [[Bokm\u00e5l]] these words are spelled ''l\u00e6r'' and ''v\u00e6r''). After the ''\u00f0'' disappeared, it was replaced by a ''[[d]]'' (''fodr, vedr'').\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{main|Hat operator}}\nIn mathematics, the circumflex is used to modify variable names; it is usually read \"hat\", e.g., '''\u00ee''' is \"i hat\". The [[Fourier transform]] of a function ''\u0192'' is often denoted by <math>\\hat f</math>.\n\nIn the notation of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s, a hat above an element signifies that the element was removed from the set, such as in <math>\\{x_0, \\dotsc, \\hat x_i, \\dotsc, x_n\\}</math>, the set containing all elements <math>x_0, \\dotsc, x_n</math> except <math>x_i</math>.\n\nIn geometry, a hat is sometimes used for an [[angle]]. For instance, the angles <math>\\hat{A}</math> or <math>A\\hat{B}C</math>.\n\nIn vector notation, a hat above a letter indicates a [[unit vector]] (a dimensionless [[vector (geometric)|vector]] with a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of 1). For instance, <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{\\imath}}</math>, <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}</math>, or <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1</math> stands for a unit vector in the direction of the [[x-axis]] of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\nIn [[statistics]], the hat is used to denote an [[estimator]] or an estimated value, as opposed to its theoretical counterpart. For example, in [[errors and residuals]], the hat in <math>\\hat\\varepsilon</math> indicates an observable estimate (the residual) of an unobservable quantity called <math>\\varepsilon</math> (the statistical error). It is read ''x-hat'' or ''x-roof'', where ''x'' represents the character under the hat.\n\n===Music===\n\nIn [[music theory]] and [[musicology]], a circumflex above a numeral is used to make reference to a particular [[degree (music)|scale degree]].\n\nIn [[music notation]], a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron-shaped]] symbol placed above a note indicates [[marcato]], a special form of emphasis or [[accent (music)|accent]]. In music for [[string instrument]]s, a narrow inverted chevron indicates that a note should be performed up-bow.\n\n== Circumflex in digital character sets ==\n\nThe [[precomposed character]]s ''\u00c2/\u00e2'', ''\u00ca/\u00ea'', ''\u00ce/\u00ee'', ''\u00d4/\u00f4'', and ''\u00db/\u00fb'' (which incorporate the circumflex) are included in the [[ISO-8859-1]] character set, and dozens more are available in [[Unicode]]. In addition, Unicode has {{unichar|0302|Combining circumflex accent|cwith=\u25cc|nlink=combining character}} and {{unichar|032D|Combining circumflex accent below|cwith=\u25cc}} which in principle allow adding the diacritic to any base letter.\n\nFor historical reasons, there is a similar but larger character, {{unichar|005E|circumflex accent|html=}} (<code>&amp;Hat;</code> in HTML5<ref>HTML5 is the only version of HTML that has a named entity for the circumflex, see https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html (\"The following sections present the complete lists of character entity references.\") and https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html5-20140731/syntax.html#named-character-references (\"Hat;\").</ref>), which is also included in [[ASCII]] but often referred to as [[caret]] instead. It is, however, unsuitable for use as a diacritic on modern computer systems, as it is a spacing character. Another spacing circumflex character in Unicode is the smaller {{unichar|02C6|modifier letter circumflex accent|nlink=Modifier letter|use=IPA}}, mainly used in [[Phonetics|phonetic]] notations{{spaced ndash}}or as a sample of the diacritic in isolation.\n\n===Typing the circumflex accent===\n{{Uncommon Unicode notice|section|compact=y}}\nIn countries where the local language(s) routinely include letters with a circumflex, local keyboards are typically engraved with those symbols. For users with American or British [[QWERTY]] keyboards, the characters \u00e2, \u0109, \u00ea, \u011d, \u0125, \u00ee, \u0135, \u00f4, \u015d, \u00fb, \u1e83, \u00fd (and their uppercase equivalents) may be obtained after installing the [[British and American keyboards#International or extended keyboard layouts|International or extended keyboard layout setting]]. Then, by using {{keypress|AltGr|6}} ([[caret|^]]), release, then {{keypress|w}} etc. (The {{keypress|AltGr|6}} is a dead key that applies the diacritic to the subsequent letter, if valid). Alternatively for systems with a [[compose key|'compose' function]], use {{keypress|compose|^|w|chain=}}, etc.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Caret]]\n* [[Caron]]\n* [[Circumflex in French]]\n* [[Macron (diacritic)]]\n* [[Tilde]]\n* [[Turned v]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|^}}\n* [http://diacritics.typo.cz Diacritics Project{{spaced ndash}}\"All you need to design a font with correct accents\"]\n* [http://afrikaans-spelling.blogspot.com ''Diacs and Quirks in a Nutshell{{spaced ndash}}Afrikaans spelling explained'']\n* [http://www.starr.net/is/type/kbh.html Keyboard Help]{{spaced ndash}}Learn how to create world language accent marks and other diacritics on a computer\n\n{{Latin script||circumflex}}\n\n[[Category:Latin-script diacritics]]\n[[Category:Greek-script diacritics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Diacritic in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts}}\n{{About|the diacritic used to modify other characters|use as an independent, spacing character|Caret}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}\n{{Diacritical marks|&circ;}}\n{{Letters with circumflex}}\nThe '''circumflex''' is a [[diacritic]] in the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] scripts that is used in the written forms of many languages and in various [[romanization]] and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] schemes. It received its English name from [[Latin]] ''circumflexus'' \"bent around\"{{mdash}}a translation of the Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c0\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 (''[[perispomenon|perisp\u014dm\u00e9n\u0113]]''). The circumflex in the Latin script is [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]-shaped ( '''\u02c6''' ), while the Greek circumflex may be displayed either like a [[tilde]] ( '''\u02dc''' ) or like an [[inverted breve]] ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&#785; ).\n\nIn [[English language|English]] the circumflex, like other diacritics, is sometimes retained on [[loanword]]s that used it in the original language (for example, ''[[cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]'').\n\nA similar typographical symbol, the [[caret]] ({{code|^}}) is used in [[proof-reading]], in [[programming]] and in [[mathematics]] (where it is typically called a '''hat''' or '''roof''' or '''house''').<ref> {{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hat.html |title=Hat |last=Weisstein |first=Eric W. |publisher=Wolfram  |website=Mathworld |access-date=29 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Phonetic marker===\n\n====Pitch====\n{{See also|Ancient Greek accent}}\nThe circumflex has its origins in the [[Greek diacritics|polytonic orthography]] of [[Ancient Greek]], where it marked [[vowel length|long vowels]] that were pronounced with high and then falling [[Pitch accent|pitch]]. In a similar vein, the circumflex is today used to mark [[tone contour]] in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].\n\nThe shape of the circumflex was originally a combination of the [[acute accent|acute]] and [[grave accent]]s (^), as it marked a [[syllable]] contracted from two vowels: an acute-accented vowel and a non-accented vowel (all non-accented syllables in Ancient Greek were once marked with a grave accent).<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]], ''A Greek Grammar for Colleges'' ([http://www.ccel.org/s/smyth/grammar/html/toc_uni.htm ccel.org]): \"155.

Examples of circumflex use in Afrikaans are ''s\u00ea'' \"to say\", ''w\u00eareld'' \"world\", ''m\u00f4re'' \"tomorrow\", ''br\u00fbe'' \"bridges\".\n* [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. In the transliteration of this language, the circumflex indicates a long vowel resulting from an [[aleph]] contraction.\n* In western [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Sauk language (Algonquian)|Sauk]], and [[Saulteaux language|Saulteaux]], the Algonquianist Standard Roman Orthography (SRO) indicates long vowels {{IPA|[a\u02d0 e\u02d0 i\u02d0 o\u02d0~u\u02d0]}} either with a circumflex \u27e8''\u00e2 \u00ea \u00ee \u00f4''\u27e9 or with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] \u27e8''\u0101 \u0113 \u012b \u014d''\u27e9.\n* The PDA orthography for [[Domari language|Domari]] uses circumflex-bearing vowels for length.\n* In [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], ''\u00e2 \u00ee \u00fb'' are used to represent {{IPA|[a\u02d0, i\u02d0, u\u02d0]}}\n\n* [[French language|French]]. In some varieties, such as in [[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]] and [[Acadian French]], vowels with a circumflex are long: ''f\u00eate'' {{IPA|[f\u025b\u02d0t]}} (party) is longer than ''faite'' {{IPA|[f\u025bt]}}. This [[compensatory lengthening|length compensates]] for a deleted consonant, usually ''s''.\n* [[Friulian language|Standard Friulian]].\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. In the [[Nihon-shiki]] system of [[Romaji|romanization]], the circumflex is used to indicate long vowels. The [[Kunrei-shiki]] system, which is based on Nihon-shiki system, also uses the circumflex. The Traditional and Modified forms of the [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]] system use the [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] for this purpose, though some users may use the circumflex as a substitute if there are difficulties inputting the macron, as the two diacritics are visually similar.\n* [[J\u00e8rriais]].\n* In [[Kurmanji|Kurmanji Kurdish]], \u27e8\u00ea \u00ee \u00fb\u27e9 are used to represent {{IPA|/e\u02d0 i\u02d0 u\u02d0/}}. <ref>{{cite web|page=11|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Kurmanji/kurmanji_1_grammar.pdf|title=Kurmanji Kurdish: A Reference Grammar with Selected Readings|last=Thackston|first=Wheeler M.|date =  2006| website =Iranian Studies at Harvard University  | publisher = [[Harvard University]]| access-date = November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian language]].\n* In [[Luxembourgish]] ''m\u0302 n\u0302'' can be used to indicate nasalisation of a vowel. Also, the circumflex can be over the vowel to indicate nasalisation. In either case, the circumflex is rare.\n* [[Old Malay]]\n* In [[Serbo-Croatian]] the circumflex can be used to distinguish [[homograph]]s, and it is called the \"genitive sign\" or \"length sign\". Examples include ''sam'' \"am\" versus ''s\u00e2m'' \"alone\". For example, the phrase \"I am alone\" may be written ''Ja sam s\u00e2m'' to improve clarity. Another example: ''da'' \"yes\", ''d\u00e2'' \"gives\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.srpskijezickiatelje.com/pravopis:ostali-znaci#toc2 |title=Pravopis Srpskog Jezika| chapter=Genitivni znak |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. According to [[Turkish Language Association]] orthography, ''d\u00fczeltme i\u015fareti'' \"correction mark\" over ''a'', ''i'' and ''u'' marks a [[long vowel]] to disambiguate similar words.

However, this standard was never applied entirely consistently<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Geoffrey|title=The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success|year=1999}}</ref> and by the early 21st century many publications had stopped using circumflexes almost entirely.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kornfilt|first=Jaklin|title=Turkish|year=2013}}</ref> \n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The circumflex is known as ''hirnod'' \"long sign\" or ''acen grom'' \"crooked accent\", but more usually and colloquially as ''to bach'' \"little roof\". It lengthens a stressed vowel (''a, e, i, o, u, w, y''), and is used particularly to differentiate between [[homonym|homographs]]; e.g. ''tan'' and ''t\u00e2n'', ''ffon'' and ''ff\u00f4n'', ''gem'' and ''g\u00eam'', ''cyn'' and ''c\u0177n'', or ''gwn'' and ''g\u0175n''. However the circumflex is only required on elongated vowels if the same word exists without the circumflex - \"nos\" (night), for example, has an elongated \"o\" sound but a circumflex is not required as the same word with a shortened \"o\" doesn't exist.\n* In [[Ad\u00fbnaic]], the [[Black Speech]], and [[Khuzdul]], constructed languages of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], all long vowels are transcribed with the circumflex. In [[Sindarin]], another of Tolkien's languages, long vowels in [[syllable|polysyllabic]] words take the [[acute accent|acute]], but a circumflex in monosyllables, to mark a [[phoneme|non-phonemic]] extra lengthening.\n\n==== Stress ====\n[[File:27 Y Par\u00ead.jpg|thumb|Bilingual sign showing the use of the circumflex in Welsh as an indicator of length and stress: ''par\u00ead'' [pa\u02c8re\u02d0d] \"parade\", as opposed to ''pared'' [\u02c8par\u025bd] \"partition wall\".]]\nThe circumflex accent marks the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]] of a word in some languages:\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''\u00e2'', ''\u00ea'', and ''\u00f4'' are stressed \u201cclosed\u201d vowels, opposed to their open counterparts ''\u00e1'', ''\u00e9'', and ''\u00f3'' (see below).\n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: the circumflex, due to its function as a disambiguating lengthening sign (see above), is used in polysyllabic words with word-final long vowels. The circumflex thus indicates the stressed syllable (which would normally be on the [[penult|penultimate syllable]]), since in Welsh, non-stressed vowels may not normally be long. This happens notably where the singular ends in an ''a'',  to, e.g. singular ''camera'', ''drama'', ''opera'', ''sinema'' \u2192 plural ''camer\u00e2u'', ''dram\u00e2u'', ''oper\u00e2u'', ''sinem\u00e2u''; however, it also occurs in singular nominal forms, e.g. ''arwyddoc\u00e2d''; in verbal forms, e.g. ''deffr\u00f4nt'', ''cryff\u00e2nt''; etc.\n\n==== Vowel quality ====\n*In [[Bamanankan language|Bamanankan]], it marks a ''falling tone'', as opposed to a [[h\u00e1\u010dek]] which signifies that on this syllable, the tone is rising.\n*In [[Breton language|Breton]], it is used on an ''e'' to show that the letter is pronounced [[Vowel height|open]] instead of closed.\n* In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the sound represented in Bulgarian by the Cyrillic letter ''\u044a'' (''er goljam'') is usually transliterated as ''\u00e2'' in systems used prior to 1989. Although called a [[schwa]] (misleadingly suggesting an unstressed lax sound), it is more accurately described as a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel#Mid back unrounded vowel|mid back unrounded vowel]] {{IPAslink|\u0264}}. Unlike [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]], but similar to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], it can be stressed.\n* In [[Pinyin]] romanized [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], ''\u00ea'' is used to represent the sound {{IPAslink|\u025b}} in isolation, which occurs sometimes as an exclamation.\n* In French, the letter ''\u00ea'' is normally pronounced [[open-mid vowel|open]], like ''\u00e8''. In the usual pronunciations of central and northern [[France]], ''\u00f4'' is pronounced [[close-mid vowel|close]], like ''eau''; in Southern France, no distinction is made between [[close-mid vowel|close]] and [[open-mid vowel|open]] ''o''.\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''\u00e2'' {{IPAslink|\u0250}}, ''\u00ea'' {{IPAslink|e}}, and ''\u00f4'' {{IPAslink|o}} are stressed high vowels, in opposition to ''\u00e1'' {{IPAslink|a}}, ''\u00e9'' {{IPAslink|\u025b}}, and ''\u00f3'' {{IPAslink|\u0254}}, which are stressed low vowels.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the circumflex is used on the vowels ''\u00e2'' and ''\u00ee'' to mark the vowel {{IPAslink|\u0268}}, similar to Russian ''[[yery]]''. The names of these accented letters are ''\u00e2 din a'' and ''\u00ee din i'', respectively. (The letter ''\u00e2'' only appears in the middle of words; thus, its [[majuscule]] version appears only in all-capitals inscriptions.)\n* In [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the circumflex (''vok\u00e1\u0148'') turns the letter ''o'' into a [[diphthong]]: ''\u00f4'' {{IPA|/uo/}}.\n* In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[dialect]] and [[folklore]] [[literature]] the circumflex is used to indicate the phonemes {{IPAslink|a|a(\u02d0)}} or {{IPAslink|\u00e6|\u00e6(\u02d0)}} ''(\u00e2)'', {{IPAslink|\u0276|\u0276(\u02d0)}} or {{IPAslink|\u025e|\u025e(\u02d0)}} (''\u00f4'') and {{IPAslink|\u0275|\u0275(\u02d0)}} (''\u00fb'') in dialects and regional accents where these are distinct from {{IPAslink|\u0251|\u0251(\u02d0)}} (''a''), {{IPAslink|\u00f8|\u00f8(\u02d0)}} (''\u00f6'') or {{IPAslink|o|o(\u02d0)}} (''o'' or ''\u00e5'') and {{IPAslink|\u0289|\u0289(\u02d0)}} (''u'') respectively, unlike Standard Swedish where {{IPA|[a]}} and {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}, {{IPA|[\u0275]}} and {{IPA|[\u0289\u02d0]}} are short and long allophones of the phonemes {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/\u0289/}} respectively, and where [[Old Swedish]] short {{IPAslink|o}} (''\u014f'') has merged with {{IPA|/o(\u02d0)/}} from Old Swedish {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} (''\u0101'', Modern Swedish ''[[\u00e5]]'') instead of centralizing to {{IPA|[\u025e]}} or fronting to {{IPA|[\u0276]}} and remaining a distinct phoneme (''\u00f4'') as in the dialects in question. Different methods can be found in different literature, so some author may use ''\u00e6'' instead of ''\u00e2'', or use ''\u00e2'' where others use ''\u00e5\u0302'' (''\u00e5'' with a circumflex; for a sound between  {{IPA|/\u0251(\u02d0)/}} and {{IPA|/o(\u02d0)/}}).\n* [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''\u00e2'' {{IPAslink|\u0259}}, ''\u00ea'' {{IPAslink|e}}, and ''\u00f4'' {{IPAslink|o}} are higher vowels than ''a'' {{IPAslink|\u0251}}, ''e'' {{IPAslink|\u025b}}, and ''o'' {{IPAslink|\u0254}}. The circumflex can appear together with a [[Tonal language#Notational systems|tone mark]] on the same vowel, as in the word ''Vi\u1ec7t''.  Vowels with circumflex are considered separate letters from the base vowels.\n\n====Other articulatory features====\n* In [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], ''\u00ea \u00f4'' [e\u02d0, o\u02d0] denote both length and height. In [[Romagnol dialect|Romagnol]], they are used to represent the diphthongs /e\u0259, o\u0259/, whose specific articulation varies between dialects, e.g. ''s\u00eal'' [se\u0259l~se\u025bl~s\u00e6\u025bl~s\u025b\u0258l] \"salt\".\n* In [[Chichewa language|Chichewa]], ''\u0175'' (present for example in the name of the country ''[[Malawi|Mala\u0175i]]'') used to denote the [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPAslink|\u03b2}}; nowadays, however, most Chichewa-speakers pronounce it as a regular {{IPAblink|w}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Malawi: Mal\u00e1ui, Malaui, Malau\u00ed, Malavi ou Mal\u00e1vi?|url = http://dicionarioegramatica.com.br/2015/10/25/malawi-malaui-malaui-malaui-malavi-ou-malavi/|website = DicionarioeGramatica.com.br|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}</ref>\n* In [[Pinyin]], the romanized writing of [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], ''\u1e91'', ''\u0109'', and ''\u015d'' are, albeit rarely, used to represent ''zh'' {{IPAblink|t\u0282}}, ''ch'' {{IPAblink|t\u0282\u02b0}}, and ''sh'' {{IPAblink|\u0282}}, respectively.\n* In [[Esperanto]], the circumflex is used on ''\u0109'' {{IPAblink|t\u0283}}, ''\u011d'' {{IPAblink|d\u0292}}, ''\u0125'' {{IPAblink|x}}, ''\u0135'' {{IPAblink|\u0292}}, ''\u015d'' {{IPAblink|\u0283}}.

The circumflex over ''i'' is used to indicate a [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] suffix (''mill\u00ee'', ''din\u00ee'').<ref name=\"tdk\"/>\n* In the African language [[Venda language|Venda]], a circumflex below d, l, n, and t is used to represent dental consonants: \u1e13, \u1e3d, \u1e4b, \u1e71.\n* In the 18th century, the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] introduced the circumflex accent in Spanish to mark that a ''ch'' or ''x'' were pronounced [k] and [ks] respectively (instead of [t\u0283] and [x], which were the default values): ''ch\u00e2racteres, ex\u00e2cto'' (spelled today ''caracteres, exacto''). This usage was quickly abandoned during the same century, once the RAE decided to use ''ch'' and ''x'' with one assigned pronunciation only: [t\u0283] and [ks] respectively.\n* In [[Domari language|Domari]] (according to the Pan-Domari Alphabet orthography), the circumflex is used on the letters <''\u0109 \u011d \u0135 \u015d \u1e91''> to represent the sounds of /t\u0361\u0283 \u0263 d\u0361\u0292 \u0283 \u0292/. It is also used above vowels to indicate length.\n\n===Abbreviation, contraction, and disambiguation===\n\n==== English ====\nIn 18th century [[British English]], before the cheap [[Penny Post]] and while paper was taxed, the combination ''ough'' was occasionally shortened to ''\u00f4'' when the ''gh'' was not pronounced, to save space: ''th\u00f4'' for ''though'', ''thor\u00f4'' for ''thorough'', and ''br\u00f4t'' for ''brought''.\n\n==== French ====\n{{Main|Circumflex in French}}\nIn [[French alphabet|French]], the circumflex generally marks the former presence of a consonant (usually ''s'') that was [[deletion (phonology)|deleted]] and is no longer pronounced. (The corresponding [[Norman French]] words, and consequently the words derived from them in English, frequently retain the lost consonant.) For example:\n*''anc\u00eatre'' \"ancestor\"\n*''h\u00f4pital'' \"hospital\"\n*''h\u00f4tel'' \"hostel\"\n*''for\u00eat'' \"forest\"\n*''r\u00f4tir'' \"to roast\"\n*''c\u00f4te'' \"rib, coast, slope\"\n*''p\u00e2t\u00e9'' \"paste\"\n*''ao\u00fbt'' \"August\"\n*''d\u00e9p\u00f4t'' (from the Latin ''depositum'' 'deposit', but now referring to both a deposit or a storehouse of any kind)<ref>{{cite web|title=\"D\u00e9p\u00f4t\" definition|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/d%C3%A9p%C3%B4t/23875|website=Larousse|accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome [[homophone]]s (or near-homophones in some varieties of French) are distinguished by the circumflex. However, \u00e2, \u00ea and \u00f4 distinguish different sounds in most varieties of French, for instance ''cote'' {{IPA-fr|k\u0254t|}} \"level, mark, code number\" and ''c\u00f4te'' {{IPA-fr|kot|}} \"rib, coast, hillside\".\n\nIn handwritten French, for example in taking notes, an ''m'' with a circumflex (m\u0302) is an informal abbreviation for ''m\u00eame'' \"same\".\n\nIn February 2016, the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise decided to remove the circumflex from about 2000 words, a plan that had been outlined since 1990. However, usage of the circumflex would not be considered incorrect.<ref>{{cite news|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35496893|agency=BBC|date=5 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==== Italian ====\nIn [[Italian language|Italian]], ''\u00ee'' is occasionally used in the plural of nouns and adjectives ending with ''-io'' {{IPA-it|jo|}} as a [[crasis]] mark. Other possible spellings are ''-ii'' and obsolete ''-j'' or ''-ij''. For example, the plural of ''vario'' {{IPA-it|\u02c8va\u02d0rjo|}} \"various\" can be spelt ''vari'', ''var\u00ee'', ''varii''; the pronunciation will usually stay {{IPA-it|\u02c8va\u02d0ri|}} with only one {{IPA-it|i|}}. The plural forms of ''principe'' {{IPA-it|\u02c8print\u0283ipe|}} \"prince\" and of ''principio'' {{IPA-it|prin\u02c8t\u0283ipjo|}} \"principle, beginning\" can be confusing. In pronunciation, they are distinguished by whether the stress is on the first or on the second syllable, but ''principi'' would be a correct spelling of both. When necessary to avoid ambiguity, it is advised to write the plural of ''principio'' as ''princip\u00ee'' or as ''principii''.\n\n==== Norwegian ====\nIn [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the circumflex differentiates ''f\u00f4r'' \"lining, fodder\" from the preposition ''for''. From a historical point of view, the circumflex also indicates that the word used to be spelled with the letter ''[[\u00f0]]'' in [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]{{spaced ndash}}for example, ''f\u00f4r'' is derived from  ''f\u00f3\u00f0r'', ''l\u00ear'' 'leather' from ''le\u00f0r'', and ''v\u00ear'' \"weather, ram\" from ''ve\u00f0r'' (both ''l\u00ear'' and ''v\u00ear'' only occur in the [[Nynorsk]] spelling; in [[Bokm\u00e5l]] these words are spelled ''l\u00e6r'' and ''v\u00e6r''). After the ''\u00f0'' disappeared, it was replaced by a ''[[d]]'' (''fodr, vedr'').\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{main|Hat operator}}\nIn mathematics, the circumflex is used to modify variable names; it is usually read \"hat\", e.g., '''\u00ee''' is \"i hat\". The [[Fourier transform]] of a function ''\u0192'' is often denoted by <math>\\hat f</math>.\n\nIn the notation of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s, a hat above an element signifies that the element was removed from the set, such as in <math>\\{x_0, \\dotsc, \\hat x_i, \\dotsc, x_n\\}</math>, the set containing all elements <math>x_0, \\dotsc, x_n</math> except <math>x_i</math>.\n\nIn geometry, a hat is sometimes used for an [[angle]]. For instance, the angles <math>\\hat{A}</math> or <math>A\\hat{B}C</math>.\n\nIn vector notation, a hat above a letter indicates a [[unit vector]] (a dimensionless [[vector (geometric)|vector]] with a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of 1). For instance, <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{\\imath}}</math>, <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}</math>, or <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1</math> stands for a unit vector in the direction of the [[x-axis]] of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\nIn [[statistics]], the hat is used to denote an [[estimator]] or an estimated value, as opposed to its theoretical counterpart. For example, in [[errors and residuals]], the hat in <math>\\hat\\varepsilon</math> indicates an observable estimate (the residual) of an unobservable quantity called <math>\\varepsilon</math> (the statistical error). It is read ''x-hat'' or ''x-roof'', where ''x'' represents the character under the hat.\n\n===Music===\n\nIn [[music theory]] and [[musicology]], a circumflex above a numeral is used to make reference to a particular [[degree (music)|scale degree]].\n\nIn [[music notation]], a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron-shaped]] symbol placed above a note indicates [[marcato]], a special form of emphasis or [[accent (music)|accent]]. In music for [[string instrument]]s, a narrow inverted chevron indicates that a note should be performed up-bow.\n\n== Circumflex in digital character sets ==\n\nThe [[precomposed character]]s ''\u00c2/\u00e2'', ''\u00ca/\u00ea'', ''\u00ce/\u00ee'', ''\u00d4/\u00f4'', and ''\u00db/\u00fb'' (which incorporate the circumflex) are included in the [[ISO-8859-1]] character set, and dozens more are available in [[Unicode]]. In addition, Unicode has {{unichar|0302|Combining circumflex accent|cwith=\u25cc|nlink=combining character}} and {{unichar|032D|Combining circumflex accent below|cwith=\u25cc}} which in principle allow adding the diacritic to any base letter.\n\nFor historical reasons, there is a similar but larger character, {{unichar|005E|circumflex accent|html=}} (<code>&amp;Hat;</code> in HTML5<ref>HTML5 is the only version of HTML that has a named entity for the circumflex, see https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html (\"The following sections present the complete lists of character entity references.\") and https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-html5-20140731/syntax.html#named-character-references (\"Hat;\").</ref>), which is also included in [[ASCII]] but often referred to as [[caret]] instead. It is, however, unsuitable for use as a diacritic on modern computer systems, as it is a spacing character. Another spacing circumflex character in Unicode is the smaller {{unichar|02C6|modifier letter circumflex accent|nlink=Modifier letter|use=IPA}}, mainly used in [[Phonetics|phonetic]] notations{{spaced ndash}}or as a sample of the diacritic in isolation.\n\n===Typing the circumflex accent===\n{{Uncommon Unicode notice|section|compact=y}}\nIn countries where the local language(s) routinely include letters with a circumflex, local keyboards are typically engraved with those symbols. For users with American or British [[QWERTY]] keyboards, the characters \u00e2, \u0109, \u00ea, \u011d, \u0125, \u00ee, \u0135, \u00f4, \u015d, \u00fb, \u1e83, \u00fd (and their uppercase equivalents) may be obtained after installing the [[British and American keyboards#International or extended keyboard layouts|International or extended keyboard layout setting]].
