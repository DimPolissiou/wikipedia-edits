During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the [[Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts]] and [[David Garrick]]'s library of 1,000 printed plays.

A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a \"Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble\". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.\n\n===Growth and change (1800\u20131825)===\n\n[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]\n[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]\n\nIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] \u2013 key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.<ref>''Wondrous Curiosities \u2013 Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66\u201372 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, {{ISBN|0-226-54209-2}})</ref> Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.<ref>''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref> Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805.

The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857, [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].<ref>Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755\u20131846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.\n\n===Collecting from the wider world (1850\u20131875)===\nThe opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].\n\nRoughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the \"second founder\" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].<ref name=\"world and its people\"/> The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dickens Charles Jr. |author-link=Charles Dickens Jr. |year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...]; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A.

A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the [[Louis, Duke of Blacas|Duke of Blacas]]'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].<ref>South from Ephesus \u2013 An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33\u201334,(Brian Sewell, 2002, {{ISBN|1-903933-16-1}})</ref>\n\n===Scholarship and legacies (1875\u20131900)===\nThe natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and [[ethnography]] and the library could further expand.

In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A. W.

In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the west, north and east sides of the museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.\n\nAll the while, the collections kept growing. [[Emil Torday]] collected in Central Africa, [[Marc Aurel Stein|Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia, [[David George Hogarth|D.G. Hogarth]], [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]] excavated at [[Carchemish]]. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist [[J Pierpont Morgan]] donated a substantial number of objects to the museum,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=101677&peoA=101677-3-9| title=British Museum \u2013 Collection search: You searched for| work=British Museum}}</ref> including [[William Greenwell]]'s collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for \u00a310,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]]'s coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son [[J. P. Morgan Jr.|John Pierpont Morgan Junior]] in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated via the [[London Post Office Railway]] to Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.<ref>Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence) {{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_scientific/history.aspx| title=History| work=British Museum}}</ref> In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.\n\n===Disruption and reconstruction (1925\u20131950)===\nNew [[mezzanine]] floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting: <blockquote>The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour<ref>Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125</ref></blockquote>}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids, the Parthenon Sculptures, along with the museum's most valued collections, were dispersed to secure basements, [[English country house|country houses]], [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych Underground station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.<ref>Cook, B.F. (2005). The Elgin Marbles. London: The British Museum Press, pg 92</ref> Meanwhile, prior to the war, the Nazis had sent a researcher to the British Museum for several years with the aim of \"compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry\".<ref name=\"germanlibrariesaronsfeld\">{{cite journal|last1=Aronsfeld|first1=C.

For instance, they arranged for a German researcher to spend several years at the British Museum for the purpose of compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry, which, at the time, with its 562 pages and a bibliography of some 600 items, was an effort more ambitious than hitherto attempted.}}</ref> After the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley]]'s 1922\u201334 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.\n\n===A new public face (1950\u20131975)===\n[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]\n\nIn 1953, the museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in-house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, the [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[board of trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the [[British Museum Department of Coins and Medals|Coins and Medals]] office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270</ref> In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery: <blockquote>It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.<ref>Ashmole (1994), 126</ref></blockquote> It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.}}\n\nBy the 1970s the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition \"Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]\" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints & drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra {{convert|1+1/4|mi}} of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.\n\n===The Great Court emerges (1975\u20132000)===\nThe departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] \u2013 the largest covered square in Europe \u2013 which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at [[6 Burlington Gardens]] from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.\n\nThe museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in \"modern\" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 327</ref>\n\n===The British Museum today===\n[[File:The British Museum today.jpg|thumb|right|Wide view of the Great Court]]\nToday the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over 13 million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.\n\nThe [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.\n\nWith the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family \u2013 with the donation valued at \u00a325 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of its very large website, the museum has the largest [[online database]] of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> There is also a \"Highlights\" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum</ref> In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\" />\n\nIn 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\">{{Cite news| title=British Museum gets record 6.7m visitors for 2013| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-25729616| newspaper=BBC News| accessdate=20 March 2014| date=14 January 2014}}</ref> Popular exhibitions including \"Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum\" and \"Ice Age Art\" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors.<ref name=Smithers_tourists>{{Cite news| last=Smithers| first=Rebecca| title=Sunny weather drew record numbers to UK's outdoor tourist hotspots in 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/sunny-weather-record-uk-tourists-2013| newspaper=The Guardian| date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in conjunction with members of the public.<ref>{{Cite news| title=British Museum to be digitally recreated in Minecraft| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29281051| last1=Miller| first1=Joe| newspaper=BBC News |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement.

The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906\u201314 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.\n\nThe [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962.

Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)</ref> from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].\n\nBy 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]]. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including [[Flinders Petrie]]'s Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the [[Oxford University]] Expedition to [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] and [[Faras]] in Sudan.\n\n[[File:England; London - The British Museum, Egypt Egyptian Sculpture ~ Colossal granite head of Amenhotep III (Room 4).2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Room 4 \u2013 [[Colossal red granite statue of Amenhotep III]], 1350 BC]]\nActive support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern [[Dongola Reach]] (1990s).

Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm ([[University of Munich]]) and William Adams ([[University of Kentucky]]).\n\nThe seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]]. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[File:TombofNebamun-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 61 \u2013 The famous false fresco 'Pond in a Garden' from the [[Tomb of Nebamun]], c. 1350 BC]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 4 \u2013 The [[Rosetta Stone]], key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 196 BC]]\n'''Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC \u2013 c. 2690 BC)'''\n*Mummy of [[Gebelein predynastic mummies|''Ginger'']] from Gebelein, (c. 3400 BC)\n*The [[Battlefield Palette]] and [[Hunters Palette]], two cosmetic palettes with complex decorative schemes, (c. 3100 BC)\n*Stela of King [[Peribsen]], Abydos, (c. 2720\u20132710 BC)\n\n'''Old Kingdom (2690\u20132181 BC)'''\n*Granite statue of Ankhwa, the shipbuilder, [[Saqqara]], Egypt, 3rd Dynasty, (around 2650 BC)\n*Several of the original casing stones from the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], (c. 2570 BC)\n*Wooden tomb statue of Tjeti, Fifth to Sixth Dynasty, (about 2345\u20132181 BC)\n\n'''Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)'''\n*Inner and outer coffin of Sebekhetepi, [[Beni Hasan]], (about 2125\u20131795 BC)\n*Limestone stela of Heqaib, [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Egypt, 12th Dynasty, (1990\u20131750 BC)\n*Block statue and stela of Sahathor, 12th Dynasty, reign of [[Amenemhat II]], (about 1922\u20131878 BC)\n\n'''New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)'''\n*Fragment of the beard of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], (14th century BC)\n*[[Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III|Colossal head from a statue]] of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)\n*Colossal limestone bust of [[Amenhotep III]], (1350 BC)\n*[[Amarna letters|Amarna Tablets]], 99 out of 382 [[Clay tablet|tablets]] found, second greatest collection in the world after the Vorderasiatisches Museum, [[Berlin]] (203 tablets), (1350 BC)\n*[[List of pharaohs|List of the kings]] of Egypt from the [[Abydos, Egypt|Temple of Ramesses II]], (1250 BC)\n\n'''Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013664 BC)'''\n*Mummy case and coffin of Nesperennub, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], (c.800 BC)\n*[[Statues of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa|Statue of Amun]] in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa, (683 BC)\n*Inner and outer coffins of the priest Hor, Deir el-Bahari, Thebes, 25th Dynasty, (about 680 BC)\n\n'''Late Period (664\u2013332 BC)'''\n*Saite Sarcophagus of Satsobek, the vizier (prime minister) of the northern part of Egypt in the reign of [[Psammetichus I]], (664\u2013610 BC)\n*Bronze figure of Isis and Horus, North [[Saqqara]], Egypt, (600 BC)\n*[[Obelisks of Nectanebo II|Obelisks]] and sarcophagus of Pharaoh [[Nectanebo II]], (360\u2013343 BC)\n\n'''Ptolemaic dynasty (305\u201330 BC)'''\n*The famous [[Rosetta Stone]], trilingual stela that unlocked the ancient Egyptian civilisation, (196 BC)\n*Giant sculpture of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]], (32\u201330 BC)\n*Mummy of [[Hornedjitef]] (inner coffin), Thebes, (3rd century BC)\n\n'''Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)'''\n*The Meriotic [[Hamadab Stela]] from the [[Kingdom of Kush]] found near the ancient site of Mero\u00eb in Sudan, 24 BC\n*Lid of the coffin of Soter and Cleopatra from Qurna, Thebes, (early 2nd century AD)\n*Mummy of a youth with a portrait of the deceased, [[Hawara]], (100\u2013200 AD)\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Bm-ginger.jpg|Room 64 -

Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]], [[John Turtle Wood]], [[Robert Murdoch Smith]] and [[Charles Fellows]].\n\nThe Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of [[Magna Graecia]] that include Sicily and southern Italy. The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].<ref name=\"GreeceRome\"/>\n\nBeginning from the early [[Bronze Age]], the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and non-Greek colonies in [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] on Asia Minor. There is some material from the [[Roman Republic]], but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the [[Roman Empire]], with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).\n\nThe collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s and [[Edm\u00e9-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand]]'s collections), [[Glass|Roman glass]] including the famous [[Cameo glass]] Portland Vase, [[Roman mosaic]]s from [[Carthage]] and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in North Africa that were excavated by [[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], and silver hoards from [[Roman Gaul]] (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee [[Richard Payne Knight]]), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir [[Robert Hamilton Lang]]'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the [[Charles Townley#Townley Collection|Townley collection]] as well as residual sculptures from the famous [[Farnese collection]].\n\nObjects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the [[architectural]] monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[Parthenon]]\n*The [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles (Elgin Marbles)]], (447\u2013438 BC)\n\n[[Erechtheion]]\n*A surviving column, (420\u2013415 BC)\n*One of six remaining [[Caryatid]]s, (415 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Athena Nike]]\n*Surviving [[frieze]] slabs, (427\u2013424 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Bassae]]\n*Twenty-three surviving blocks of the [[Bassae Frieze|frieze]] from the interior of the temple, (420\u2013400 BC)\n\n[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]\n*Two colossal free-standing figures identified as Maussollos and his wife [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], (c. 350 BC)\n*Part of an impressive horse from the [[chariot]] group adorning the summit of the [[Mausoleum]], (c. 350 BC)\n*The [[Amazonomachy]] frieze \u2013 A long section of relief frieze showing the battle between Greeks and [[Amazons]], (c. 350 BC)\n\n[[Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]]\n*One of the sculptured column bases, (340\u2013320 BC)\n*Part of the [[Ionic order|Ionic]] frieze situated above the colonnade, (330\u2013300 BC)\n\n[[Knidos]] in Asia Minor\n*[[Demeter of Knidos]], (350 BC)\n*[[Lion of Knidos]], (350\u2013200 BC)\n\n[[Xanthos]] in Asia Minor\n*Lion Tomb, (550\u2013500 BC)\n*[[Harpy Tomb]], (480\u2013470 BC)\n*[[Nereid Monument]], partial reconstruction of a large and elaborate Lykian tomb, (390\u2013380 BC)\n*Tomb of Merehi, (390\u2013350 BC)\n*[[Tomb of Payava]], (375\u2013350 BC)\n\n'''Wider collection'''\n\n'''Prehistoric Greece and Italy (3300 BC \u2013 8th century BC)'''\n*Over thirty [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figures]] from islands in the Aegean Sea, many collected by [[James Theodore Bent]], Greece, (3300\u20132000 BC)\n*Material from the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]] including a huge pottery storage jar, some donated by Sir [[Arthur Evans]], Crete, Greece, (1900\u20131100 BC)\n*The Minoan gold treasure from [[Aegina Treasure|Aegina]], northern Aegean, Greece, (1850\u20131550 BC)\n*Segments of the columns and architraves from the [[Treasury of Atreus]], Peloponnese, Greece, (1350\u20131250 BC)\n*[[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] Amphora, highly decorated pottery vase attributed to the [[Dipylon Master]], Athens, Greece, (8th century BC)\n*[[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl]]\n\n'''Etruscan (8th century BC \u2013 1st century BC)'''\n*Some of the artefacts from the Castellani Tomb in [[Palestrina]], central Italy, (8th\u20136th century BC)\n*Contents of the [[Isis Tomb, Vulci]], (570\u2013560 BC)\n*Painted terracotta plaques (the so-called ''Boccanera Plaques'') from a tomb in [[Cerveteri]], (560\u2013550 BC)\n*[[Oscan Tablet]], one of the most important inscriptions in the Oscan language, (300\u2013100 BC)\n*[[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]] from Chiusi, (150\u2013140 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Greece (8th century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Group of life-size [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] statues from the Sacred Way at [[Didyma]], western Turkey, (600\u2013580 BC)\n*[[Priene Inscription|Dedicatory Inscription by Alexander the Great]] from Priene in Turkey (330 BC)\n*Head from the colossal statue of the [[Asclepius of Milos]], Greece, (325\u2013300 BC)\n*Bronze sculpture of a Greek poet known as the [[Arundel Head]], western Turkey, (2nd\u20131st centuries BC)\n*Remains of the [[Scylla]] monument at [[Bargylia]], south west Anatolia, Turkey, (200\u2013150 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Rome (1st century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Cameo glass [[Portland Vase]], the most famous glass vessel from ancient Rome, (1\u201325 AD)\n*Silver [[Warren Cup]] with homoerotic scenes, found near Jerusalem, (5\u201315 AD)\n*[[Discobolus|Discus-thrower (Discobolos)]]<ref>Tony Kitto, \"The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737\u20131805\" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase.

A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].\n\nThe collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century.\n\nThe first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, palace reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.\n[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's & Full Projection.3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Room 6 \u2013 Pair of [[Lamassu|Human Headed Winged Lions]] and reliefs from [[Nimrud]] with the [[Balawat Gates]], c. 860 BC]]\n\n[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|Room 52 \u2013 Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559\u2013530 BC]]\nLayard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852\u20131854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and [[Lachish relief]]s. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].\n\nIn the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919\u201324. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nAlthough the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.\n\nFrom the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935\u20131938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (Jericho) in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932\u20131938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.\n\nThe museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&type=museum&theme=ISL&|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and [[Mughal paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.\n\nA representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite web

There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.<ref name=bmgal/> The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the [[Western art history|European schools]]. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine [[printmaking]] from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century. Key benefactors to the department have been [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]], [[Richard Payne Knight]], John Malcolm, [[Campbell Dodgson]], C\u00e9sar Mange de Hauke and [[Tom\u00e1s Harris]].\n\nThere are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon]]), [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W.

There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints.

It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[Prehistoric]] and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods throughout the world, as well as from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]], and [[Gertrude Caton\u2013Thompson]]. Paleolithic objects from the [[William Allen Sturge|Sturge]], [[Henry Christy|Christy]] and [[\u00c9douard Lartet|Lartet]] collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as [[William Greenwell|Greenwell]] in Britain, [[Thomas Tobin|Tobin]] and Cooke in Ireland, [[William Collings Lukis|Lukis]] and de la Granci\u00e8re in Brittany, [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|Worsaae]] in Denmark, [[Luis Siret|Siret]] at [[El Argar]] in Spain, and [[Gustav Klemm|Klemm]] and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from [[Hallstatt]] were acquired as a result of the [[Sir John Evans|Evans]]/[[Sir John Lubbock|Lubbock]] excavations and from [[Giubiasco]] in [[Ticino]] through the [[Swiss National Museum]].\n\nIn addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]]; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include [[Latvia]]n, [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Gotland]]ic and [[Merovingian]] material from [[Johann Karl B\u00e4hr]], Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the [[Sutton Hoo]] royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner [[Edith Pretty]]. The department includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the [[Octavius Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Courtenay Adrian Ilbert|Ilbert]] collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects \u2013 the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian [[Charles Roach Smith]] in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.\n\nObjects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its [[archive]] facilities, where it is available for [[research]] and study.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n'''Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC \u2013 c. 2000 BC)'''\n*[[Palaeolithic]] material from across Africa, particularly [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]], [[Kalambo Falls]], [[Olorgesailie]] and [[Cape Flats]], (1.8 million BC onwards)\n*One of

Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]\nThe scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the [[British Empire]], especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as [[Charles Stuart (East India Company officer)|Charles Stuart]], [[James Prinsep]], [[Charles Masson]], Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], Sir [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]] and Sir [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker [[George Eumorfopoulos]] in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie|url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921153753/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|archivedate=21 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427102637/http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|archive-date=27 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] (much assembled by the British naval officer [[Maurice Vidal Portman|Maurice Portman]]), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator [[Hugh Nevill]]), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the [[Sarawak]] collection put together by Dr [[Charles Hose]], as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a [[gamelan]] musical set, was assembled by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]].\n\nThe principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and [[calligraphy]], and Chinese ceramics collections.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/departments_all_relationships.aspx?Title=Asia&ContentType=Department&PageId=551 |title=Department of Asia \u2013 Related Highlight Objects |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n*The most comprehensive collection of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent in the world, including the celebrated [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] limestone reliefs from [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]] excavated by Sir [[Walter Elliot (Scottish naturalist)|Walter Elliot]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/galleries/asia/room_33a_amaravati.aspx |title=Room 33a: Amaravati |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n*An outstanding collection of Chinese antiquities, paintings, and porcelain, lacquer, bronze, jade, and other applied arts\n*The most comprehensive collection of [[Japanese art|Japanese pre-20th century art]] in the Western world, many of which originally belonged to the surgeon [[William Anderson (collector)|William Anderson]] and diplomat [[Ernest Mason Satow]]\n\n'''East Asia'''\n*A large collection of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], (from c. 1500 BC onwards)\n*[[Huixian Bronze Hu]], an identical pair of bronze vessels from the [[Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou period]], China, (5th century BC)\n*Japanese antiquities from the [[Kofun period]] excavated by the pioneering archaeologist [[William Gowland]], (3rd\u20136th centuries AD)\n*The famous [[Admonitions Scroll]] by Chinese artist [[Gu Kaizhi]], (344\u2013406 AD)\n*The colossal [[Amit\u0101bha Buddha from Hancui]], China, (585 AD)\n*A set of ceramic [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], (c.728 AD)\n*[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], one from a set of eight surviving statues, China, (907\u20131125 AD)\n*A fine assemblage of Buddhist paintings from [[Dunhuang]], western China, collected by the British-Hungarian explorer [[Aurel Stein]], (5th\u201311th centuries AD)\n*[[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art|Pericival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics, (10th\u201318th centuries AD)\n*Ivory stand in the form of a seated lion, Chos-'khor-yan-rtse monastery in [[Tibet]], (13th century AD)\n*Pair of ceramic [[Kakiemon elephants]] from Japan, (17th century AD)\n*Japanese prints including [[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], (1829\u201332)\n\n'''South Asia'''\n*Excavated objects from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] sites of [[Mohenjo-daro]], and [[Harappa]], [[Ancient India]] (now in [[Pakistan]]), (2500\u20132000 BC)\n*Sandstone fragment of a [[Pillars of Ashoka|Pillar of Ashoka]] with [[Brahmi]] inscription from [[Meerut]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], (238 BC)\n*The [[Kulu Vase]] found near a monastery in [[Himachal Pradesh]], one of the earliest examples of figurative art from the sub-continent, northern India, (1st century BC)\n*[[Taxila copper plate|Copper plate]] from [[Taxila]], with important Kharoshthi inscription, [[Ancient India]](now in [[Pakistan]]), (1st century BC \u2013 1st century AD)\n*Indo-Scythian sandstone [[Mathura lion capital|Mathura Lion Capital]] and [[Sanchi Yakshi Figure|Bracket figure]] from one of the gateways to the Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]], central India, (1st century AD)\n*[[Bimaran casket|Bimaran Casket]] and [[Wardak Vase]], reliquaries from ancient stupas in Afghanistan, (1st\u20132nd centuries AD)\n*Relic deposits from the stupas at [[Manikyala]], [[Ahin Posh]], [[Sanchi]] and [[Gudivada]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*[[Seated Buddha from Gandhara]], and other Gandhara objects from [[Kafir Kot]], [[Jamal Garhi]] and [[Takht-i-Bahi]], [[Pakistan]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*The [[Buddhapad Hoard]] of bronze images from southern India, (6th\u20138th centuries AD)\n*Stone statue of Buddha from the [[Sultanganj Buddha|Sultanganj]] hoard, Bihar, eastern India.

Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by [[Henry Christy]], [[Harry Geoffrey Beasley|Harry Beasley]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman|William Oldman]] are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays [[ethnographic]] from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on [[North America]] and [[Mexico]]. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.\n\n'''Africa'''\n[[File:African_throwing_knives.jpg|thumb|left|Room 25 \u2013 Collection of African [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]]]]\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at [[Senegambian stone circles|megalithic circles]] in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in west Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from [[Ife]], a similar [[terracotta]] head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an [[Ikom monoliths|Ikom monolith]] from [[Cross River State]], the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the [[Kuba Kingdom]] including three [[Ndop (Kuba)|royal figures]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from [[Gondar]] and [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]], Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] (that includes a unique soapstone, [[anthropomorphic]] figure) and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].\n\n'''Oceania'''\n\nThe British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] \u2013 Aboriginal art from [[Australia]] is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped [[pestle]] and a group of stone [[Pestle and mortar|mortars]] from [[Papua New Guinea]]. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir [[George Grey]], Sir [[Frederick Broome]] and [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. A poignant artefact is the wooden [[Gweagal#The_Gweagal_Spears_and_Shield|shield]] found near [[Botany Bay]] during Cook's first voyage in 1770. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] and [[Katherine Routledge]].\n\nIn addition, the [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and [[Hei-tiki|jade objects]] and the [[Aboriginal art]] collection is distinguished by its wide range of [[bark paintings]], including two very early bark etchings collected by [[John Hunter Kerr]]. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[statue of A'a from Rurutu]] Island, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|deity figure]].  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of [[K\u016b|K\u016b-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].\n\n'''Americas'''\nThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadian]] objects from Alaska and Canada collected by the [[Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale|5th Earl of Lonsdale]] and the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquis of Lorne]], the [[E. G. Squier|Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis|Davis]] collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a selection of pottery vessels found in cliff-dwellings at [[Mesa Verde]], a collection of turquoise Aztec [[Double-headed serpent|mosaics]] from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from [[Teotihuacan Ocelot|Teotihuacan]] and [[Isla de Sacrificios]], several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]] and [[Codex Waecker-Gotter]], a spectacular series of Mayan [[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|lintels]] from [[Yaxchilan]] excavated by the British Mayanist [[Alfred Maudslay]], a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from [[Cop\u00e1n Bench Panel|Copan]], [[Tikal Temple I|Tikal]], [[Tulum Stela 1|Tulum]], [[Pusilha]], [[Naranjo]] and [[Nebaj]] (including the celebrated [[Fenton Vase]]), a group of [[Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica]], a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and [[Lake Guatavita|votive]] objects from Colombia, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk|Schomburgk]] collection, two rare [[Tiwanaku]] pottery vessels from [[Lake Titicaca]] and important items from [[Tierra del Fuego]] donated by Commander [[Phillip Parker King]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:British Museum otter pipe.jpg|Room 26 - Stone pipe representing an otter from [[Hopewell Culture National Historical Park|Mound City]], Ohio, USA, 200 BC - 400 AD\nFile:British Museum tomb guardian.jpg|Room 2 - Stone tomb guardian, part human part jaguar, from [[San Agust\u00edn, Huila|San Agust\u00edn]], Colombia, c. 300-600 AD\nFile:Maya maize god statue.jpg|Room 1 - Maya maize god statue from [[Cop\u00e1n]], Honduras, 600-800 AD\nFile:Gold Lime Flasks (poporos) Quimbaya Culture, Colombia AD 600-1100 - British Museum.jpg|Room 24 - Gold Lime Flasks (poporos), [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya Culture]], Colombia, 600-1100 AD\nFile:Maya, lintel 25, da yaxchilan, 725.JPG|Room 27 - Lintel 25 from [[Yaxchilan]], Late Classic, Mexico, 600-900 AD\nFile:Bird pectoral, Popayan, gold alloy, AD900\u20131600..jpg|Room 24 - Bird pectoral made from gold alloy, [[Popay\u00e1n]], Colombia, 900-1600 AD\nFile:Hoa Hakananai'a - Moai in the British Museum.jpeg|Room 24 \u2013 Rapa Nui statue [[Hoa Hakananai'a]], 1000 AD, [[Wellcome Trust]] Gallery\nFile:Denis Bourez - British Museum, London (8748174360).jpg|Room 27 - [[Double-headed serpent]] turquoise mosaic, Aztec, Mexico, 1400-1500 AD\nFile:Denis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747055335).jpg|Room 27 - Turquoise Mosaic Mask, [[Mixtec]]-[[Aztec]], Mexico, 1400-1500 AD\nFile:Miniature gold llama figurine.jpg|Room 2 - Miniature gold llama figurine, [[Inca]], Peru, about 1500 AD\nFile:Benin Bronzes at the British Museum 1.jpg|Room 25 - Part of the famous collection of Benin brass plaques, [[Nigeria]], 1500-1600 AD\nFile:Benin brass plaque 01.jpg|Room 25 - Detail of one of the [[Benin Empire|Benin]] brass plaques in the museum, Nigeria, 1500-1600 AD\nFile:Idia mask BM Af1910 5-13 1.jpg|Room 25 - [[Benin ivory mask]] of Queen Idia, Nigeria, 16th century AD\nFile:Hawaiian feather helmet, British Museum 3.jpg|Room 24 - Hawaiian feather helmet or [[mahiole]], late 1700s AD\nFile:British museum, totem.JPG|Great Court - Two house frontal [[Kayung totem pole|totem poles]], Haida, British Columbia, Canada, about 1850 AD\nFile:Punu mask BM Af1904 11-22 1.jpg|Room 25 - Mask (wood and pigment); Punu people, [[Gabon]], 19th century AD\nFile:Otobo masquerade.jpg|Room 25 - Otobo masquerade in the Africa Gallery, Nigeria, 20th century AD\nFile:El Anatsui - Man's Cloth.jpg|Room 25 - Modern interpretation of [[kente cloth]] from [[Ghana]], late 20th century AD\n</gallery>\n\n===Department of Coins and Medals===\n    {{main|British Museum Department of Coins and Medals}}\n\nThe British Museum is home to one of the world's finest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. The Department of Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/research_publications_series/2011/the_future_of_UK_numismatics.aspx ''The British Museum and the Future of UK Numismatics.

The science department<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/science/index.html|title=British Museum \u2013 Conservation and Scientific Research|work=thebritishmuseum.ac.uk}}</ref> has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.\n\n===Libraries and archives===\nThis department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The [[Anthropology]] Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes.<ref>See the \"Facilities and Services\" tab on the home page for each department for details on each library; not all are kept at Bloomsbury.

Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece were also claimed by UNESCO among others for restitution.

The bequest of a collection of books, [[engraved gem]]s, coins, prints and drawings by [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] in 1800 did much to raise the museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.<ref>BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820).

A list of donations to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a \"Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble\". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.\n\n===Growth and change (1800\u20131825)===\n\n[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]\n[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]\n\nIn the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] \u2013 key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.<ref>''Wondrous Curiosities \u2013 Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66\u201372 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, {{ISBN|0-226-54209-2}})</ref> Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.<ref>''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref> Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805.

In 1816 these masterpieces of western art, were acquired by The British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter.<ref>The British Museum \u2013 The Elgin Marbles, p. 85 (B.F.Cook, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7141-2134-7}}</ref> The collections were supplemented by the [[Bassae]] frieze from [[Phigalia|Phigaleia]], [[Greece]] in 1815.

Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840\u20131859|Act of Parliament of 1856]] established the Gallery as an independent body.</ref> the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the [[Natural history]] collections.<ref>The Story of the British Museum, p. 25 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7141-2772-8}})</ref>\n\n===The largest building site in Europe (1825\u20131850)===\n[[File:Image-The Grenville Library (1875).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas Grenville|Grenville]] Library, 1875]]\nThe museum became a construction site as [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s grand [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] building gradually arose. The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857, [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].<ref>Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755\u20131846), a trustee of the British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.\n\n===Collecting from the wider world (1850\u20131875)===\nThe opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].\n\nRoughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the \"second founder\" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].<ref name=\"world and its people\"/> The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dickens Charles Jr. |author-link=Charles Dickens Jr. |year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...]; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A.

A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the [[Louis, Duke of Blacas|Duke of Blacas]]'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].<ref>South from Ephesus \u2013 An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33\u201334,(Brian Sewell, 2002, {{ISBN|1-903933-16-1}})</ref>\n\n===Scholarship and legacies (1875\u20131900)===\nThe natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]].

In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A. W.

Morgan Jr.|John Pierpont Morgan Junior]] in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated via the [[London Post Office Railway]] to Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931.

In 1931, the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting: <blockquote>The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour<ref>Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125</ref></blockquote>}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids, the Parthenon Sculptures, along with the museum's most valued collections, were dispersed to secure basements, [[English country house|country houses]], [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych Underground station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry.

For instance, they arranged for a German researcher to spend several years at the British Museum for the purpose of compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry, which, at the time, with its 562 pages and a bibliography of some 600 items, was an effort more ambitious than hitherto attempted.}}</ref> After the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley]]'s 1922\u201334 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.\n\n===A new public face (1950\u20131975)===\n[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]\n\nIn 1953, the museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, the [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[board of trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the [[British Museum Department of Coins and Medals|Coins and Medals]] office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270</ref> In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|1=Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery: <blockquote>It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.<ref>Ashmole (1994), 126</ref></blockquote> It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.}}\n\nBy the 1970s the museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition \"Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]\" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints & drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra {{convert|1+1/4|mi}} of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.\n\n===The Great Court emerges (1975\u20132000)===\nThe departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] \u2013 the largest covered square in Europe \u2013 which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at [[6 Burlington Gardens]] from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.\n\nThe museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in \"modern\" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.<ref>Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 327</ref>\n\n===The British Museum today===\n[[File:The British Museum today.jpg|thumb|right|Wide view of the Great Court]]\nToday the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over 13 million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.\n\nThe [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.\n\nWith the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family \u2013 with the donation valued at \u00a325 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of its very large website, the museum has the largest [[online database]] of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> There is also a \"Highlights\" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum</ref> In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\" />\n\nIn 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year.<ref name=\"BBC_museum#\">{{Cite news| title=British Museum gets record 6.7m visitors for 2013| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-25729616| newspaper=BBC News| accessdate=20 March 2014| date=14 January 2014}}</ref> Popular exhibitions including \"Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum\" and \"Ice Age Art\" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors.<ref name=Smithers_tourists>{{Cite news| last=Smithers| first=Rebecca| title=Sunny weather drew record numbers to UK's outdoor tourist hotspots in 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/sunny-weather-record-uk-tourists-2013| newspaper=The Guardian| date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in conjunction with members of the public.<ref>{{Cite news| title=British Museum to be digitally recreated in Minecraft| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29281051| last1=Miller| first1=Joe| newspaper=BBC News |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement.

The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906\u201314 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.\n\nThe [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during [[World War II]] bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south-west corner of the museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase \u2013 this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.<ref>pp. 65\u201366, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill & Christopher Date 1999</ref>\n\nThe [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers [[Buro Happold]] and the architects [[Foster and Partners]].<ref>Norman Foster and the British Museum, Norman Foster, Deyan Sudjic & Spencer de Grey 2001</ref> The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe.

After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French]] forces under [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Giovanni Belzoni]]. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].\n\nBy 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from [[Amarna]], [[Bubastis]] and [[Deir el-Bahari]].

The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including [[Asyut]] (1907), [[El-Badari|Mostagedda]] and [[El-Badari|Matmar]] (1920s), [[Ashmunein]] (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as [[Soba (city)|Soba]], Kawa and the Northern [[Dongola Reach]] (1990s).

A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the museum.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[File:TombofNebamun-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 61 \u2013 The famous false fresco 'Pond in a Garden' from the [[Tomb of Nebamun]], c. 1350 BC]]\n[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Room 4 \u2013 The [[Rosetta Stone]], key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, 196 BC]]\n'''Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC \u2013 c. 2690 BC)'''\n*Mummy of [[Gebelein predynastic mummies|''Ginger'']] from Gebelein, (c. 3400 BC)\n*The [[Battlefield Palette]] and [[Hunters Palette]], two cosmetic palettes with complex decorative schemes, (c. 3100 BC)\n*Stela of King [[Peribsen]], Abydos, (c. 2720\u20132710 BC)\n\n'''Old Kingdom (2690\u20132181 BC)'''\n*Granite statue of Ankhwa, the shipbuilder, [[Saqqara]], Egypt, 3rd Dynasty, (around 2650 BC)\n*Several of the original casing stones from the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], (c. 2570 BC)\n*Wooden tomb statue of Tjeti, Fifth to Sixth Dynasty, (about 2345\u20132181 BC)\n\n'''Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)'''\n*Inner and outer coffin of Sebekhetepi, [[Beni Hasan]], (about 2125\u20131795 BC)\n*Limestone stela of Heqaib, [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Egypt, 12th Dynasty, (1990\u20131750 BC)\n*Block statue and stela of Sahathor, 12th Dynasty, reign of [[Amenemhat II]], (about 1922\u20131878 BC)\n\n'''New Kingdom (1549\u20131069 BC)'''\n*Fragment of the beard of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], (14th century BC)\n*[[Colossal quartzite statue of Amenhotep III|Colossal head from a statue]] of Amenhotep III, (1350 BC)\n*Colossal limestone bust of [[Amenhotep III]], (1350 BC)\n*[[Amarna letters|Amarna Tablets]], 99 out of 382 [[Clay tablet|tablets]] found, second greatest collection in the world after the Vorderasiatisches Museum, [[Berlin]] (203 tablets), (1350 BC)\n*[[List of pharaohs|List of the kings]] of Egypt from the [[Abydos, Egypt|Temple of Ramesses II]], (1250 BC)\n\n'''Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013664 BC)'''\n*Mummy case and coffin of Nesperennub, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], (c.800 BC)\n*[[Statues of Amun in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa|Statue of Amun]] in the form of a ram protecting King Taharqa, (683 BC)\n*Inner and outer coffins of the priest Hor, Deir el-Bahari, Thebes, 25th Dynasty, (about 680 BC)\n\n'''Late Period (664\u2013332 BC)'''\n*Saite Sarcophagus of Satsobek, the vizier (prime minister) of the northern part of Egypt in the reign of [[Psammetichus I]], (664\u2013610 BC)\n*Bronze figure of Isis and Horus, North [[Saqqara]], Egypt, (600 BC)\n*[[Obelisks of Nectanebo II|Obelisks]] and sarcophagus of Pharaoh [[Nectanebo II]], (360\u2013343 BC)\n\n'''Ptolemaic dynasty (305\u201330 BC)'''\n*The famous [[Rosetta Stone]], trilingual stela that unlocked the ancient Egyptian civilisation, (196 BC)\n*Giant sculpture of a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]], (32\u201330 BC)\n*Mummy of [[Hornedjitef]] (inner coffin), Thebes, (3rd century BC)\n\n'''Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)'''\n*The Meriotic [[Hamadab Stela]] from the [[Kingdom of Kush]] found near the ancient site of Mero\u00eb in Sudan, 24 BC\n*Lid of the coffin of Soter and Cleopatra from Qurna, Thebes, (early 2nd century AD)\n*Mummy of a youth with a portrait of the deceased, [[Hawara]], (100\u2013200 AD)\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"190px\">\nFile:Bm-ginger.jpg|Room 64 -

Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]], [[John Turtle Wood]], [[Robert Murdoch Smith]] and [[Charles Fellows]].\n\nThe Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of [[Magna Graecia]] that include Sicily and southern Italy. The [[Cyclades|Cycladic]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cultures are represented, and the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] collection includes important sculpture from the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, as well as elements of two of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] and the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]].<ref name=\"GreeceRome\"/>\n\nBeginning from the early [[Bronze Age]], the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from [[Ancient history of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and non-Greek colonies in [[Lycia]] and [[Caria]] on Asia Minor. There is some material from the [[Roman Republic]], but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the [[Roman Empire]], with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).\n\nThe collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s and [[Edm\u00e9-Antoine Durand|Chevalier Durand]]'s collections), [[Glass|Roman glass]] including the famous [[Cameo glass]] Portland Vase, [[Roman mosaic]]s from [[Carthage]] and [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] in North Africa that were excavated by [[Nathan Davis (traveller)|Nathan Davis]], and silver hoards from [[Roman Gaul]] (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee [[Richard Payne Knight]]), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir [[Robert Hamilton Lang]]'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the [[Charles Townley#Townley Collection|Townley collection]] as well as residual sculptures from the famous [[Farnese collection]].\n\nObjects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the [[architectural]] monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n[[Parthenon]]\n*The [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles (Elgin Marbles)]], (447\u2013438 BC)\n\n[[Erechtheion]]\n*A surviving column, (420\u2013415 BC)\n*One of six remaining [[Caryatid]]s, (415 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Athena Nike]]\n*Surviving [[frieze]] slabs, (427\u2013424 BC)\n\nTemple of [[Bassae]]\n*Twenty-three surviving blocks of the [[Bassae Frieze|frieze]] from the interior of the temple, (420\u2013400 BC)\n\n[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]\n*Two colossal free-standing figures identified as Maussollos and his wife [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], (c. 350 BC)\n*Part of an impressive horse from the [[chariot]] group adorning the summit of the [[Mausoleum]], (c. 350 BC)\n*The [[Amazonomachy]] frieze \u2013 A long section of relief frieze showing the battle between Greeks and [[Amazons]], (c. 350 BC)\n\n[[Temple of Artemis in Ephesus]]\n*One of the sculptured column bases, (340\u2013320 BC)\n*Part of the [[Ionic order|Ionic]] frieze situated above the colonnade, (330\u2013300 BC)\n\n[[Knidos]] in Asia Minor\n*[[Demeter of Knidos]], (350 BC)\n*[[Lion of Knidos]], (350\u2013200 BC)\n\n[[Xanthos]] in Asia Minor\n*Lion Tomb, (550\u2013500 BC)\n*[[Harpy Tomb]], (480\u2013470 BC)\n*[[Nereid Monument]], partial reconstruction of a large and elaborate Lykian tomb, (390\u2013380 BC)\n*Tomb of Merehi, (390\u2013350 BC)\n*[[Tomb of Payava]], (375\u2013350 BC)\n\n'''Wider collection'''\n\n'''Prehistoric Greece and Italy (3300 BC \u2013 8th century BC)'''\n*Over thirty [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figures]] from islands in the Aegean Sea, many collected by [[James Theodore Bent]], Greece, (3300\u20132000 BC)\n*Material from the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]] including a huge pottery storage jar, some donated by Sir [[Arthur Evans]], Crete, Greece, (1900\u20131100 BC)\n*The Minoan gold treasure from [[Aegina Treasure|Aegina]], northern Aegean, Greece, (1850\u20131550 BC)\n*Segments of the columns and architraves from the [[Treasury of Atreus]], Peloponnese, Greece, (1350\u20131250 BC)\n*[[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Elgin]] Amphora, highly decorated pottery vase attributed to the [[Dipylon Master]], Athens, Greece, (8th century BC)\n*[[Bronze Statuette of Athletic Spartan Girl]]\n\n'''Etruscan (8th century BC \u2013 1st century BC)'''\n*Some of the artefacts from the Castellani Tomb in [[Palestrina]], central Italy, (8th\u20136th century BC)\n*Contents of the [[Isis Tomb, Vulci]], (570\u2013560 BC)\n*Painted terracotta plaques (the so-called ''Boccanera Plaques'') from a tomb in [[Cerveteri]], (560\u2013550 BC)\n*[[Oscan Tablet]], one of the most important inscriptions in the Oscan language, (300\u2013100 BC)\n*[[Sarcophagus of Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa]] from Chiusi, (150\u2013140 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Greece (8th century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Group of life-size [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] statues from the Sacred Way at [[Didyma]], western Turkey, (600\u2013580 BC)\n*[[Priene Inscription|Dedicatory Inscription by Alexander the Great]] from Priene in Turkey (330 BC)\n*Head from the colossal statue of the [[Asclepius of Milos]], Greece, (325\u2013300 BC)\n*Bronze sculpture of a Greek poet known as the [[Arundel Head]], western Turkey, (2nd\u20131st centuries BC)\n*Remains of the [[Scylla]] monument at [[Bargylia]], south west Anatolia, Turkey, (200\u2013150 BC)\n\n'''Ancient Rome (1st century BC \u2013 4th century AD)'''\n*Cameo glass [[Portland Vase]], the most famous glass vessel from ancient Rome, (1\u201325 AD)\n*Silver [[Warren Cup]] with homoerotic scenes, found near Jerusalem, (5\u201315 AD)\n*[[Discobolus|Discus-thrower (Discobolos)]]<ref>Tony Kitto, \"The celebrated connoisseur: Charles Townley, 1737\u20131805\" ''Minerva Magazine'' May/June 2005, in connection with a British Museum exhibition celebrating the bicentennial of the Townley purchase.

A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyrian sculpture]], [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] from [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].\n\nThe collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], the [[Holy Land]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] and include objects from the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century.\n\nThe first significant addition of [[Mesopotamian]] objects was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]] in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, palace reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III]], were brought to the British Museum.\n[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's & Full Projection.3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Room 6 \u2013 Pair of [[Lamassu|Human Headed Winged Lions]] and reliefs from [[Nimrud]] with the [[Balawat Gates]], c. 860 BC]]\n\n[[File:London 307.JPG|thumb|Room 52 \u2013 Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559\u2013530 BC]]\nLayard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852\u20131854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous ''[[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal]]'' and [[Lachish relief]]s. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Nimrud ivories|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], important objects from [[Sippar]], and a fine collection of [[Urartu|Urartian]] bronzes from [[Toprakkale]].\n\nIn the early 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]] by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] in 1919\u201324. Woolley went on to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]]. The department also has three [[diorite]] statues of the ruler [[Statues of Gudea|Gudea]] from the ancient state of [[Lagash]] and a series of limestone [[kudurru]] or boundary stones from different locations across ancient [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nAlthough the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]] and the Hungarian-British explorer [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of [[Persepolis]] were donated by Sir [[Gore Ouseley]] in 1825 and the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 5th Earl of Aberdeen|5th Earl of Aberdeen]] in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid [[Household silver|silverware]] in the world. The later [[Sasanian Empire]] is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the [[Tharros]] collection from [[Sardinia]] and the large number of Phoenician stelae from [[Carthage]] are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is [[Ancient history of Yemen|Yemeni]] antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of [[Dilmun]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of [[A'ali]] and [[Shakhura]] in Bahrain.\n\nFrom the modern state of [[Syria]] come almost forty funerary busts from [[Palmyra]] and a group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]] that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935\u20131938 and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. Mallowan returned with his wife [[Agatha Christie]] to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many [[Nimrud Ivories|important artefacts]] for the museum. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened by the work of [[Kathleen Kenyon]] at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (Jericho) in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932\u20131938.  Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as [[:de:Tell es-Sa'idiyeh|Tell es Sa'idiyeh]] in Jordan.\n\nThe museum's collection of [[Islamic art]], including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pm_partner.php?id=Mus01;uk&type=museum&theme=ISL&|title=Museum With No Frontiers| publisher=Discover Islamic Art| accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from [[Spain]] in the west to [[India]] in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of [[\u0130znik pottery|Iznik]] ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]], mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the [[Zodiac]], a fine selection of [[astrolabes]], and [[Mughal paintings]] and precious artwork including a large [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad|jade terrapin]] made for the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as [[Siraf]] by [[David Whitehouse]] and [[Alamut Castle]] by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the [[Frederick DuCane Godman|Godman]] bequest of Iznik, [[Hispano-Moresque]] and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.\n\nA representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the [[Middle East]]. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite web

It ranks as one of the largest and best [[print room]] collections in existence alongside the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in Vienna, the Paris collections and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Study room page |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.<ref name=bmgal>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/galleries.aspx |title=Prints and Drawings galleries |work=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.<ref name=bmgal/> The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the [[Western art history|European schools]]. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine [[printmaking]] from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century. Key benefactors to the department have been [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]], [[Richard Payne Knight]], John Malcolm, [[Campbell Dodgson]], C\u00e9sar Mange de Hauke and [[Tom\u00e1s Harris]].\n\nThere are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon]]), [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W.

There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints.

It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[Prehistoric]] and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods throughout the world, as well as from the [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]], and [[Gertrude Caton\u2013Thompson]]. Paleolithic objects from the [[William Allen Sturge|Sturge]], [[Henry Christy|Christy]] and [[\u00c9douard Lartet|Lartet]] collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as [[William Greenwell|Greenwell]] in Britain, [[Thomas Tobin|Tobin]] and Cooke in Ireland, [[William Collings Lukis|Lukis]] and de la Granci\u00e8re in Brittany, [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae|Worsaae]] in Denmark, [[Luis Siret|Siret]] at [[El Argar]] in Spain, and [[Gustav Klemm|Klemm]] and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from [[Hallstatt]] were acquired as a result of the [[Sir John Evans|Evans]]/[[Sir John Lubbock|Lubbock]] excavations and from [[Giubiasco]] in [[Ticino]] through the [[Swiss National Museum]].\n\nIn addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]]; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include [[Latvia]]n, [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Gotland]]ic and [[Merovingian]] material from [[Johann Karl B\u00e4hr]], Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the [[Sutton Hoo]] royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner [[Edith Pretty]]. The department includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the [[Octavius Morgan|Morgan]] and [[Courtenay Adrian Ilbert|Ilbert]] collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects \u2013 the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]]. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian [[Charles Roach Smith]] in 1856.  These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.\n\nObjects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its [[archive]] facilities, where it is available for [[research]] and study.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:\n\n'''Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC \u2013 c. 2000 BC)'''\n*[[Palaeolithic]] material from across Africa, particularly [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]], [[Kalambo Falls]], [[Olorgesailie]] and [[Cape Flats]], (1.8 million BC onwards)\n*One of

Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]\nThe scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the [[British Empire]], especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as [[Charles Stuart (East India Company officer)|Charles Stuart]], [[James Prinsep]], [[Charles Masson]], Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]], Sir [[Harold Arthur Deane|Harold Deane]] and Sir [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker [[George Eumorfopoulos]] in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie|url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921153753/http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html|archivedate=21 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427102637/http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|archive-date=27 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] (much assembled by the British naval officer [[Maurice Vidal Portman|Maurice Portman]]), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator [[Hugh Nevill]]), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the [[Sarawak]] collection put together by Dr [[Charles Hose]], as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a [[gamelan]] musical set, was assembled by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]].\n\nThe principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and [[calligraphy]], and Chinese ceramics collections.\n\nKey highlights of the collections include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/departments_all_relationships.aspx?Title=Asia&ContentType=Department&PageId=551 |title=Department of Asia \u2013 Related Highlight Objects |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n*The most comprehensive collection of sculpture from the Indian subcontinent in the world, including the celebrated [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] limestone reliefs from [[Amaravati Marbles|Amaravati]] excavated by Sir [[Walter Elliot (Scottish naturalist)|Walter Elliot]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/explore/galleries/asia/room_33a_amaravati.aspx |title=Room 33a: Amaravati |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n*An outstanding collection of Chinese antiquities, paintings, and porcelain, lacquer, bronze, jade, and other applied arts\n*The most comprehensive collection of [[Japanese art|Japanese pre-20th century art]] in the Western world, many of which originally belonged to the surgeon [[William Anderson (collector)|William Anderson]] and diplomat [[Ernest Mason Satow]]\n\n'''East Asia'''\n*A large collection of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], (from c. 1500 BC onwards)\n*[[Huixian Bronze Hu]], an identical pair of bronze vessels from the [[Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou period]], China, (5th century BC)\n*Japanese antiquities from the [[Kofun period]] excavated by the pioneering archaeologist [[William Gowland]], (3rd\u20136th centuries AD)\n*The famous [[Admonitions Scroll]] by Chinese artist [[Gu Kaizhi]], (344\u2013406 AD)\n*The colossal [[Amit\u0101bha Buddha from Hancui]], China, (585 AD)\n*A set of ceramic [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], (c.728 AD)\n*[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], one from a set of eight surviving statues, China, (907\u20131125 AD)\n*A fine assemblage of Buddhist paintings from [[Dunhuang]], western China, collected by the British-Hungarian explorer [[Aurel Stein]], (5th\u201311th centuries AD)\n*[[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art|Pericival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics, (10th\u201318th centuries AD)\n*Ivory stand in the form of a seated lion, Chos-'khor-yan-rtse monastery in [[Tibet]], (13th century AD)\n*Pair of ceramic [[Kakiemon elephants]] from Japan, (17th century AD)\n*Japanese prints including [[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]], (1829\u201332)\n\n'''South Asia'''\n*Excavated objects from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] sites of [[Mohenjo-daro]], and [[Harappa]], [[Ancient India]] (now in [[Pakistan]]), (2500\u20132000 BC)\n*Sandstone fragment of a [[Pillars of Ashoka|Pillar of Ashoka]] with [[Brahmi]] inscription from [[Meerut]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]], (238 BC)\n*The [[Kulu Vase]] found near a monastery in [[Himachal Pradesh]], one of the earliest examples of figurative art from the sub-continent, northern India, (1st century BC)\n*[[Taxila copper plate|Copper plate]] from [[Taxila]], with important Kharoshthi inscription, [[Ancient India]](now in [[Pakistan]]), (1st century BC \u2013 1st century AD)\n*Indo-Scythian sandstone [[Mathura lion capital|Mathura Lion Capital]] and [[Sanchi Yakshi Figure|Bracket figure]] from one of the gateways to the Great Stupa at [[Sanchi]], central India, (1st century AD)\n*[[Bimaran casket|Bimaran Casket]] and [[Wardak Vase]], reliquaries from ancient stupas in Afghanistan, (1st\u20132nd centuries AD)\n*Relic deposits from the stupas at [[Manikyala]], [[Ahin Posh]], [[Sanchi]] and [[Gudivada]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*[[Seated Buddha from Gandhara]], and other Gandhara objects from [[Kafir Kot]], [[Jamal Garhi]] and [[Takht-i-Bahi]], [[Pakistan]], (1st\u20133rd centuries AD)\n*The [[Buddhapad Hoard]] of bronze images from southern India, (6th\u20138th centuries AD)\n*Stone statue of Buddha from the [[Sultanganj Buddha|Sultanganj]] hoard, Bihar, eastern India.

Over 350,000 objects<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania_and_americas.aspx |title=Africa, Oceania and the Americas |publisher=British Museum |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> spanning thousands of years tells the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by [[Henry Christy]], [[Harry Geoffrey Beasley|Harry Beasley]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman|William Oldman]] are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays [[ethnographic]] from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on [[North America]] and [[Mexico]]. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.\n\n'''Africa'''\n[[File:African_throwing_knives.jpg|thumb|left|Room 25 \u2013 Collection of African [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]]]]\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir [[Henry Wellcome]], which was donated by the [[Wellcome Collection|Wellcome Historical Medical Museum]] in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at [[Senegambian stone circles|megalithic circles]] in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite [[Kongo ivories#Afro-Portuguese ivories|Afro-Portuguese ivories]], a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in west Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]] and [[Igbo-Ukwu]] bronze sculptures, the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from [[Ife]], a similar [[terracotta]] head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an [[Ikom monoliths|Ikom monolith]] from [[Cross River State]], the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the [[Kuba Kingdom]] including three [[Ndop (Kuba)|royal figures]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from [[Gondar]] and [[Amba Mariam|Magdala]], Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] (that includes a unique soapstone, [[anthropomorphic]] figure) and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the [[Venda]] peoples and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].\n\n'''Oceania'''\n\nThe British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] \u2013 Aboriginal art from [[Australia]] is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped [[pestle]] and a group of stone [[Pestle and mortar|mortars]] from [[Papua New Guinea]]. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir [[George Grey]], Sir [[Frederick Broome]] and [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Gordon]], before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. A poignant artefact is the wooden [[Gweagal#The_Gweagal_Spears_and_Shield|shield]] found near [[Botany Bay]] during Cook's first voyage in 1770. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering [[anthropology|anthropologists]] such as [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] and [[Katherine Routledge]].\n\nIn addition, the [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and [[Hei-tiki|jade objects]] and the [[Aboriginal art]] collection is distinguished by its wide range of [[bark paintings]], including two very early bark etchings collected by [[John Hunter Kerr]]. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[statue of A'a from Rurutu]] Island, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|deity figure]].  Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of [[K\u016b|K\u016b-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].\n\n'''Americas'''\nThe Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Moche culture|Moche]], [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia.

The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. The Department of Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/research_publications_series/2011/the_future_of_UK_numismatics.aspx ''The British Museum and the Future of UK Numismatics.

[[Conservation (cultural heritage)|Conservation]] has six specialist areas: ceramics & glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/science/index.html|title=British Museum \u2013 Conservation and Scientific Research|work=thebritishmuseum.ac.uk}}</ref> has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.\n\n===Libraries and archives===\nThis department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The [[Anthropology]] Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes.<ref>See the \"Facilities and Services\" tab on the home page for each department for details on each library; not all are kept at Bloomsbury.

Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece were also claimed by UNESCO among others for restitution.

[[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup when the team qualified for the 1938 tournament after its opponent, [[Japan national football team|Japan]], withdrew from the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification#Group12|qualification]] heats. The 6\u20130 loss to eventual finalists [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the first round of the tournament in [[Reims]], France, remains the nation's only appearance in the World Cup. The straight knock-out format used at the time made it the only game ever played by the Indonesians. Thus, Indonesia holds the World Cup record as the team with the fewest matches played (1) and one of the teams with the fewest goals scored (0). They were 15th place in the rankings.\n\n===1950: India's withdrawal ===\n[[Myanmar national football team|Burma]], [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] withdrew before the draw, so [[India national football team|India]] qualified automatically. India later also withdrew because of the expense of traveling (or, according to some reports, after a FIFA ruling that players were not allowed to play barefoot). Other teams economized by sailing, rather than flying, to the tournament. FIFA decided not to invite another team, leaving the World Cup three teams short.\n\n===1954: South Korea's first World Cup ===\nIn the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification]], the Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. In the 1954 World Cup qualification, three countries from the AFC participated. [[China national football team|China PR]] withdrew, [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] won against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and for the first time qualified for the World Cup. South Korea lost twice 0\u20139 to Hungary and 0\u20137 to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. They were 16th place in the rankings.\n\n===1958\u20131962: World Cup without Asia ===\nAt the 1958 World Cup qualification, FIFA rejected South Korea's entry. Qualifications were held with Africa, Turkey, [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and China PR withdrew in the first qualification round, Indonesia and [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in second. [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]] withdrew in the final qualification round as they refused to play against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] for political reasons. Israel technically would have qualified automatically, but before the qualification rounds began, FIFA ruled that no team would qualify without playing at least one match (except for the defending champions and the hosts), and Israel had yet to play any. A special play-off was created between Israel and the runner-up of one of the UEFA Groups, where the teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis, with the winner qualifying. After [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] refused, [[Wales national football team|Wales]], the runner-up of UEFA Group 4, was the team drawn from the UEFA group runners-up. Israel lost both times 0\u20132 and did not reach the World Cup.\n\nThere was only one round of play at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. The three teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winner would advance to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. Indonesia withdrew. South Korea won twice against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and advanced to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. South Korea lost both times against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and did not reach the World Cup.\n\n===1966: North Korea's impressive performance ===\nAFC, CAF, OFC confederations competed together in the qualification rounds. After having no teams from Africa or Asia qualifying for the previous two World Cups, FIFA decided to allocate a single spot to the winner of a four-way play-off between the winners of three African groups and the winner of the Asian zone. [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] was suspended by FIFA due to [[apartheid]]. All 15 remaining African teams withdrew in protest against there being no automatic qualification for an African team, leaving the AFC\u2013OFC winner to qualify by default. [[Japan national football team|Japan]] then withdrew because the three-team tournament was moved from Japan to [[Cambodia]], leaving only [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] to contest the final place. Because North Korea lacked diplomatic relations with most countries, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult, until Head of State [[Norodom Sihanouk]], an ally of [[Kim Il-sung]], agreed to hosting the matches in [[Phnom Penh]]. North Korea easily won both legs to qualify. North Korea qualified for the eighth FIFA World Cup held in England.\n\nNorth Korea got to Group 4. North Korea predictably lost the first game against the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]] by 0\u20133, the second was 1\u20131 against [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. However, in an upset [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 1-0 at [[Ayresome Park]], [[Middlesbrough]], and finished above them, thus earning qualification to the next round along with the USSR. This was the first time that a nation from outside Europe or the Americas had progressed from the first stage of a World Cup. In their match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], they lead 3\u20130 after only 22 minutes. Portugal's [[Eus\u00e9bio]] changed the pace, scoring four goals in the game and [[Jos\u00e9 Augusto de Almeida|Jos\u00e9 Augusto]] added a fifth in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5\u20133 win. In a 1999 documentary featuring interviews with surviving members of the team, they describe themselves as having been welcomed home as national heroes.\n\n===1970: Israel debut at the World Cup ===\nThe 1970 AFC and OFC FIFA World Cup qualification were held together. Israel, [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and [[Zimbabwe national football team|Rhodesia]] received byes and advanced to the second round directly. The remaining three teams, [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], Japan and South Korea, played against each other twice in South Korea. Australia advanced to the second round Group 1 and won over Rhodesia and advanced to the final round. In Group 2, Israel advanced to the final round when they defeated New Zealand twice. North Korea, despite their good performance in the previous tournament staged in England in 1966, refused to play in Israel and withdrew. In the final round, Israel defeated Australia 2\u20131 on aggregate and reached the World Cup. Israel qualified for their only World Cup to date as an Asian team. Soon after this, however, they left the Asian Football Confederation, and now compete in the European zone as they are now a member of UEFA. As of 2018, this is Israel's only World Cup finals appearance.\n\nIsrael lost their first game 0\u20132 against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], the other ended in a 1\u20131 draw against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and 0\u20130 with Italy. Israel ranked last in the group and did not advance in the tournament. The team finished 13th out of 16 teams.\n\n===1974: Another World Cup without Asian nations ===\nThe Asian and Oceania zone competed for one place in the World Cup. India, [[Sri Lanka national football team|Sri Lanka]] and the Philippines withdrew before the matches were played. The remaining 15 teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical and political considerations. Zone A had 7 teams (teams from East Asia, plus Israel). All matches were played in the Republic of Korea. Zone B had 8 teams (teams from West Asia and Oceania, plus Indonesia and North Korea). South Korea won Zone A and Australia Zone B. In the final round, South Korea and Australia were tied 2\u20132 on aggregate, and a play-off on neutral ground in Hong Kong was played to decide the qualifier. Australia won this match through a [[Jimmy Mackay]] goal, scored off a free kick.\n\n===1978: Iran's debut ===\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams and Israel entered the competition. However, [[South Vietnam national football team|South Vietnam]] could not compete after being annexed by [[Vietnam]]. The Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. The 21 teams would be divided into 5 groups. Sri Lanka, North Korea, [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] and the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] withdrew. [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]], South Korea, [[Iran national football team|Iran]], [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] and Australia won in their group. Iran won the final group and  qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time.\n\nThe group consisted of Iran, [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Iran, the reigning Asian champion, went out of the tournament winless. Iran lost two of their three group stage games: 0\u20133 against the Netherlands and 1\u20134 against Peru. However, they managed to draw 1\u20131 against Scotland with a late [[Iraj Danaeifard]] goal. The team finished 14th out of the 16 teams.\n\n===1982: Kuwait's debut ===\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams entered the qualification. Iran withdrew before the draw was made. The Asian and Oceania zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The remaining 20 teams would be divided into four groups. New Zealand, [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], Kuwait and China PR advanced to the Final Round. In the Final Round, Kuwait ranked first place and immediately qualified to the World Cup. China PR and New Zealand finished level on points and goal difference, and a play-off on neutral ground ([[Singapore]]) was played to decide the qualifier. Kuwait won 2\u20131 and  qualified to the World Cup for the first time.\n\nKuwait's group consisted of [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[England national football team|England]] and [[France national football team|France]]. In the opening match, Kuwait held Czechoslovakia to a 1\u20131 draw. In the game between Kuwait and France, with France leading 3\u20131, France midfielder [[Alain Giresse]] scored a goal vehemently contested by the Kuwait team, who had stopped play after hearing a piercing whistle from the stands, which they thought had come from Soviet referee [[Miroslav Stupar]]. Play had not yet resumed when Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch to remonstrate with the referee. Stupar countermanded his initial decision and disallowed the goal to the fury of the French. [[Maxime Bossis]] scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4\u20131. Kuwait lost the third game 0\u20131 against England. Kuwait finished fourth in their group and 21st out of the 24 teams.\n\n===1986: Iraq's debut, South Korea's return ===\nA total of 27 AFC teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. Teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical considerations. Zone A had 13 teams (teams from West Asia) and Zone B had 14 teams (teams from East Asia). [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]], [[Oman national football team|Oman]] withdrew. Iran were disqualified. Iraq won Zone A Final Round, South Korea won Zone B. Iraq and South Korea qualified for the 1986 World Cup.\n\nAs of 2018, this was the last time Iraq qualified for the finals. Iraq lost all three games: 0\u20131 against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], 1\u20132 against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and 0\u20131 against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], and finished 23 out of the 24 teams. However the defeat to Paraguay was controversial, as Iraq's [[Ahmed Radhi]] had scored a header from a corner right at the end of the first half which the referee disallowed as he incorrectly blew the whistle for half-time just before the header went into the back of the net.<ref>[http://www.linguasport.com/futbol/internacional/mundial/1986_MEXICO_FS.htm LinguaSport - 1986 World Cup]</ref> The defeat to Belgium was also controversial as the referee gave a yellow card to Iraq's [[Basil Gorgis]] in a case of mistaken identity (the yellow was supposed to be given to [[Ghanim Oraibi]]) while the score was 0\u20132. Gorgis sarcastically applauded the referee's incorrect decision which led to him getting sent off and Iraq lost 1\u20132.<ref>[https://ahdaaf.me/2017/02/28/mexico-86-iraqs-world-cup-campaign-where-luck-met-fate-part-three/ MEXICO 86: IRAQ\u2019S WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN, WHERE LUCK MET FATE (PART THREE)]</ref> South Korea qualified for the first time since 1954. In its first game, South Korea lost 1\u20133 against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], in the second game drew [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 1\u20131 in a downpour and in the third lost 2\u20133 against Italy. South Korea finished 20 out of the 24 teams.\n\n===1990: United Arab Emirates first World Cup ===\nTwenty-six teams were in the running for these spots; [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]], India, [[Maldives national football team|Maldives]] and [[South Yemen national football team|South Yemen]] withdrew without playing a qualifying match. The Maldives withdrew before the final draw, leaving 25 teams to be divided into six groups of four or five teams each. South Korea, United Arab Emirates, [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]], China PR, Saudi Arabia and North Korea advanced to the Final Round. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates qualified for the 1990 World Cup, taking the first two places.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time, its only appearance to date, but lost all three of its games: 2\u20130 to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], 5\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and 4\u20131 to Yugoslavia. All three of the UAE's first round opponents reached the last 16. They were 24th (and last) place in the rankings. South Korea also lost all its three games: 0\u20132 to Belgium, 1\u20133 to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and 0\u20131 to Uruguay, and finished 22 out of 24 teams.\n\n===1994: Saudi Arabia reaches the Round of 16===\nA total of 30 teams entered the qualification. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The 30 teams were divided into six groups of five teams each, although Myanmar and [[Nepal national football team|Nepal]] withdrew after playing no match. The teams would play against each other twice. The group winners would advance to the Final Round. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Japan advanced to the Final Round, with Saudi Arabia and South Korea taking the first two places in the World Cup.\n\nSaudi Arabia qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time. Their group consisted of Belgium, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Saudi Arabia lost its first game 1\u20132 against Netherlands, although they scored the first goal. Later, they beat Morocco 2\u20131. Against Belgium, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairian ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game's only goal. Both teams went through. For the much-fancied Dutch, however, progression to the second round was a somewhat nervier experience. Netherlands won the group, Saudi Arabia finished second and Belgium qualified as one of the best third-placed teams. In the first knockout stage match, Saudi Arabia faced Sweden and lost 1\u20133 after two goals from [[Kennet Andersson]] and one from [[Martin Dahlin]]. They were 12th place in the rankings.\n\nSouth Korea's World Cup began with two draws against Spain (2\u20132) and [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (0\u20130). However they lost the decisive match 2\u20133 against title holders Germany. They were 20th place in the rankings.\n\n===1998: Four Asian nations at the World Cup===\nA total of 36 teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated 3.5 places (out of 32) in the final tournament. Iran, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea qualified for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]]. Japan qualified for the first time.\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi Arabia were placed in Group C alongside South Africa, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and hosts France. Saudi Arabia started with a 1\u20130 defeat by Denmark. Next, France scored four to eliminate Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia (0\u20132\u20130), which again failed to show any resemblance to the 1994 team that reached the second round, played most of the game with ten men after defender [[Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi]] was given a direct red card in the 19th minute for a poor tackle on [[Bixente Lizarazu]]. Forward [[Thierry Henry]] scored two goals, while [[David Trezeguet]] and Lizarazu scored one each for France. With two goals against Saudi Arabia, South Africa led but watched in horror as the Saudis scored on two penalty kicks to gain a 2\u20132 draw. The Saudis entered the match under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime assistant, after Brazilian [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] was fired following the 4\u20130 loss to France.\n\n====Japan====\nJapan lost all three of its matches in its debut. In the first, it fell 1\u20130 to Argentina, with [[Gabriel Batistuta]] scoring for the opponents, knocking the ball over the Japanese goalkeeper on the edge of the penalty area. In the second match, against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], a late [[Davor \u0160uker]] goal ensured a 1\u20130 Croatia victory and his nation's progression to the next round, simultaneously eliminating Japan from the tournament. Japan's World Cup campaign officially ended with an unexpected 2\u20131 defeat to rank outsiders [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. Two goals from [[Theodore Whitmore]] gave Jamaica their first ever win in the World Cup finals, although [[Masashi Nakayama]] had the honour of scoring Japan's first-ever goal at the World Cup finals, which came in the 74th minute.\n\n====Iran====\nIran's first game of Group F was played against Yugoslavia, a 1\u20130 loss instigated by a [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]] free-kick. Iran recorded their first World Cup victory in the second game, beating the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 2\u20131, with [[Hamid Estili]] and [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]] scoring goals for Iran. The Iran\u2013U.S. World Cup match was preheated with much excitement owing to each country's political stance after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. In an act of defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, however, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and took ceremonial pictures before the match kickoff. Following the defeat by Iran, the U.S. were eliminated from the World Cup. Iran played Germany in the third game, where they lost 2\u20130. German goals were scored from [[Oliver Bierhoff]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]]. The one win and two defeats left Iran third in the final group standings, not enough for progression to the next round.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea entered the 1998 World Cup without a single win to their name despite 14 World Cup games' experience. South Korea played Mexico, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the first game, South Korea lead in the 27th minute thanks to a [[Ha Seok-ju]] free-kick that was deflected into the Mexican goal. A couple of minutes after the goal was scored, however, Ha Seok-ju was sent off for a bad challenge from behind, and Mexico leveled the score through half-time substitute [[Ricardo Pel\u00e1ez]]. With approximately 15 minutes remaining, [[Luis Hern\u00e1ndez (footballer)|Luis Hern\u00e1ndez]] put Mexico in the lead with a simple tap-in. Hern\u00e1ndez then went on to complete the victory after scoring Mexico's third goal. South Korea had to wait four more years to record their first ever victory in a World Cup: its next game against the Netherlands was a heavy 0\u20135 defeat, the third-worst loss in the nation's World Cup history. Its third game was against Belgium. A big win would have given Belgium a chance of progressing and an early goal by [[Luc Nilis]] might have set them on the way. The Koreans, however, mounted stiff resistance and in the second half, and [[Yoo Sang-chul]] scored the equaliser in an eventual 1\u20131 draw.\n\n===2002: South Korea and Japan hosted the World Cup===\n[[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] were selected as hosts by [[FIFA]] on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and [[Mexico]] presented three rival bids. However, the two Asian countries agreed to unite their bids shortly before the decision was made, and they were chosen unanimously in preference to Mexico. This was the first (and so far the only) World Cup to be hosted by two countries. The [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] was the tournament's 17th staging. It was also the first World Cup held in Asia, and the last in which the [[golden goal]] rule was utilized. South Korea and Japan, the co-hosts, qualified automatically, leaving 2.5 spots open for competition between 40 teams. Myanmar withdrew from the tournament after being placed in Group 2 but before any matches had been played, therefore reducing the group to three teams. [[Afghanistan national football team|Afghanistan]], [[Bhutan national football team|Bhutan]], North Korea and [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] did not participate in the qualification process. Asia's two remaining automatic qualifying berths were taken by Saudi Arabia and China PR. Iran failed to become a third Asian representative in the World Cup after losing their AFC/UEFA playoff against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].\n\n====China PR====\nChina PR qualified for the finals for the first time. Coached by [[Bora Milutinovi\u0107]] (the fifth national team he coached in five consecutive World Cups), the nation failed to earn a point or even score a goal. As football is widely followed in [[China]], national team success is considered to be a source of national pride. Around 300 million people tuned into broadcasts of China's 2002 World Cup matches, with a staggering 170 million new television sets being bought by citizens in order to watch their nation's first World Cup appearance. Its first game was against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Costa Rica dealt China PR a harsh blow by taking the lead against the run of play on 61 minutes. [[R\u00f3nald G\u00f3mez]]'s slick backheel played [[Paulo Wanchope]] in, and [[Wu Chengying]]'s challenge only popped the ball up for G\u00f3mez to fire in a left-foot shot. China PR had no time to gather their thoughts before they were 2\u20130 down. China's PR best moment of the first-half came on 39 minutes when they broke quickly after fending off a Costa Rica free-kick. Its second game against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] was a 0\u20134 defeat. China PR looked lively and appeared to be enjoying themselves, even when they overhit the ball, but China PR could not do anything about [[Roberto Carlos]]'s left-footed free-kick goal in the 15th minute. [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] then scored two and [[Ronaldinho]] one to effectively end the match. China PR searched for their first goal of the tournament in their third match, against Turkey. After just ten minutes, however, they were already down 0\u20132. Just before the half-hour mark, China PR almost scored their first goal of the tournament when [[Yang Chen (footballer, born 1974)|Yang Chen]] hit the post. [[Hasan \u015ea\u015f]] again set up Turkey with a cross to the far post, this time for [[\u00dcmit Davala]] to score off the post. China PR failed to score a goal and was eliminated from the tournament.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea beat [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 2\u20130 after [[Hwang Sun-hong]] and Yoo Sang-chul scored. The first real chance for the home side came in the 20th minute, when Yoo Sang-chul shot across the face of an outstretched [[Jerzy Dudek]]. South Korea started to apply more pressure and took the lead in the 25th minute: [[Lee Eul-yong]] played the ball into Hwang Sun-hong, who hit the ball first-time into the net. In the 53rd minute, South Korea scored their second goal: Yoo Sang-chul ran towards [[Tomasz Wa\u0142doch]] and [[Rados\u0142aw Ka\u0142u\u017cny]], then confidently shot between them and past goalkeeper Dudek. Even the President of Korea waved his hat at the goal, which secured South Korea's first-ever win at the World Cup finals. In its second match, against the United States, the game's first real scoring chance fell to the U.S.' [[Clint Mathis]], who scored with a left-footed drive from the middle of the penalty area. Later on, in the 78th minute, an [[Ahn Jung-hwan]] glancing header completely stunned American goalkeeper [[Brad Friedel]], who seemed rooted to the spot as the ball sailed into the net. South Korea missed the chance to take all three points right at the end when [[Choi Yong-soo]] stabbed another shot over the bar, with only Friedel to beat. South Korea played its third match against Portugal, needing a win to be guaranteed a place in the second round, though earning one point would suffice (for the U.S. as well, however).\n\nThe South Koreans tore apart a Portuguese side who had [[Jo\u00e3o Vieira Pinto|Jo\u00e3o Pinto]] and [[Beto (Portuguese footballer, born 1976)|Beto]] sent off. In the 70th minute, [[Park Ji-sung]] smashed in a brilliant goal for Korea to secure a 1\u20130 victory and Korea's progression to the next round. Here, South Korea beat Italy 2\u20131 in sudden-death extra time. In the 18th minute, [[Christian Vieri]] headed Italy into the lead from a [[Francesco Totti]] corner. Ahn Jung-hwan had the best chance for Korea in the 36th minute when he shot over the bar from close range. Two minutes from time, the stadium erupted as Italy defender [[Christian Panucci]] failed to clear the ball, with [[Seol Ki-hyun]] pouncing on his mistake. Totti received his second yellow card for diving in the penalty area. Ten-men Italy finally fell to a 117th-minute, golden goal header scored by Ahn Jung-hwan, who at the time was ironically playing for Italian club [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]].\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Spain were unable to win a second consecutive penalty shootout, losing to South Korea after having two goals controversially disallowed in normal time, with South Korea becoming the first (and, as of 2018, the only) team from outside Europe and the Americas to reach the last four of a World Cup. Four minutes after the restart, a Spanish goal was disallowed, while a second Spanish goal was disallowed after the linesman judged that the ball had gone out of play before [[Fernando Morientes]] headed the ball into the net. In the 100th minute, Morientes turned on a long throw-in and crashed his shot against the left post. Korea won 5\u20133 on penalties and became the first ever Asian nation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, where they would face Germany.\n\nThe match started slowly: South Korea kept possession well and Germany appeared content to keep the volume of the crowd down, with both sides entering half-time level at 0\u20130. In the 75th minute, however, [[Michael Ballack]] ran on to [[Oliver Neuville]]'s low cross; his shot was blocked by goalkeeper [[Lee Woon-jae]], but Ballack followed up to convert the rebound and secure Germany's place in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] with a 1\u20130 victory. With the semi-final defeat, Korea contested the third-place match in [[Daegu]] against the other defeated semi-finalist, Turkey. Turkey, however, won third place after an entertaining 3\u20132 victory in a match that included the fastest ever World Cup goal, scored by [[S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] striker [[Hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr]] after just 11 seconds. Lee Eul-yong replied in the ninth minute with a curling free-kick into the top right-hand corner, but shortly after, [[\u0130lhan Mans\u0131z]] put Turkey back in front in the 13th minute after splitting the South Korean defence by playing a swift one-two with \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr. [[Song Chong-gug]] then managed to stun Turkey goalkeeper [[R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber]] when his long-range shot deflected off of [[Cha Du-ri]]'s bottom, in injury time, for a last consolation goal that ended the game on a slight high note for the home fans.\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi Arabia were eliminated as the worst team in tournament, after three defeats and no goals scored, including an 0\u20138 loss to Germany, 0\u20131 to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and 0\u20133 to the Republic of Ireland.\n\n====Japan====\nHosts Japan topped their group with two wins and one draw. In the first match, they drew 2\u20132 with Belgium. [[Marc Wilmots]] broke the deadlock with a beautiful overhead kick in the 57th minute. Two minutes later, Japan's [[Takayuki Suzuki]], in the penalty area, got a foot on to [[Shinji Ono]]'s pass from the half-way line. In the 67th minute, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Junichi Inamoto]] ran through three defenders to give Japan a 2\u20131 lead. Five minutes later, the stadium was momentarily silenced when [[Peter Van Der Heyden]], beating the offside trap on the edge of the area, neatly lobbed Japan goalkeeper [[Seigo Narazaki]] as he came off his line. Japan advanced to the second round with a 1\u20130 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and a 2\u20130 victory against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]. Japan register their first ever World Cup finals victory. However, they subsequently exited the tournament during the Round of 16 after a 1\u20130 defeat to Turkey. \u00dcmit Davala headed Turkey into the lead from an [[Erg\u00fcn Penbe]]'s corner in the 12th minute. An [[Alessandro Santos]] free-kick crashed against the woodwork later on to give the Japanese some hope for the second-half. Japan made a couple of substitutions at half-time as they looked for fresh initiative. [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] deflected shot almost troubled Turkish goalkeeper R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber. Japan continued to look for the equaliser, with [[Akinori Nishizawa]]'s header on target and [[Tomokazu Myojin]] shooting just narrowly wide. With ten minutes left in the game, Nishizawa's shot flew over the bar and with it Japan's hopes of a place in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2006: Iran returned to the World Cup ===\nForty-four Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]], Philippines, Bhutan and [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] decided not to take part, while [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] was banned from the competition, so a total of 39 teams took part to compete for 4.5 places in the World Cup. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan and Iran qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] finals.\n\n====Iran====\nIran started their campaign with high expectations from fans and media. Their first match was against Mexico in Group D. The game was level 1\u20131 at the half-time, but Iran lost at the end because of a defensive mistake, and the match finished 3\u20131, with goals scored by [[Omar Bravo]] and [[Zinha]] for Mexico and [[Yahya Golmohammadi]] for Iran. Iran then played Portugal in the second game, losing 2\u20130; goals were scored by [[Deco]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], the latter from a penalty. The two losses meant Iran was eliminated from the competition even before contesting their third and final game against [[Angola national football team|Angola]]. Iran drew 1\u20131, with [[Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh]] scoring the Iran goal.\n\n====Japan====\nJapan also failed to advance to the Round of 16 after finishing the group without a win, losing to Australia 1\u20133 in the first match. In the 26th minute, [[Shunsuke Nakamura]] scored the first goal, only for Australia to respond with three late goals in the 84th, 89th and 92nd minutes. In game two, Japan drew with Croatia 0\u20130. After defeats in the opening game, both Japan and Croatia seemed reluctant to take any early risks and for 20 minutes, little appeared to transpire. In the 21st minute, however, [[Niko Kranj\u010dar]] missed penalty, while five minutes into the second-half, the ball arrived at the far post only for [[Atsushi Yanagisawa]] to horrendously miss an open goal, skewing the ball back across the goalmouth. In Japan's third match, it lost to Brazil 1\u20134, despite scoring the game's first goal, in the 34th minute, from [[Keiji Tamada]].\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea won its first match 2\u20131, against [[Togo national football team|Togo]]; goals were scored by [[Lee Chun-soo]] and Ahn Jung-hwan. The victory marked Korea's their first World Cup finals win outside of home soil. In the second game, a 1\u20131 draw with France, Thierry Henry scored in the ninth minute, but Park Ji-sung leveled the score in 80th minute. Before the last match, against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Korea had a strong chance to reach the round of 16. Switzerland scored first from a [[Philippe Senderos]] headed a goal off a [[Hakan Yakin]] free-kick in the 23rd minute. France went ahead against Togo in the 55th minute, which would mean that if Switzerland were to win, South Korea would be eliminated. Switzerland's star striker, [[Alexander Frei]], doubled Switzerland's lead with 13 minutes to play while France won their match, resulting in South Korea's elimination from the competition.\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi Arabia drew the first match 2\u20132 with [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]; Saudi Arabia had the lead as late as the 93rd minute, but [[Radhi Jaidi]] leveled the score. The Saudis' next game was against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], a 0\u20134 defeat. Saudi Arabia knew before kick-off that they had to score at least four goals to stand a chance of qualifying, but survival was clearly priority number one as they allowed Spain, who had changed their entire first 11, to feel their way into the match. [[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]] scored at the 39th minute and buried their chances of progression beyond the group stage.\n\n===2010: South Korea and Japan reaches the Round of 16, North Korea's return ===\nForty-three teams competed for spots at the 2010 World Cup; [[Laos national football team|Laos]], [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] and the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] did not enter qualification. This was the first time Timor-Leste competed in World Cup qualification and the first time Australia attempted to qualify as a member of the AFC, having moved from the [[Oceania Football Confederation]] at the start of 2006. Asia's four automatic qualifying berths were taken by Australia, Japan]], North Korea and South Korea.\n\n====North Korea====\nNorth Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; they were drawn into [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]], and played their first match against five-time winners Brazil on 15 June. Brazil won 2\u20131 in a game where North Korea were well organised defensively and showed resilience, frustrating the Brazilians. Despite their best efforts, however, they were nevertheless outmatched and eventually broken down. [[Maicon Sisenando|Maicon]]'s relief was visible after his goal to finally put Brazil ahead. Their next game was against Portugal on 21 June, where they suffered a heavy 0\u20137 defeat. Despite starting well (much like against the Brazilians), with a defensive, well organised approach, once Portugal scored the first, the North Korean defense unfolded and the following six goals were scored with relative ease. In North Korea's last match, against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] on 25 June, the team fell 3\u20130. After losing all three matches in the group stages, North Korea were eliminated, finishing last in Group G.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea were drawn into Group B alongside Argentina, [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. South Korea registered the first win at the 2010 World Cup with a 2\u20130 victory over Greece, with goals scored by [[Lee Jung-soo]] and captain Park Ji-sung. In the second match, South Korea fell to Argentina 1\u20134, with striker [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] scoring a hat-trick and [[Park Chu-young]] scoring an own goal for the Argentines; [[Lee Chung-yong]] scored Korea's consolation goal. South Korea coach [[Huh Jung-moo]], who played against Argentina's [[Diego Maradona]] at the 1986 World Cup, saw his team struggle to live with Argentina's quick tempo and the quality of their pass-and-move football. The decisive match was with Nigeria, which ended 2\u20132 and with subsequent triumph for South Korea, because paired with Argentina's defeat of Greece, the draw sealed their first-ever progression beyond the group stage on foreign soil.\n\nAs Group B runners-up, South Korea faced Uruguay in the last 16. The South Koreans were effervescent in their attacking third but shaky in their defence, which was exposed as early as the eighth minute: [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] was fed on the left and played a low ball across the six-yard area, which was misjudged by goalkeeper [[Jung Sung-ryong]] and his statuesque defence but not by [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] at the far post, who calmly slotted in for his second goal of the competition. In the 68th minute, the South Koreans' luck change when, off of a free-kick, Bolton's Lee Chung-yong pounced on [[Mauricio Victorino]]'s attempted headed clearance to score a nod-in from eight yards out; it was the first goal Uruguay had conceded in the tournament. With ten minutes remaining, Su\u00e1rez lurked on the fringes of the 18-yard area as a corner was swung in from the right. He cut in from the left before curling in a well-struck shot that left goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong rooted as the ball clipped the post on its way in. The South Koreans pressed and should have taken the game into extra-time, but substitute [[Lee Dong-gook]]'s weak shot squirmed under the shirt of [[Fernando Muslera]] before it was comfortably cleared.\n\n====Australia====\nAustralia were drawn into [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]], which also featured three-time world champion Germany, [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]]. On 14 June, Australia faced Germany in [[Durban]]; [[Pim Verbeek]] surprisingly chose to play without a recognised striker. Australia were comprehensively defeated 4\u20130, and Verbeek was heavily criticised for his tactics,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/world-cup-2010/world-cup-news/verbeek-takes-blame-for-socceroos-defeat-20100614-y6gy.html|title=Verbeek takes blame for Socceroos defeat|work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=14 June 2010 | location=Sydney}}</ref> with chief SBS Football Analyst [[Craig Foster (Australian footballer)|Craig Foster]] calling for his immediate sacking.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/world-cup-2010/craig-foster-sack-pim-verbeek-immediately/story-fn4l4sip-1225880401600|title=Craig Foster \u2013 sack Pim Verbeek immediately|work=The Australian |date=16 June 2010|first=Tim|last=Hilferty}}</ref>\n\nAustralia's second group match, against Ghana, resulted in a 1\u20131 draw. Australia shot its only goal early in the first half by [[Brett Holman]] after Ghana's goalkeeper [[Richard Kingson]] fumbled the ball following a [[Mark Bresciano]] free-kick. Shortly after, a goal-bound strike from Ghana's [[Jonathan Mensah]] was blocked on the goal line by [[Harry Kewell]]'s upper arm, resulting in a penalty kick and a straight red card for Kewell. Ghanaian striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] scored the equalizing goal. Despite the man advantage, however, Ghana were mostly limited to long-range shots on Australia's goal, and some desperate defending from Australia saw the game finish a draw.\n\nIn their final group match, against Serbia, [[Tim Cahill]] was back from suspension and scored via a header in the second half to give Australia a 1\u20130 lead. Only four minutes later, Brett Holman doubled the scoreline with an impressive long-range effort. Late in the second half, Serbia managed to score a late goal through [[Marko Panteli\u0107]] after Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] fumbled the ball, with the game ultimately ending at 2\u20131. Germany had defeated Ghana 1\u20130, which meant that both Australia and Ghana finished on four points. Ghana, however, progressed to the knockout stage due to their superior goal difference. Verbeek completed his term as Australian coach at the end of the 2010 World Cup.\n\n====Japan====\nJapan hung on to win their first-ever World Cup match on foreign soil, defeating Cameroon 1\u20130. The game's only goal came in the 39th minute when [[Keisuke Honda]] controlled a cross at the far post and stabbed the ball past goalkeeper [[Souleymanou Hamidou]]. In the second game, Japan lost 0\u20131 to the Netherlands. [[Wesley Sneijder]]'s powerful 52nd-minute winner from just outside the box settled a fascinating Group E contest between two contrasting sides who opened up in the second half and were creating good chances right up to the final whistle. Loitering just outside the penalty area, Sneijder lashed a powerful right-foot shot towards goal that goalkeeper [[Eiji Kawashima]] could only deflect into the net despite being well-placed to make the save. Japan had the best chance to level the score one minute from time, but unmarked substitute [[Shinji Okazaki]] fired over the net from ten yards out.\n\nJapan's third, decisive match was against Denmark. Midfielder [[Keisuke Honda]] opened the scoreline, bending a 30-yard free-kick past Danish goalkeeper [[Thomas S\u00f8rensen]] in the 17th minute. Just 13 minutes later, teammate [[Yasuhito End\u014d]] fired past S\u00f8rensen's outstretched hand to make it 2\u20130 for Japan. [[Takeshi Okada]]'s side had to survive a late scare as [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]] tapped in a rebound after goalkeeper Kawashima saved the Dane's penalty kick. However, substitute Shinji Okazaki's 88th-minute strike clinched second place in the group for Japan with a 3\u20131 victory.\n\nJapan faced [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the last 16. The match was decided by a penalty shootout after the score was locked at 0\u20130 for 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shootout and progressed to its first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay itself maintained a solid defence. The first-half produced the occasional chance on goal, with [[Lucas Barrios]] having a shot saved shortly before a long-distance shot from [[Daisuke Matsui]] hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with both sides producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of outright dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A penalty shootout ensued, during which [[Yuichi Komano]] missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of its penalties, clinching the win and subsequent progression to the quarter-finals.\n\n===2014: Disappointment for Asians===\nThe [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], held in Brazil, marked the first time since 1990 where no Asian team managed to win a game, and where the AFC was the only FIFA confederation without both wins and teams represented in the knockout stages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sports.ndtv.com/fifa-world-cup-2014/features/226147-with-south-korea-s-loss-asia-out-of-world-cup |title=With South Korea's Loss, Asia Out of World Cup |access-date=2014-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805133218/http://sports.ndtv.com/fifa-world-cup-2014/features/226147-with-south-korea-s-loss-asia-out-of-world-cup |archive-date=2014-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-news-2014/asian-teams-struggle-at-world-cup-showcases-problems-at-home-20140624-zsjhk.html Asian teams' struggle at World Cup showcases problems at home]</ref> Three of Asia's four qualifiers in 2010\u2014Australia, Japan and South Korea\u2014qualified for the 2014 tournament. Iran, meanwhile, qualified for the first time since 2006.\n\nAustralia was eliminated early despite good performances against Chile and the Netherlands that both ended in close losses (1\u20133 and 2\u20133 respectively). In their third match, however, they were blown-out 3\u20130 to defending World Cup champions Spain, who were themselves also mathematically eliminated from the tournament.\n\nJapan opened the scoring in its first match against the Ivory Coast, but lost the lead en route to an eventual 1\u20132 defeat. In the following games, the Japanese failed to break Greece's tight defence and finished in a goalless draw, and afterwards, despite equalizing [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] at half-time, eventually lost 4\u20131 to ensure an early tournament exit.\n\nSouth Korea opened the score against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] after a blunder by goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]], but wound up conceding the equalizing goal shortly after. A high-scoring match with [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] had the Koreans defeated 4\u20132, and a 1\u20130 loss to Belgium ended Korea's campaign.\n\nAfter an opening 0\u20130 draw with Nigeria, the Iranian defense held Argentina goalless for most of the match before a [[Lionel Messi]] goal in injury time. Needing to beat the already-eliminated [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to clinch the group's second spot in the knockout stages, Iran wound up defeated 3\u20131.\n\n===2018:  Five Asian teams at FIFA World Cup===\nThe [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], held in Russia, marked the first time five Asian teams qualified for the FIFA World Cup finals 2018 in Russia. Only Japan advanced past the group stage, a feat aided by fair-play points in tie-breaking, at the expense of [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]]. Aside from Australia, who only got a draw and two defeats, the other three had at least one win: Saudi Arabia got a 2-1 comeback over [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], Iran defeated [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], and in the biggest upset, South Korea beat the defending champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]].<ref>[http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/world-cup/907483/asian-teams-2018-world-cup-graded/ Asian teams at the 2018 World Cup graded]</ref> In the round of 16, Japan surprised a favored [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and got a 2-0 lead, only to suffer a 3-2 comeback, with the 2 goals scored by Belgium from [[Jan Vertonghen]] and [[Marouane Fellaini]] The match ended with a Belgian goal by [[Nacer Chadli]] in the last minute of stoppage time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belgium dig deep to edge out Japan |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/match/300331551/#match-summary |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2 July 2018}}</ref>.South Koreans were out from group stage in this World Cup but a beating Germany's still big achievement for Korea,Asian(Specially,Korea Rep eliminated Germany)...\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/fwc_prel_history_by_year_25982.pdf FIFA Fact Sheet: History of the FIFA World Cup (TM) Preliminary Competition (by year)] (44 page PDF document)\n\n{{FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Countries at the FIFA World Cup}}\n\n[[Category:Countries at the FIFA World Cup| ]]\n[[Category:Association football in Asia]]\n[[Category:FIFA World Cup records and statistics]]\n", "text_old": "[[Association football]] is the most popular sport in nearly every countries of Asia,and 12 members of the [[Asian Football Confederation]](The AFC)have competed at the sport's biggest event,the men's [[FIFA World Cup]].

[[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA World Cup when the team qualified for the 1938 tournament after its opponent, [[Japan national football team|Japan]], withdrew from the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification#Group12|qualification]] heats. The 6\u20130 loss to eventual finalists [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the first round of the tournament in [[Reims]], France, remains the nation's only appearance in the World Cup. The straight knock-out format used at the time made it the only game ever played by the Indonesians. Thus, Indonesia holds the World Cup record as the team with the fewest matches played (1) and one of the teams with the fewest goals scored (0). They were 15th place in the rankings.\n\n===1950: India's withdrawal ===\n[[Myanmar national football team|Burma]], [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] withdrew before the draw, so [[India national football team|India]] qualified automatically. India later also withdrew because of the expense of traveling (or, according to some reports, after a FIFA ruling that players were not allowed to play barefoot). Other teams economized by sailing, rather than flying, to the tournament. FIFA decided not to invite another team, leaving the World Cup three teams short.\n\n===1954: South Korea's first World Cup ===\nIn the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification]], the Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. In the 1954 World Cup qualification, three countries from the AFC participated. [[China national football team|China PR]] withdrew, [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] won against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and for the first time qualified for the World Cup. South Korea lost twice 0\u20139 to Hungary and 0\u20137 to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. They were 16th place in the rankings.\n\n===1958\u20131962: World Cup without Asia ===\nAt the 1958 World Cup qualification, FIFA rejected South Korea's entry. Qualifications were held with Africa, Turkey, [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and China PR withdrew in the first qualification round, Indonesia and [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in second. [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]] withdrew in the final qualification round as they refused to play against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] for political reasons. Israel technically would have qualified automatically, but before the qualification rounds began, FIFA ruled that no team would qualify without playing at least one match (except for the defending champions and the hosts), and Israel had yet to play any. A special play-off was created between Israel and the runner-up of one of the UEFA Groups, where the teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis, with the winner qualifying. After [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] refused, [[Wales national football team|Wales]], the runner-up of UEFA Group 4, was the team drawn from the UEFA group runners-up. Israel lost both times 0\u20132 and did not reach the World Cup.\n\nThere was only one round of play at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. The three teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winner would advance to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. Indonesia withdrew. South Korea won twice against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and advanced to the UEFA/AFC Intercontinental play-off. South Korea lost both times against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and did not reach the World Cup.\n\n===1966: North Korea's impressive performance ===\nAFC, CAF, OFC confederations competed together in the qualification rounds. After having no teams from Africa or Asia qualifying for the previous two World Cups, FIFA decided to allocate a single spot to the winner of a four-way play-off between the winners of three African groups and the winner of the Asian zone. [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] was suspended by FIFA due to [[apartheid]]. All 15 remaining African teams withdrew in protest against there being no automatic qualification for an African team, leaving the AFC\u2013OFC winner to qualify by default. [[Japan national football team|Japan]] then withdrew because the three-team tournament was moved from Japan to [[Cambodia]], leaving only [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] to contest the final place. Because North Korea lacked diplomatic relations with most countries, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult, until Head of State [[Norodom Sihanouk]], an ally of [[Kim Il-sung]], agreed to hosting the matches in [[Phnom Penh]]. North Korea easily won both legs to qualify. North Korea qualified for the eighth FIFA World Cup held in England.\n\nNorth Korea got to Group 4. North Korea predictably lost the first game against the [[Soviet Union national football team|USSR]] by 0\u20133, the second was 1\u20131 against [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. However, in an upset [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 1-0 at [[Ayresome Park]], [[Middlesbrough]], and finished above them, thus earning qualification to the next round along with the USSR. This was the first time that a nation from outside Europe or the Americas had progressed from the first stage of a World Cup. In their match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], they lead 3\u20130 after only 22 minutes. Portugal's [[Eus\u00e9bio]] changed the pace, scoring four goals in the game and [[Jos\u00e9 Augusto de Almeida|Jos\u00e9 Augusto]] added a fifth in the 78th minute to earn Portugal a 5\u20133 win. In a 1999 documentary featuring interviews with surviving members of the team, they describe themselves as having been welcomed home as national heroes.\n\n===1970: Israel debut at the World Cup ===\nThe 1970 AFC and OFC FIFA World Cup qualification were held together. Israel, [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and [[Zimbabwe national football team|Rhodesia]] received byes and advanced to the second round directly. The remaining three teams, [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], Japan and South Korea, played against each other twice in South Korea. Australia advanced to the second round Group 1 and won over Rhodesia and advanced to the final round. In Group 2, Israel advanced to the final round when they defeated New Zealand twice. North Korea, despite their good performance in the previous tournament staged in England in 1966, refused to play in Israel and withdrew. In the final round, Israel defeated Australia 2\u20131 on aggregate and reached the World Cup. Israel qualified for their only World Cup to date as an Asian team. Soon after this, however, they left the Asian Football Confederation, and now compete in the European zone as they are now a member of UEFA. As of 2018, this is Israel's only World Cup finals appearance.\n\nIsrael lost their first game 0\u20132 against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], the other ended in a 1\u20131 draw against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and 0\u20130 with Italy. Israel ranked last in the group and did not advance in the tournament. The team finished 13th out of 16 teams.\n\n===1974: Another World Cup without Asian nations ===\nThe Asian and Oceania zone competed for one place in the World Cup. India, [[Sri Lanka national football team|Sri Lanka]] and the Philippines withdrew before the matches were played. The remaining 15 teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical and political considerations. Zone A had 7 teams (teams from East Asia, plus Israel). All matches were played in the Republic of Korea. Zone B had 8 teams (teams from West Asia and Oceania, plus Indonesia and North Korea). South Korea won Zone A and Australia Zone B. In the final round, South Korea and Australia were tied 2\u20132 on aggregate, and a play-off on neutral ground in Hong Kong was played to decide the qualifier. Australia won this match through a [[Jimmy Mackay]] goal, scored off a free kick.\n\n===1978: Iran's debut ===\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams and Israel entered the competition. However, [[South Vietnam national football team|South Vietnam]] could not compete after being annexed by [[Vietnam]]. The Asian zone was allocated one place (out of 16) in the final tournament. The 21 teams would be divided into 5 groups. Sri Lanka, North Korea, [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] and the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] withdrew. [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]], South Korea, [[Iran national football team|Iran]], [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] and Australia won in their group. Iran won the final group and  qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time.\n\nThe group consisted of Iran, [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Iran, the reigning Asian champion, went out of the tournament winless. Iran lost two of their three group stage games: 0\u20133 against the Netherlands and 1\u20134 against Peru. However, they managed to draw 1\u20131 against Scotland with a late [[Iraj Danaeifard]] goal. The team finished 14th out of the 16 teams.\n\n===1982: Kuwait's debut ===\nA total of 21 AFC and OFC teams entered the qualification. Iran withdrew before the draw was made. The Asian and Oceania zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The remaining 20 teams would be divided into four groups. New Zealand, [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], Kuwait and China PR advanced to the Final Round. In the Final Round, Kuwait ranked first place and immediately qualified to the World Cup. China PR and New Zealand finished level on points and goal difference, and a play-off on neutral ground ([[Singapore]]) was played to decide the qualifier. Kuwait won 2\u20131 and  qualified to the World Cup for the first time.\n\nKuwait's group consisted of [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[England national football team|England]] and [[France national football team|France]]. In the opening match, Kuwait held Czechoslovakia to a 1\u20131 draw. In the game between Kuwait and France, with France leading 3\u20131, France midfielder [[Alain Giresse]] scored a goal vehemently contested by the Kuwait team, who had stopped play after hearing a piercing whistle from the stands, which they thought had come from Soviet referee [[Miroslav Stupar]]. Play had not yet resumed when Sheikh Fahid Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, brother of the Kuwaiti Emir and president of the Kuwaiti Football Association, rushed onto the pitch to remonstrate with the referee. Stupar countermanded his initial decision and disallowed the goal to the fury of the French. [[Maxime Bossis]] scored another valid goal a few minutes later and France won 4\u20131. Kuwait lost the third game 0\u20131 against England. Kuwait finished fourth in their group and 21st out of the 24 teams.\n\n===1986: Iraq's debut, South Korea's return ===\nA total of 27 AFC teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. Teams were divided into two zones, based on geographical considerations. Zone A had 13 teams (teams from West Asia) and Zone B had 14 teams (teams from East Asia). [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]], [[Oman national football team|Oman]] withdrew. Iran were disqualified. Iraq won Zone A Final Round, South Korea won Zone B. Iraq and South Korea qualified for the 1986 World Cup.\n\nAs of 2018, this was the last time Iraq qualified for the finals. Iraq lost all three games: 0\u20131 against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], 1\u20132 against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and 0\u20131 against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], and finished 23 out of the 24 teams. However the defeat to Paraguay was controversial, as Iraq's [[Ahmed Radhi]] had scored a header from a corner right at the end of the first half which the referee disallowed as he incorrectly blew the whistle for half-time just before the header went into the back of the net.<ref>[http://www.linguasport.com/futbol/internacional/mundial/1986_MEXICO_FS.htm LinguaSport - 1986 World Cup]</ref> The defeat to Belgium was also controversial as the referee gave a yellow card to Iraq's [[Basil Gorgis]] in a case of mistaken identity (the yellow was supposed to be given to [[Ghanim Oraibi]]) while the score was 0\u20132. Gorgis sarcastically applauded the referee's incorrect decision which led to him getting sent off and Iraq lost 1\u20132.<ref>[https://ahdaaf.me/2017/02/28/mexico-86-iraqs-world-cup-campaign-where-luck-met-fate-part-three/ MEXICO 86: IRAQ\u2019S WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN, WHERE LUCK MET FATE (PART THREE)]</ref> South Korea qualified for the first time since 1954. In its first game, South Korea lost 1\u20133 against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], in the second game drew [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 1\u20131 in a downpour and in the third lost 2\u20133 against Italy. South Korea finished 20 out of the 24 teams.\n\n===1990: United Arab Emirates first World Cup ===\nTwenty-six teams were in the running for these spots; [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]], India, [[Maldives national football team|Maldives]] and [[South Yemen national football team|South Yemen]] withdrew without playing a qualifying match. The Maldives withdrew before the final draw, leaving 25 teams to be divided into six groups of four or five teams each. South Korea, United Arab Emirates, [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]], China PR, Saudi Arabia and North Korea advanced to the Final Round. South Korea and the United Arab Emirates qualified for the 1990 World Cup, taking the first two places.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first time, its only appearance to date, but lost all three of its games: 2\u20130 to [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], 5\u20131 to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] and 4\u20131 to Yugoslavia. All three of the UAE's first round opponents reached the last 16. They were 24th (and last) place in the rankings. South Korea also lost all its three games: 0\u20132 to Belgium, 1\u20133 to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and 0\u20131 to Uruguay, and finished 22 out of 24 teams.\n\n===1994: Saudi Arabia reaches the Round of 16===\nA total of 30 teams entered the qualification. The Asian zone was allocated two places (out of 24) in the final tournament. The 30 teams were divided into six groups of five teams each, although Myanmar and [[Nepal national football team|Nepal]] withdrew after playing no match. The teams would play against each other twice. The group winners would advance to the Final Round. Iraq, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Japan advanced to the Final Round, with Saudi Arabia and South Korea taking the first two places in the World Cup.\n\nSaudi Arabia qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time. Their group consisted of Belgium, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Saudi Arabia lost its first game 1\u20132 against Netherlands, although they scored the first goal. Later, they beat Morocco 2\u20131. Against Belgium, Saudi player Saaed Al-Owairian ran from his own half through a maze of Belgian players to score the game's only goal. Both teams went through. For the much-fancied Dutch, however, progression to the second round was a somewhat nervier experience. Netherlands won the group, Saudi Arabia finished second and Belgium qualified as one of the best third-placed teams. In the first knockout stage match, Saudi Arabia faced Sweden and lost 1\u20133 after two goals from [[Kennet Andersson]] and one from [[Martin Dahlin]]. They were 12th place in the rankings.\n\nSouth Korea's World Cup began with two draws against Spain (2\u20132) and [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (0\u20130). However they lost the decisive match 2\u20133 against title holders Germany. They were 20th place in the rankings.\n\n===1998: Four Asian nations at the World Cup===\nA total of 36 teams entered the competition. The Asian zone was allocated 3.5 places (out of 32) in the final tournament. Iran, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea qualified for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]]. Japan qualified for the first time.\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi Arabia were placed in Group C alongside South Africa, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and hosts France. Saudi Arabia started with a 1\u20130 defeat by Denmark. Next, France scored four to eliminate Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia (0\u20132\u20130), which again failed to show any resemblance to the 1994 team that reached the second round, played most of the game with ten men after defender [[Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi]] was given a direct red card in the 19th minute for a poor tackle on [[Bixente Lizarazu]]. Forward [[Thierry Henry]] scored two goals, while [[David Trezeguet]] and Lizarazu scored one each for France. With two goals against Saudi Arabia, South Africa led but watched in horror as the Saudis scored on two penalty kicks to gain a 2\u20132 draw. The Saudis entered the match under new coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, a longtime assistant, after Brazilian [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] was fired following the 4\u20130 loss to France.\n\n====Japan====\nJapan lost all three of its matches in its debut. In the first, it fell 1\u20130 to Argentina, with [[Gabriel Batistuta]] scoring for the opponents, knocking the ball over the Japanese goalkeeper on the edge of the penalty area. In the second match, against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], a late [[Davor \u0160uker]] goal ensured a 1\u20130 Croatia victory and his nation's progression to the next round, simultaneously eliminating Japan from the tournament. Japan's World Cup campaign officially ended with an unexpected 2\u20131 defeat to rank outsiders [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. Two goals from [[Theodore Whitmore]] gave Jamaica their first ever win in the World Cup finals, although [[Masashi Nakayama]] had the honour of scoring Japan's first-ever goal at the World Cup finals, which came in the 74th minute.\n\n====Iran====\nIran's first game of Group F was played against Yugoslavia, a 1\u20130 loss instigated by a [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]] free-kick. Iran recorded their first World Cup victory in the second game, beating the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 2\u20131, with [[Hamid Estili]] and [[Mehdi Mahdavikia]] scoring goals for Iran. The Iran\u2013U.S. World Cup match was preheated with much excitement owing to each country's political stance after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. In an act of defiance against all forms of hatred or politics in sports, however, both sides presented one another with gifts and flowers and took ceremonial pictures before the match kickoff. Following the defeat by Iran, the U.S. were eliminated from the World Cup. Iran played Germany in the third game, where they lost 2\u20130. German goals were scored from [[Oliver Bierhoff]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]]. The one win and two defeats left Iran third in the final group standings, not enough for progression to the next round.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea entered the 1998 World Cup without a single win to their name despite 14 World Cup games' experience. South Korea played Mexico, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the first game, South Korea lead in the 27th minute thanks to a [[Ha Seok-ju]] free-kick that was deflected into the Mexican goal. A couple of minutes after the goal was scored, however, Ha Seok-ju was sent off for a bad challenge from behind, and Mexico leveled the score through half-time substitute [[Ricardo Pel\u00e1ez]]. With approximately 15 minutes remaining, [[Luis Hern\u00e1ndez (footballer)|Luis Hern\u00e1ndez]] put Mexico in the lead with a simple tap-in. Hern\u00e1ndez then went on to complete the victory after scoring Mexico's third goal. South Korea had to wait four more years to record their first ever victory in a World Cup: its next game against the Netherlands was a heavy 0\u20135 defeat, the third-worst loss in the nation's World Cup history. Its third game was against Belgium. A big win would have given Belgium a chance of progressing and an early goal by [[Luc Nilis]] might have set them on the way. The Koreans, however, mounted stiff resistance and in the second half, and [[Yoo Sang-chul]] scored the equaliser in an eventual 1\u20131 draw.\n\n===2002: South Korea and Japan hosted the World Cup===\n[[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] were selected as hosts by [[FIFA]] on 31 May 1996. Initially, South Korea, Japan and [[Mexico]] presented three rival bids. However, the two Asian countries agreed to unite their bids shortly before the decision was made, and they were chosen unanimously in preference to Mexico. This was the first (and so far the only) World Cup to be hosted by two countries. The [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] was the tournament's 17th staging. It was also the first World Cup held in Asia, and the last in which the [[golden goal]] rule was utilized. South Korea and Japan, the co-hosts, qualified automatically, leaving 2.5 spots open for competition between 40 teams. Myanmar withdrew from the tournament after being placed in Group 2 but before any matches had been played, therefore reducing the group to three teams. [[Afghanistan national football team|Afghanistan]], [[Bhutan national football team|Bhutan]], North Korea and [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] did not participate in the qualification process. Asia's two remaining automatic qualifying berths were taken by Saudi Arabia and China PR. Iran failed to become a third Asian representative in the World Cup after losing their AFC/UEFA playoff against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].\n\n====China PR====\nChina PR qualified for the finals for the first time. Coached by [[Bora Milutinovi\u0107]] (the fifth national team he coached in five consecutive World Cups), the nation failed to earn a point or even score a goal. As football is widely followed in [[China]], national team success is considered to be a source of national pride. Around 300 million people tuned into broadcasts of China's 2002 World Cup matches, with a staggering 170 million new television sets being bought by citizens in order to watch their nation's first World Cup appearance. Its first game was against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Costa Rica dealt China PR a harsh blow by taking the lead against the run of play on 61 minutes. [[R\u00f3nald G\u00f3mez]]'s slick backheel played [[Paulo Wanchope]] in, and [[Wu Chengying]]'s challenge only popped the ball up for G\u00f3mez to fire in a left-foot shot. China PR had no time to gather their thoughts before they were 2\u20130 down. China's PR best moment of the first-half came on 39 minutes when they broke quickly after fending off a Costa Rica free-kick. Its second game against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] was a 0\u20134 defeat. China PR looked lively and appeared to be enjoying themselves, even when they overhit the ball, but China PR could not do anything about [[Roberto Carlos]]'s left-footed free-kick goal in the 15th minute. [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] then scored two and [[Ronaldinho]] one to effectively end the match. China PR searched for their first goal of the tournament in their third match, against Turkey. After just ten minutes, however, they were already down 0\u20132. Just before the half-hour mark, China PR almost scored their first goal of the tournament when [[Yang Chen (footballer, born 1974)|Yang Chen]] hit the post. [[Hasan \u015ea\u015f]] again set up Turkey with a cross to the far post, this time for [[\u00dcmit Davala]] to score off the post. China PR failed to score a goal and was eliminated from the tournament.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea beat [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 2\u20130 after [[Hwang Sun-hong]] and Yoo Sang-chul scored. The first real chance for the home side came in the 20th minute, when Yoo Sang-chul shot across the face of an outstretched [[Jerzy Dudek]]. South Korea started to apply more pressure and took the lead in the 25th minute: [[Lee Eul-yong]] played the ball into Hwang Sun-hong, who hit the ball first-time into the net. In the 53rd minute, South Korea scored their second goal: Yoo Sang-chul ran towards [[Tomasz Wa\u0142doch]] and [[Rados\u0142aw Ka\u0142u\u017cny]], then confidently shot between them and past goalkeeper Dudek. Even the President of Korea waved his hat at the goal, which secured South Korea's first-ever win at the World Cup finals. In its second match, against the United States, the game's first real scoring chance fell to the U.S.' [[Clint Mathis]], who scored with a left-footed drive from the middle of the penalty area. Later on, in the 78th minute, an [[Ahn Jung-hwan]] glancing header completely stunned American goalkeeper [[Brad Friedel]], who seemed rooted to the spot as the ball sailed into the net. South Korea missed the chance to take all three points right at the end when [[Choi Yong-soo]] stabbed another shot over the bar, with only Friedel to beat. South Korea played its third match against Portugal, needing a win to be guaranteed a place in the second round, though earning one point would suffice (for the U.S. as well, however).\n\nThe South Koreans tore apart a Portuguese side who had [[Jo\u00e3o Vieira Pinto|Jo\u00e3o Pinto]] and [[Beto (Portuguese footballer, born 1976)|Beto]] sent off. In the 70th minute, [[Park Ji-sung]] smashed in a brilliant goal for Korea to secure a 1\u20130 victory and Korea's progression to the next round. Here, South Korea beat Italy 2\u20131 in sudden-death extra time. In the 18th minute, [[Christian Vieri]] headed Italy into the lead from a [[Francesco Totti]] corner. Ahn Jung-hwan had the best chance for Korea in the 36th minute when he shot over the bar from close range. Two minutes from time, the stadium erupted as Italy defender [[Christian Panucci]] failed to clear the ball, with [[Seol Ki-hyun]] pouncing on his mistake. Totti received his second yellow card for diving in the penalty area. Ten-men Italy finally fell to a 117th-minute, golden goal header scored by Ahn Jung-hwan, who at the time was ironically playing for Italian club [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]].\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Spain were unable to win a second consecutive penalty shootout, losing to South Korea after having two goals controversially disallowed in normal time, with South Korea becoming the first (and, as of 2018, the only) team from outside Europe and the Americas to reach the last four of a World Cup. Four minutes after the restart, a Spanish goal was disallowed, while a second Spanish goal was disallowed after the linesman judged that the ball had gone out of play before [[Fernando Morientes]] headed the ball into the net. In the 100th minute, Morientes turned on a long throw-in and crashed his shot against the left post. Korea won 5\u20133 on penalties and became the first ever Asian nation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, where they would face Germany.\n\nThe match started slowly: South Korea kept possession well and Germany appeared content to keep the volume of the crowd down, with both sides entering half-time level at 0\u20130. In the 75th minute, however, [[Michael Ballack]] ran on to [[Oliver Neuville]]'s low cross; his shot was blocked by goalkeeper [[Lee Woon-jae]], but Ballack followed up to convert the rebound and secure Germany's place in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] with a 1\u20130 victory. With the semi-final defeat, Korea contested the third-place match in [[Daegu]] against the other defeated semi-finalist, Turkey. Turkey, however, won third place after an entertaining 3\u20132 victory in a match that included the fastest ever World Cup goal, scored by [[S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] striker [[Hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr]] after just 11 seconds. Lee Eul-yong replied in the ninth minute with a curling free-kick into the top right-hand corner, but shortly after, [[\u0130lhan Mans\u0131z]] put Turkey back in front in the 13th minute after splitting the South Korean defence by playing a swift one-two with \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr. [[Song Chong-gug]] then managed to stun Turkey goalkeeper [[R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber]] when his long-range shot deflected off of [[Cha Du-ri]]'s bottom, in injury time, for a last consolation goal that ended the game on a slight high note for the home fans.\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi Arabia were eliminated as the worst team in tournament, after three defeats and no goals scored, including an 0\u20138 loss to Germany, 0\u20131 to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and 0\u20133 to the Republic of Ireland.\n\n====Japan====\nHosts Japan topped their group with two wins and one draw. In the first match, they drew 2\u20132 with Belgium. [[Marc Wilmots]] broke the deadlock with a beautiful overhead kick in the 57th minute. Two minutes later, Japan's [[Takayuki Suzuki]], in the penalty area, got a foot on to [[Shinji Ono]]'s pass from the half-way line. In the 67th minute, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Junichi Inamoto]] ran through three defenders to give Japan a 2\u20131 lead. Five minutes later, the stadium was momentarily silenced when [[Peter Van Der Heyden]], beating the offside trap on the edge of the area, neatly lobbed Japan goalkeeper [[Seigo Narazaki]] as he came off his line. Japan advanced to the second round with a 1\u20130 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia]] and a 2\u20130 victory against [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]. Japan register their first ever World Cup finals victory. However, they subsequently exited the tournament during the Round of 16 after a 1\u20130 defeat to Turkey. \u00dcmit Davala headed Turkey into the lead from an [[Erg\u00fcn Penbe]]'s corner in the 12th minute. An [[Alessandro Santos]] free-kick crashed against the woodwork later on to give the Japanese some hope for the second-half. Japan made a couple of substitutions at half-time as they looked for fresh initiative. [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] deflected shot almost troubled Turkish goalkeeper R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Re\u00e7ber. Japan continued to look for the equaliser, with [[Akinori Nishizawa]]'s header on target and [[Tomokazu Myojin]] shooting just narrowly wide. With ten minutes left in the game, Nishizawa's shot flew over the bar and with it Japan's hopes of a place in the quarter-finals.\n\n===2006: Iran returned to the World Cup ===\nForty-four Asian teams are affiliated with FIFA, but [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]], Philippines, Bhutan and [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] decided not to take part, while [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] was banned from the competition, so a total of 39 teams took part to compete for 4.5 places in the World Cup. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan and Iran qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] finals.\n\n====Iran====\nIran started their campaign with high expectations from fans and media. Their first match was against Mexico in Group D. The game was level 1\u20131 at the half-time, but Iran lost at the end because of a defensive mistake, and the match finished 3\u20131, with goals scored by [[Omar Bravo]] and [[Zinha]] for Mexico and [[Yahya Golmohammadi]] for Iran. Iran then played Portugal in the second game, losing 2\u20130; goals were scored by [[Deco]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], the latter from a penalty. The two losses meant Iran was eliminated from the competition even before contesting their third and final game against [[Angola national football team|Angola]]. Iran drew 1\u20131, with [[Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh]] scoring the Iran goal.\n\n====Japan====\nJapan also failed to advance to the Round of 16 after finishing the group without a win, losing to Australia 1\u20133 in the first match. In the 26th minute, [[Shunsuke Nakamura]] scored the first goal, only for Australia to respond with three late goals in the 84th, 89th and 92nd minutes. In game two, Japan drew with Croatia 0\u20130. After defeats in the opening game, both Japan and Croatia seemed reluctant to take any early risks and for 20 minutes, little appeared to transpire. In the 21st minute, however, [[Niko Kranj\u010dar]] missed penalty, while five minutes into the second-half, the ball arrived at the far post only for [[Atsushi Yanagisawa]] to horrendously miss an open goal, skewing the ball back across the goalmouth. In Japan's third match, it lost to Brazil 1\u20134, despite scoring the game's first goal, in the 34th minute, from [[Keiji Tamada]].\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea won its first match 2\u20131, against [[Togo national football team|Togo]]; goals were scored by [[Lee Chun-soo]] and Ahn Jung-hwan. The victory marked Korea's their first World Cup finals win outside of home soil. In the second game, a 1\u20131 draw with France, Thierry Henry scored in the ninth minute, but Park Ji-sung leveled the score in 80th minute. Before the last match, against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], Korea had a strong chance to reach the round of 16. Switzerland scored first from a [[Philippe Senderos]] headed a goal off a [[Hakan Yakin]] free-kick in the 23rd minute. France went ahead against Togo in the 55th minute, which would mean that if Switzerland were to win, South Korea would be eliminated. Switzerland's star striker, [[Alexander Frei]], doubled Switzerland's lead with 13 minutes to play while France won their match, resulting in South Korea's elimination from the competition.\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi Arabia drew the first match 2\u20132 with [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]; Saudi Arabia had the lead as late as the 93rd minute, but [[Radhi Jaidi]] leveled the score. The Saudis' next game was against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], a 0\u20134 defeat. Saudi Arabia knew before kick-off that they had to score at least four goals to stand a chance of qualifying, but survival was clearly priority number one as they allowed Spain, who had changed their entire first 11, to feel their way into the match. [[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]] scored at the 39th minute and buried their chances of progression beyond the group stage.\n\n===2010: South Korea and Japan reaches the Round of 16, North Korea's return ===\nForty-three teams competed for spots at the 2010 World Cup; [[Laos national football team|Laos]], [[Brunei national football team|Brunei]] and the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] did not enter qualification. This was the first time Timor-Leste competed in World Cup qualification and the first time Australia attempted to qualify as a member of the AFC, having moved from the [[Oceania Football Confederation]] at the start of 2006. Asia's four automatic qualifying berths were taken by Australia, Japan]], North Korea and South Korea.\n\n====North Korea====\nNorth Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; they were drawn into [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group G|Group G]], and played their first match against five-time winners Brazil on 15 June. Brazil won 2\u20131 in a game where North Korea were well organised defensively and showed resilience, frustrating the Brazilians. Despite their best efforts, however, they were nevertheless outmatched and eventually broken down. [[Maicon Sisenando|Maicon]]'s relief was visible after his goal to finally put Brazil ahead. Their next game was against Portugal on 21 June, where they suffered a heavy 0\u20137 defeat. Despite starting well (much like against the Brazilians), with a defensive, well organised approach, once Portugal scored the first, the North Korean defense unfolded and the following six goals were scored with relative ease. In North Korea's last match, against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] on 25 June, the team fell 3\u20130. After losing all three matches in the group stages, North Korea were eliminated, finishing last in Group G.\n\n====South Korea====\nSouth Korea were drawn into Group B alongside Argentina, [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. South Korea registered the first win at the 2010 World Cup with a 2\u20130 victory over Greece, with goals scored by [[Lee Jung-soo]] and captain Park Ji-sung. In the second match, South Korea fell to Argentina 1\u20134, with striker [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] scoring a hat-trick and [[Park Chu-young]] scoring an own goal for the Argentines; [[Lee Chung-yong]] scored Korea's consolation goal. South Korea coach [[Huh Jung-moo]], who played against Argentina's [[Diego Maradona]] at the 1986 World Cup, saw his team struggle to live with Argentina's quick tempo and the quality of their pass-and-move football. The decisive match was with Nigeria, which ended 2\u20132 and with subsequent triumph for South Korea, because paired with Argentina's defeat of Greece, the draw sealed their first-ever progression beyond the group stage on foreign soil.\n\nAs Group B runners-up, South Korea faced Uruguay in the last 16. The South Koreans were effervescent in their attacking third but shaky in their defence, which was exposed as early as the eighth minute: [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] was fed on the left and played a low ball across the six-yard area, which was misjudged by goalkeeper [[Jung Sung-ryong]] and his statuesque defence but not by [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]] at the far post, who calmly slotted in for his second goal of the competition. In the 68th minute, the South Koreans' luck change when, off of a free-kick, Bolton's Lee Chung-yong pounced on [[Mauricio Victorino]]'s attempted headed clearance to score a nod-in from eight yards out; it was the first goal Uruguay had conceded in the tournament. With ten minutes remaining, Su\u00e1rez lurked on the fringes of the 18-yard area as a corner was swung in from the right. He cut in from the left before curling in a well-struck shot that left goalkeeper Jung Sung-ryong rooted as the ball clipped the post on its way in. The South Koreans pressed and should have taken the game into extra-time, but substitute [[Lee Dong-gook]]'s weak shot squirmed under the shirt of [[Fernando Muslera]] before it was comfortably cleared.\n\n====Australia====\nAustralia were drawn into [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]], which also featured three-time world champion Germany, [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]]. On 14 June, Australia faced Germany in [[Durban]]; [[Pim Verbeek]] surprisingly chose to play without a recognised striker. Australia were comprehensively defeated 4\u20130, and Verbeek was heavily criticised for his tactics,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/world-cup-2010/world-cup-news/verbeek-takes-blame-for-socceroos-defeat-20100614-y6gy.html|title=Verbeek takes blame for Socceroos defeat|work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=14 June 2010 | location=Sydney}}</ref> with chief SBS Football Analyst [[Craig Foster (Australian footballer)|Craig Foster]] calling for his immediate sacking.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/world-cup-2010/craig-foster-sack-pim-verbeek-immediately/story-fn4l4sip-1225880401600|title=Craig Foster \u2013 sack Pim Verbeek immediately|work=The Australian |date=16 June 2010|first=Tim|last=Hilferty}}</ref>\n\nAustralia's second group match, against Ghana, resulted in a 1\u20131 draw. Australia shot its only goal early in the first half by [[Brett Holman]] after Ghana's goalkeeper [[Richard Kingson]] fumbled the ball following a [[Mark Bresciano]] free-kick. Shortly after, a goal-bound strike from Ghana's [[Jonathan Mensah]] was blocked on the goal line by [[Harry Kewell]]'s upper arm, resulting in a penalty kick and a straight red card for Kewell. Ghanaian striker [[Asamoah Gyan]] scored the equalizing goal. Despite the man advantage, however, Ghana were mostly limited to long-range shots on Australia's goal, and some desperate defending from Australia saw the game finish a draw.\n\nIn their final group match, against Serbia, [[Tim Cahill]] was back from suspension and scored via a header in the second half to give Australia a 1\u20130 lead. Only four minutes later, Brett Holman doubled the scoreline with an impressive long-range effort. Late in the second half, Serbia managed to score a late goal through [[Marko Panteli\u0107]] after Australian goalkeeper [[Mark Schwarzer]] fumbled the ball, with the game ultimately ending at 2\u20131. Germany had defeated Ghana 1\u20130, which meant that both Australia and Ghana finished on four points. Ghana, however, progressed to the knockout stage due to their superior goal difference. Verbeek completed his term as Australian coach at the end of the 2010 World Cup.\n\n====Japan====\nJapan hung on to win their first-ever World Cup match on foreign soil, defeating Cameroon 1\u20130. The game's only goal came in the 39th minute when [[Keisuke Honda]] controlled a cross at the far post and stabbed the ball past goalkeeper [[Souleymanou Hamidou]]. In the second game, Japan lost 0\u20131 to the Netherlands. [[Wesley Sneijder]]'s powerful 52nd-minute winner from just outside the box settled a fascinating Group E contest between two contrasting sides who opened up in the second half and were creating good chances right up to the final whistle. Loitering just outside the penalty area, Sneijder lashed a powerful right-foot shot towards goal that goalkeeper [[Eiji Kawashima]] could only deflect into the net despite being well-placed to make the save. Japan had the best chance to level the score one minute from time, but unmarked substitute [[Shinji Okazaki]] fired over the net from ten yards out.\n\nJapan's third, decisive match was against Denmark. Midfielder [[Keisuke Honda]] opened the scoreline, bending a 30-yard free-kick past Danish goalkeeper [[Thomas S\u00f8rensen]] in the 17th minute. Just 13 minutes later, teammate [[Yasuhito End\u014d]] fired past S\u00f8rensen's outstretched hand to make it 2\u20130 for Japan. [[Takeshi Okada]]'s side had to survive a late scare as [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]] tapped in a rebound after goalkeeper Kawashima saved the Dane's penalty kick. However, substitute Shinji Okazaki's 88th-minute strike clinched second place in the group for Japan with a 3\u20131 victory.\n\nJapan faced [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the last 16. The match was decided by a penalty shootout after the score was locked at 0\u20130 for 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shootout and progressed to its first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay itself maintained a solid defence. The first-half produced the occasional chance on goal, with [[Lucas Barrios]] having a shot saved shortly before a long-distance shot from [[Daisuke Matsui]] hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with both sides producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of outright dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A penalty shootout ensued, during which [[Yuichi Komano]] missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of its penalties, clinching the win and subsequent progression to the quarter-finals.\n\n===2014: Disappointment for Asians===\nThe [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], held in Brazil, marked the first time since 1990 where no Asian team managed to win a game, and where the AFC was the only FIFA confederation without both wins and teams represented in the knockout stages.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sports.ndtv.com/fifa-world-cup-2014/features/226147-with-south-korea-s-loss-asia-out-of-world-cup |title=With South Korea's Loss, Asia Out of World Cup |access-date=2014-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805133218/http://sports.ndtv.com/fifa-world-cup-2014/features/226147-with-south-korea-s-loss-asia-out-of-world-cup |archive-date=2014-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/fifa-world-cup-2014/world-cup-news-2014/asian-teams-struggle-at-world-cup-showcases-problems-at-home-20140624-zsjhk.html Asian teams' struggle at World Cup showcases problems at home]</ref> Three of Asia's four qualifiers in 2010\u2014Australia, Japan and South Korea\u2014qualified for the 2014 tournament. Iran, meanwhile, qualified for the first time since 2006.\n\nAustralia was eliminated early despite good performances against Chile and the Netherlands that both ended in close losses (1\u20133 and 2\u20133 respectively). In their third match, however, they were blown-out 3\u20130 to defending World Cup champions Spain, who were themselves also mathematically eliminated from the tournament.\n\nJapan opened the scoring in its first match against the Ivory Coast, but lost the lead en route to an eventual 1\u20132 defeat. In the following games, the Japanese failed to break Greece's tight defence and finished in a goalless draw, and afterwards, despite equalizing [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] at half-time, eventually lost 4\u20131 to ensure an early tournament exit.\n\nSouth Korea opened the score against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] after a blunder by goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]], but wound up conceding the equalizing goal shortly after. A high-scoring match with [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] had the Koreans defeated 4\u20132, and a 1\u20130 loss to Belgium ended Korea's campaign.\n\nAfter an opening 0\u20130 draw with Nigeria, the Iranian defense held Argentina goalless for most of the match before a [[Lionel Messi]] goal in injury time. Needing to beat the already-eliminated [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to clinch the group's second spot in the knockout stages, Iran wound up defeated 3\u20131.\n\n===2018:  Five Asian teams at FIFA World Cup===\nThe [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], held in Russia, marked the first time five Asian teams qualified for the FIFA World Cup finals 2018 in Russia. Only Japan advanced past the group stage, a feat aided by fair-play points in tie-breaking, at the expense of [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]]. Aside from Australia, who only got a draw and two defeats, the other three had at least one win: Saudi Arabia got a 2-1 comeback over [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], Iran defeated [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], and in the biggest upset, South Korea beat the defending champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]].<ref>[http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/world-cup/907483/asian-teams-2018-world-cup-graded/ Asian teams at the 2018 World Cup graded]</ref> In the round of 16, Japan surprised a favored [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and got a 2-0 lead, only to suffer a 3-2 comeback, with the 2 goals scored by Belgium from [[Jan Vertonghen]] and [[Marouane Fellaini]] The match ended with a Belgian goal by [[Nacer Chadli]] in the last minute of stoppage time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Belgium dig deep to edge out Japan |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/match/300331551/#match-summary |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2 July 2018}}</ref>.South Koreans were out from group stage in this World Cup but a beating Germany's still big achievement for Korea,Asian(Specially,Korea Rep eliminated Germany)...\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/fwc_prel_history_by_year_25982.pdf FIFA Fact Sheet: History of the FIFA World Cup (TM) Preliminary Competition (by year)] (44 page PDF document)\n\n{{FIFA World Cup}}\n{{Countries at the FIFA World Cup}}\n\n[[Category:Countries at the FIFA World Cup| ]]\n[[Category:Association football in Asia]]\n[[Category:FIFA World Cup records and statistics]]\n", "name_user": "DC Voter", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added \"the\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_nations_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup"}

Each season, Serna builds on influences from modern and contemporary sculpture and painting to create clothing focused on form and function.
