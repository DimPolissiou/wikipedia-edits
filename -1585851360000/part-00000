He was heavily relied upon for the later publications of [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]]{{Citation needed|reason=Livy's first pentad predates Dionysius|date=April 2017}}.  He writes extensively on the myth, sometimes attributing direct quotations to its figures.  The myth spans the first 2 volumes of his ''Roman Antiquities'', beginning with Book I chapter 73 and concluding in Book II chapter 56. \n{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Romulus and Remus===\n\n====Origins and survival in the wild====\nDionysius claims that the twins were born to a [[Vestal virgins|vestal]] named [[Rea Silvia|Ilia Silvia]] (sometimes called Rea).  Her family descends from [[Aeneas]] of Troy and the daughter of [[Latinus|King Latinus]] of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Original Latin tribes]].  [[Procas]], her grandfather had willed the throne to his son [[Numitor]] but he was later deposed by her uncle, [[Amulius]].  For fear of the threat that Numitor's heirs might pose, the king had Ilia's brother, Aegestus killed and blamed robbers.  The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance.  Amulius then appointed Ilia to the [[Vestal virgins|Vestal priestesshood]], where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further male rivals.  Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.\n\nThe different accounts of the twins' conception are laid out, but Dionysius declines to choose one over the others.  The sources variously relate that it was a suitor, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity), or even the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] himself.  The latter is supposed to have comforted Ilia by making her grieve, and telling her that she would bear twins whose bravery and triumphs would be unmatched.  Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties.  Amulius suspected her and employed physicians and his wife to monitor her for signs of being with child.  When he did discover the truth, she was placed under armed guard.  After being informed of the delivery of the twins, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets.  The third child had been concealed from the guards present.  Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.\n\nCiting [[Fabius]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius]], [[Cato the Elder|Porcius Cato]], and [[Piso]], Dionysius recounts the most common tale.  The king orders the twins to be tossed into the Tiber.  When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream.  They left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the [[ficus Ruminalis]].  After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket is overturned by a rock and they are dumped into the mud.  A she-wolf finds them there and [[Breastfeeding|nurses]] them in front of her lair (the ''[[Lupercal]]'').  Plutarch places the [[Lupercal]] as at the foot of Palantine hill along the road to the [[Circus Maximus|Roman chariot grounds]] and was the source of a [[Spring (hydrology)|natural spring]].\n\n====Youth====\nThe twins were discovered by unnamed herdsmen, and when they arrive, the she-wolf calmly retreats into the cave.  [[Faustulus]], the man in charge of the royal [[abattoir]], happened upon the scene.  He had heard the story of Ilia's twin birth and the king's order, but never let on that he suspected the [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] were one and the same.  He persuaded the shepherds to allow him to take the boys home, and brought them to his wife, who had just delivered a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child.  Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Dionysius claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs they grew, the boys exhibited the graces and behavior of the royal-born.  They passed their days living as herdsmen in the mountains, spending many nights in huts of reeds and sticks.\n\norphan footnote.<ref>In his account of the conflict with Amulius, Livy claims that Faustulus, had always known that the boys had been abandoned by the order of the king and had hoped that they are of Royal blood, ''Histories'' I.5</ref>\n\nDionysius relates an alternate, \"non-fantastical\" version of Romulus and Remus' birth, survival and youth.  In this version, Numitor managed to switch the twins at birth with two other infants.  The twins were delivered by their grandfather to Faustulus to be fostered by him and his wife.  Faustulus was descended from the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|first Greek]] colonists in [[Latium]].  He was the caretaker for Amulius' holdings around Palatine hill.  He was persuaded to care for the twins by his brother [[Faustinus]], who tended the kings herds on nearby Aventine hill.\n\nTheir adopted mother was Faustulus' wife Laurentia, a former [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]].  According to Plutarch, ''lupa''(Latin for \"wolf\") was a common term for members of her profession and this gave rise to the she-wolf legend.  The twins receive a proper [[Education in ancient Rome|education]] in the city of [[Gabii]].\n\n====Overthrow of Amulius====\nAccording to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor's herdsmen.  In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and capture while Romulus was elsewhere.  In [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|Aelius Tubero's]] version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the [[Lupercalia]], requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.\n\nAfter rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa.  To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage.  With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus set his sights on Amulius, instead.  He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards.  Meanwhile, after being turned over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joins with him in their own effort to topple Amulius.  When Romulus joined them at Numitor's home, the three of them began to plan their next move.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nBack home, Faustulus had begun to worry about how the twins' claims will be heard in Alba.  He decides to bolster them by bringing the basket in which they were abandoned to the city.  He's stopped by suspicious guards at the gates and he and the basket are seen by none-other-than the servant who had taken them to the river those many years before.  Under the questioning of the king, and after the king's insincere offers of benevolence toward his nephews, Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.\n\nAmulius sent Faustulus and his men to find the boys.  He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with.  Unfortunately for the king, the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches instead revealed everything that had happened at the palace.\n\nThe twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.\n\nPlutarch continues the same alternate version of the twins' parentage and youth.  After the boys had returned home from their studies in Gabii, Numitor had the twins attack his own herdsmen and drive off his own cattle to contrive a complaint against his brother.  To placate him, Amulius ordered not only the twins to be brought to the palace for trial, but all the others who were present, as well.  This is exactly what Numitor had hoped for.  When Romulus and Remus arrived in Alba, their grandfather revealed their true identity and he, the twins and the other herdsmen joined forces to attack Amulius, apparently killing him.\n\n====Death of Remus====\nThe now re-installed King Numitor granted Romulus and Remus control over the area around where Rome would be founded and sent some of Alba Longa's commoners and nobles along with them.  These included volunteers as well as his enemies, and other troublemakers and fifty families of the descendants of [[Aeneas|the Greeks]] who had settled in [[Old Latium|Italy]] after the [[Trojan War]]. The commoners were given provisions, weapons, slaves and livestock.\n\nWanting to use competition to better complete the many tasks ahead of them, each twin took command of half of the new group of colonists and natives.  Instead, the two groups each wanted their twin to be king.  Eventually, both Romulus and Remus began to harbor their own ambitions of being the sole ruler of the new city.  Things came to a head when a dispute broke out over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built.  Romulus wanted to build on [[Palatine Hill]] for its significance to their childhood.  Remus chose [[Aventine Hill]] for its strategic advantages.  Finally, with no resolution in sight, they took the matter to Numitor.  He told each twin to stake out a spot on an appointed morning at dawn and wait for a \"[[Augury|bird omen]]\" from the gods to settle things.\n\nThey took his suggestion and the two brothers took their positions along with guard to prevent cheating.  No birds appeared to Romulus, but he tried to trick Remus by sending a message that he should come to him right away.  Ashamed, the messengers took their time, and while en route, Remus saw 6 vultures.  The messengers brought Remus back to his brother and when they arrived, Romulus was asked what type of bird he had seen (apparently owing to the ruse).  Unsure, Romulus was suddenly saved by the sudden arrival of 12 vultures.  He dismissed his brother's query and declared himself the winner.  Furious Remus refused to accept defeat.  This reignited the conflict between them.\n\nOutwardly, each twin acknowledged the other's claim to having won: Remus by seeing the vultures first, and Romulus by seeing more of them.  Privately, however, neither was willing to give in.  An armed battle broke out between their followers resulting in deaths among both.  Faustulus was so distraught over his inability to end the strife between his adopted sons that he threw himself into the middle of the fighting and was killed.  Remus also fell.  Romulus was devastated at his personal losses as well as the many suffered by the twins' followers.  Only after the intervention of Laurentia was he able to return to the job of founding the city.\n\nOther sources who are unnamed by Plutarch claimed that despite his anger over Romulus' conduct during the contest of the augury, Remus conceded and the construction of the city began on Palatine Hill.  Out of resentment, he derided the city's newly-built walls and demonstrated their ineffectiveness by leaping over them, saying that an enemy of Romulus could do the same.  In response, [[Celer (builder)|Celer]], the job's foreman, killed him on the spot with a blow to the head and implied that Remus himself had become his brother's enemy.\n\n===Foundation of Rome by Romulus===\nBefore construction on the city began [[Romulus]] made sacrifices and received good omens, and he then ordered the populace to ritually atone for their guilt. The city's fortifications were first and then housing for the populace.  He assembled the people and gave them the choice as to what type of government they wanted.  After his address, which extolled bravery in war abroad and moderation at home, and in which Romulus denied any need to remain in power, the people decided to remain a kingdom and asked him to remain its king.  Before accepting he looked for a sign of the approval of the gods.  He prayed and witnessed an auspicious lightning bolt, after which he declared that no king shall take the throne without receiving approval from the gods.\n\n====Institutions====\nHe divided Rome into 3 [[Roman tribe|tribes]], each selected a [[Tribune]] in charge of each.  Each tribe was divided into 10 [[Curia]], and each of those into smaller units.  He divided the kingdom's land holdings between them.  Plutarch suggests that [[Classical Athens|Athenian institutions]] were the inspiration for Romulus' creation of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] class from the wealthy and virtuous.  All other Romans formed the [[Pleb]]eian class.  The Patricians were put in charge of religious, legal, and civil institutions, while the Plebs were to be farmers, herders, and tradesmen.  Each curia was responsible for providing soldiers in the event of war.\n\nTo maintain order, every pleb had the right to choose a Patrician in a system of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]] (''clientela'').  All patrons (''patronus'') were required to protect the rights and interests of those plebs (''cliens'') beneath them.  In return, all plebs were required to support his patron in his endeavors and assist him when needed.  It was illegal for either party to testify against one another or otherwise act against the interests of the other.  Romulus then proceeded to establish the [[Roman senate|senate]]\u2014another act that Dionysius attributes to Greek influence.  He selected 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles to become his personal bodyguard and messengers.  The ''celeres'' were so-named either for their quickness or, according to [[Valerius Antias]], for their commander.  These were the first [[Roman cavalry]] and were vital to many Roman victories.\n\nRomulus then delimited the [[Separation of power|various powers]] of the institutions he had created.  The Roman king was made the ultimate authority in all religious and legal matters.  He would personally hear the cases of \"the greatest crimes\", but after reaching a decision, his opinion would be subject to approval by the people.  He would be the commander in chief of the military in wartime.\n\nThe senate would have the power to decide any matter or issue brought to them by the king with a binding vote (attributed by Dionysius to the [[Lacedaemonians]]).  The popular assemblies had the power to elect magistrates, pass laws, and declare war at the king's discretion.\n\nRomulus passed laws meant to encourage child-rearing.  He welcomed free men of any background to settle in the new city with promises of citizenship and an offer of [[Right of asylum|protection]] from those from home who might be pursuing them.  Immigrants flocked to Rome as a result.  Rome would also benefit from their practice of sending colonists to newly conquered cities and allowing the subjugated to carry on as they had before.  More common in the Greek world was to treat those they defeated harshly.  Rome grew 10 times its size during Romulus' reign.\n\nIn an extensive exploration of the various, lurid traditions of the day, Dionysius effusively praises the manner in which Romulus organized and established Rome's religious customs and practices.  He attributes to the king everything from the founding of temples to defining the sphere of individual gods; their festivals and the blessings they would each bestow.  Among the Greek and native traditions, he kept only those he deemed worthy and rejected any that were too unseemly or otherwise unfit for Roman society.\n\nAccording to [[Terentius Varro]], Romulus appointed a large number of Roman men and women to religious offices during his reign.  He also allowed the various curiae to select their own.  He adopted the Greek practice of appointing children to participate in the city's ceremonies.  He established an office of augury, which would ensure the approval of the gods during all worship undertaken.  Each curia was required to sacrifice and give offerings in a way so specified.  He established budgets for religious practice in the city.\n\n====Legal system====\n[[File:Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696]]\nAgain, Dionysius thoroughly describes the laws of other nations before contrasting the approach of Romulus and lauding his work.  The Roman law governing marriage is, according to his ''Antiquities'', an elegant yet simple improvement over that of other nations, most of which he harshly derides.  By declaring that wives would share equally in the possessions and conduct of their husband, Romulus promoted virtue in the former and deterred mistreatment by the latter.  Wives could inherit upon their husband's death.  A wife's adultery was a serious crime, however, drunkenness could be a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate punishment.  Because of his laws, Dionysius claims that not a single Roman couple divorced over the following five centuries.  His laws governing parental rights, in particular, those that allow fathers to maintain power over their adult children were an improvement over those of others.\n\nUnder the laws of Romulus, native-born free Roman's were limited to two forms of employment: farming and the army.  All other occupations were filled by slaves or non-Roman labor.\n\nRomulus used the trappings of his office to encourage compliance with the law.  His court was imposing and filled with loyal soldiers and he was always accompanied by the [[lictor|12 lictors]] appointed to be his attendants.\n\n====Rape of the Sabine women====\n{{Further information|Battle of the Lacus Curtius}}\nAccording to [[Gnaeus Gellius]], in Romulus' fourth year in power, the recently founded city of Rome, its population having swollen with immigrants, found itself surrounded by unfriendly neighbors and short of marriageable women.  Romulus sought to solve both problems through intermarrying with the other cities in the region, but he was rebuffed.  His solution, having been approved by his grandfather, received the auspices of the gods, and the support of the senate began with the announcement of a spectacular festival and competitions to honor the god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], and to which all of Rome's neighbors were welcome.  They came from far and wide, sometimes entire families, to attend and participate.\n\nTo the shock and horror of the guests, at the king's signal Romans began [[Bride kidnapping|abducting]] the young women in attendance. Later, the women are brought before him where he assures them that he and the other men of Rome intend to honorably marry them and that they won't be sexually exploited in any way. This eases their fears.\n\nThe cities of  [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Crustumerium]], and [[Antemnae]] petition [[Tatius]], king of the [[Sabines]] to lead a joint attack in response to the kidnappings.  Their goal was stymied by Rome's own diplomatic efforts and the other three cities eventually concluded that Tatius was delaying any action on purpose. They decided to attack Rome without the Sabines and their armies were defeated and their cities captured each in turn.\n\nThe wars that resulted from the mass abduction committed by the Romans came to a climax in an epic battle fought at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. After the Sabines had captured the Roman Citadel through guile, they occupied the most strategically important point in the city with the help, knowing or otherwise, of [[Tarpeia]]. After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides.\n\n[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1799]]\nIn the course of the battle, both sides found themselves on the verge of defeat, only to turn the tide back in the nick of time. Romulus himself was injured by a rock to the head. The fighting ceased only by the coming of dusk. Afterward, the Sabine women, led by the noble [[Hersilia]], convinced the two kings to make peace.\n\nAfter a ceasefire, the nations agreed to become a single kingdom under the joint rule of Romulus and Tatius.  The city was expanded and its institutions were adjusted to accommodate the new increase in population and to demonstrate their mutual goodwill.  The joint kingship lasted for four years until the death of Tatius.  During this time they conquered the [[Camerini]] and made their city a [[Romanization (cultural)|Roman colony]].\n\n====Deaths of Tatius and Romulus====\nThe two peoples are merged under a joint throne with Rome as the capital.  The Sabines and Romans alike were then declared ''[[Quirites]]'',  from the Sabine city of [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]].  To honor the Sabine women, when Romulus divided the city into 30 [[Curia|local councils]], he named them after the women.  He also recruited three new units of knights and called them [[Roman cavalry|Ramnenses Tatiensis]] (from the two kings' names).\n\nSome of Tatius' friends victimized some [[Laurentum|Laurentii]] and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus to hand the perpetrators over to them.  A group of Sabines waylayed the ambassadors as they slept on the way home.  Some escaped and when word got back to Rome, Romulus promptly turned the men responsible\u2014including one of Tatius' family members\u2014over to a new group of ambassadors.  Tatius followed the group out of the city and freed the accused men by force.  Later, while both kings were participating in a sacrifice in [[Lavinium]], Tatius was killed in retribution.\n\nThe account of [[Licinius Macer]] recounts that Tatius was killed when he went alone to try and convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed.  When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stones him to death.\n\nAfter his rule had turned more dictatorial, Romulus met his end, whether through actions divine or earthly.  According to some reports, Romulus is swept up into heaven, where he takes his place among the gods as [[Quirinus]].  Others point to the hands of the nobility, who had grown ever more resentful of their treatment by the king.\n\n==Editions==\n* Collected Works edited by [[Friedrich Sylburg]] (1536\u20131596) (parallel Greek and Latin) (Frankfurt 1586) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=PMgaIq4TBZEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false available at Google Books])\n*Complete edition by [[Johann Jakob Reiske]] (1774\u20131777){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n*''Archaeologia'' by [[A.

Pompeius]] and [[Ammaeus]] (two, one of which is about Thucydides).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Dionysian ''imitatio''===\n{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}\n''Dionysian imitatio'' is the [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Dionysius, who conceived it as the [[rhetoric]]al practice of emulating, adapting, reworking, and enriching a source text by an earlier author.<ref name=\"Ruthven79\">Ruthven (1979) pp. 103\u20134</ref><ref name=\"Jansen\">Jansen (2008)</ref>\n\nDionysius' concept marked a significant departure from the concept of ''[[mimesis]]'' formulated by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC, which was only concerned with \"imitation of nature\" and not \"imitation of other authors.\"<ref name=\"Ruthven79\"/> Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted Dionysius' method of ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.<ref name=\"Ruthven79\"/>\n\n==Foundation myth==\n\nDionysius is one of the primary sources for the accounts of the Roman foundation myth and the myth of [[Romulus and Remus]].  He was heavily relied upon for the later publications of [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]]{{Citation needed|reason=Livy's first pentad predates Dionysius|date=April 2017}}.  He writes extensively on the myth, sometimes attributing direct quotations to its figures.  The myth spans the first 2 volumes of his ''Roman Antiquities'', beginning with Book I chapter 73 and concluding in Book II chapter 56. \n{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Romulus and Remus===\n\n====Origins and survival in the wild====\nDionysius claims that the twins were born to a [[Vestal virgins|vestal]] named [[Rea Silvia|Ilia Silvia]] (sometimes called Rea).  Her family descends from [[Aeneas]] of Troy and the daughter of [[Latinus|King Latinus]] of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Original Latin tribes]].  [[Procas]], her grandfather had willed the throne to his son [[Numitor]] but he was later deposed by her uncle, [[Amulius]].  For fear of the threat that Numitor's heirs might pose, the king had Ilia's brother, Aegestus killed and blamed robbers.  The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance.  Amulius then appointed Ilia to the [[Vestal virgins|Vestal priestesshood]], where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further male rivals.  Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.\n\nThe different accounts of the twins' conception are laid out, but Dionysius declines to choose one over the others.  The sources variously relate that it was a suitor, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity), or even the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] himself.  The latter is supposed to have comforted Ilia by making her grieve, and telling her that she would bear twins whose bravery and triumphs would be unmatched.  Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties.  Amulius suspected her and employed physicians and his wife to monitor her for signs of being with child.  When he did discover the truth, she was placed under armed guard.  After being informed of the delivery of the twins, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets.  The third child had been concealed from the guards present.  Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.\n\nCiting [[Fabius]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius]], [[Cato the Elder|Porcius Cato]], and [[Piso]], Dionysius recounts the most common tale.  The king orders the twins to be tossed into the Tiber.  When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream.  They left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the [[ficus Ruminalis]].  After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket is overturned by a rock and they are dumped into the mud.  A she-wolf finds them there and [[Breastfeeding|nurses]] them in front of her lair (the ''[[Lupercal]]'').  Plutarch places the [[Lupercal]] as at the foot of Palantine hill along the road to the [[Circus Maximus|Roman chariot grounds]] and was the source of a [[Spring (hydrology)|natural spring]].\n\n====Youth====\nThe twins were discovered by unnamed herdsmen, and when they arrive, the she-wolf calmly retreats into the cave.  [[Faustulus]], the man in charge of the royal [[abattoir]], happened upon the scene.  He had heard the story of Ilia's twin birth and the king's order, but never let on that he suspected the [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] were one and the same.  He persuaded the shepherds to allow him to take the boys home, and brought them to his wife, who had just delivered a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child.  Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Dionysius claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs they grew, the boys exhibited the graces and behavior of the royal-born.  They passed their days living as herdsmen in the mountains, spending many nights in huts of reeds and sticks.\n\norphan footnote.<ref>In his account of the conflict with Amulius, Livy claims that Faustulus, had always known that the boys had been abandoned by the order of the king and had hoped that they are of Royal blood, ''Histories'' I.5</ref>\n\nDionysius relates an alternate, \"non-fantastical\" version of Romulus and Remus' birth, survival and youth.  In this version, Numitor managed to switch the twins at birth with two other infants.  The twins were delivered by their grandfather to Faustulus to be fostered by him and his wife.  Faustulus was descended from the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|first Greek]] colonists in [[Latium]].  He was the caretaker for Amulius' holdings around Palatine hill.  He was persuaded to care for the twins by his brother [[Faustinus]], who tended the kings herds on nearby Aventine hill.\n\nTheir adopted mother was Faustulus' wife Laurentia, a former [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]].  According to Plutarch, ''lupa''(Latin for \"wolf\") was a common term for members of her profession and this gave rise to the she-wolf legend.  The twins receive a proper [[Education in ancient Rome|education]] in the city of [[Gabii]].\n\n====Overthrow of Amulius====\nAccording to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor's herdsmen.  In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and capture while Romulus was elsewhere.  In [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|Aelius Tubero's]] version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the [[Lupercalia]], requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.\n\nAfter rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa.  To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage.  With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus set his sights on Amulius, instead.  He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards.  Meanwhile, after being turned over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joins with him in their own effort to topple Amulius.  When Romulus joined them at Numitor's home, the three of them began to plan their next move.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nBack home, Faustulus had begun to worry about how the twins' claims will be heard in Alba.  He decides to bolster them by bringing the basket in which they were abandoned to the city.  He's stopped by suspicious guards at the gates and he and the basket are seen by none-other-than the servant who had taken them to the river those many years before.  Under the questioning of the king, and after the king's insincere offers of benevolence toward his nephews, Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.\n\nAmulius sent Faustulus and his men to find the boys.  He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with.  Unfortunately for the king, the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches instead revealed everything that had happened at the palace.\n\nThe twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.\n\nPlutarch continues the same alternate version of the twins' parentage and youth.  After the boys had returned home from their studies in Gabii, Numitor had the twins attack his own herdsmen and drive off his own cattle to contrive a complaint against his brother.  To placate him, Amulius ordered not only the twins to be brought to the palace for trial, but all the others who were present, as well.  This is exactly what Numitor had hoped for.  When Romulus and Remus arrived in Alba, their grandfather revealed their true identity and he, the twins and the other herdsmen joined forces to attack Amulius, apparently killing him.\n\n====Death of Remus====\nThe now re-installed King Numitor granted Romulus and Remus control over the area around where Rome would be founded and sent some of Alba Longa's commoners and nobles along with them.  These included volunteers as well as his enemies, and other troublemakers and fifty families of the descendants of [[Aeneas|the Greeks]] who had settled in [[Old Latium|Italy]] after the [[Trojan War]]. The commoners were given provisions, weapons, slaves and livestock.\n\nWanting to use competition to better complete the many tasks ahead of them, each twin took command of half of the new group of colonists and natives.  Instead, the two groups each wanted their twin to be king.  Eventually, both Romulus and Remus began to harbor their own ambitions of being the sole ruler of the new city.  Things came to a head when a dispute broke out over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built.  Romulus wanted to build on [[Palatine Hill]] for its significance to their childhood.  Remus chose [[Aventine Hill]] for its strategic advantages.  Finally, with no resolution in sight, they took the matter to Numitor.  He told each twin to stake out a spot on an appointed morning at dawn and wait for a \"[[Augury|bird omen]]\" from the gods to settle things.\n\nThey took his suggestion and the two brothers took their positions along with guard to prevent cheating.  No birds appeared to Romulus, but he tried to trick Remus by sending a message that he should come to him right away.  Ashamed, the messengers took their time, and while en route, Remus saw 6 vultures.  The messengers brought Remus back to his brother and when they arrived, Romulus was asked what type of bird he had seen (apparently owing to the ruse).  Unsure, Romulus was suddenly saved by the sudden arrival of 12 vultures.  He dismissed his brother's query and declared himself the winner.  Furious Remus refused to accept defeat.  This reignited the conflict between them.\n\nOutwardly, each twin acknowledged the other's claim to having won: Remus by seeing the vultures first, and Romulus by seeing more of them.  Privately, however, neither was willing to give in.  An armed battle broke out between their followers resulting in deaths among both.  Faustulus was so distraught over his inability to end the strife between his adopted sons that he threw himself into the middle of the fighting and was killed.  Remus also fell.  Romulus was devastated at his personal losses as well as the many suffered by the twins' followers.  Only after the intervention of Laurentia was he able to return to the job of founding the city.\n\nOther sources who are unnamed by Plutarch claimed that despite his anger over Romulus' conduct during the contest of the augury, Remus conceded and the construction of the city began on Palatine Hill.  Out of resentment, he derided the city's newly-built walls and demonstrated their ineffectiveness by leaping over them, saying that an enemy of Romulus could do the same.  In response, [[Celer (builder)|Celer]], the job's foreman, killed him on the spot with a blow to the head and implied that Remus himself had become his brother's enemy.\n\n===Foundation of Rome by Romulus===\nBefore construction on the city began [[Romulus]] made sacrifices and received good omens, and he then ordered the populace to ritually atone for their guilt. The city's fortifications were first and then housing for the populace.  He assembled the people and gave them the choice as to what type of government they wanted.  After his address, which extolled bravery in war abroad and moderation at home, and in which Romulus denied any need to remain in power, the people decided to remain a kingdom and asked him to remain its king.  Before accepting he looked for a sign of the approval of the gods.  He prayed and witnessed an auspicious lightning bolt, after which he declared that no king shall take the throne without receiving approval from the gods.\n\n====Institutions====\nHe divided Rome into 3 [[Roman tribe|tribes]], each selected a [[Tribune]] in charge of each.  Each tribe was divided into 10 [[Curia]], and each of those into smaller units.  He divided the kingdom's land holdings between them.  Plutarch suggests that [[Classical Athens|Athenian institutions]] were the inspiration for Romulus' creation of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] class from the wealthy and virtuous.  All other Romans formed the [[Pleb]]eian class.  The Patricians were put in charge of religious, legal, and civil institutions, while the Plebs were to be farmers, herders, and tradesmen.  Each curia was responsible for providing soldiers in the event of war.\n\nTo maintain order, every pleb had the right to choose a Patrician in a system of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]] (''clientela'').  All patrons (''patronus'') were required to protect the rights and interests of those plebs (''cliens'') beneath them.  In return, all plebs were required to support his patron in his endeavors and assist him when needed.  It was illegal for either party to testify against one another or otherwise act against the interests of the other.  Romulus then proceeded to establish the [[Roman senate|senate]]\u2014another act that Dionysius attributes to Greek influence.  He selected 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles to become his personal bodyguard and messengers.  The ''celeres'' were so-named either for their quickness or, according to [[Valerius Antias]], for their commander.  These were the first [[Roman cavalry]] and were vital to many Roman victories.\n\nRomulus then delimited the [[Separation of power|various powers]] of the institutions he had created.  The Roman king was made the ultimate authority in all religious and legal matters.  He would personally hear the cases of \"the greatest crimes\", but after reaching a decision, his opinion would be subject to approval by the people.  He would be the commander in chief of the military in wartime.\n\nThe senate would have the power to decide any matter or issue brought to them by the king with a binding vote (attributed by Dionysius to the [[Lacedaemonians]]).  The popular assemblies had the power to elect magistrates, pass laws, and declare war at the king's discretion.\n\nRomulus passed laws meant to encourage child-rearing.  He welcomed free men of any background to settle in the new city with promises of citizenship and an offer of [[Right of asylum|protection]] from those from home who might be pursuing them.  Immigrants flocked to Rome as a result.  Rome would also benefit from their practice of sending colonists to newly conquered cities and allowing the subjugated to carry on as they had before.  More common in the Greek world was to treat those they defeated harshly.  Rome grew 10 times its size during Romulus' reign.\n\nIn an extensive exploration of the various, lurid traditions of the day, Dionysius effusively praises the manner in which Romulus organized and established Rome's religious customs and practices.  He attributes to the king everything from the founding of temples to defining the sphere of individual gods; their festivals and the blessings they would each bestow.  Among the Greek and native traditions, he kept only those he deemed worthy and rejected any that were too unseemly or otherwise unfit for Roman society.\n\nAccording to [[Terentius Varro]], Romulus appointed a large number of Roman men and women to religious offices during his reign.  He also allowed the various curiae to select their own.  He adopted the Greek practice of appointing children to participate in the city's ceremonies.  He established an office of augury, which would ensure the approval of the gods during all worship undertaken.  Each curia was required to sacrifice and give offerings in a way so specified.  He established budgets for religious practice in the city.\n\n====Legal system====\n[[File:Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696]]\nAgain, Dionysius thoroughly describes the laws of other nations before contrasting the approach of Romulus and lauding his work.  The Roman law governing marriage is, according to his ''Antiquities'', an elegant yet simple improvement over that of other nations, most of which he harshly derides.  By declaring that wives would share equally in the possessions and conduct of their husband, Romulus promoted virtue in the former and deterred mistreatment by the latter.  Wives could inherit upon their husband's death.  A wife's adultery was a serious crime, however, drunkenness could be a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate punishment.  Because of his laws, Dionysius claims that not a single Roman couple divorced over the following five centuries.  His laws governing parental rights, in particular, those that allow fathers to maintain power over their adult children were an improvement over those of others.\n\nUnder the laws of Romulus, native-born free Roman's were limited to two forms of employment: farming and the army.  All other occupations were filled by slaves or non-Roman labor.\n\nRomulus used the trappings of his office to encourage compliance with the law.  His court was imposing and filled with loyal soldiers and he was always accompanied by the [[lictor|12 lictors]] appointed to be his attendants.\n\n====Rape of the Sabine women====\n{{Further information|Battle of the Lacus Curtius}}\nAccording to [[Gnaeus Gellius]], in Romulus' fourth year in power, the recently founded city of Rome, its population having swollen with immigrants, found itself surrounded by unfriendly neighbors and short of marriageable women.  Romulus sought to solve both problems through intermarrying with the other cities in the region, but he was rebuffed.  His solution, having been approved by his grandfather, received the auspices of the gods, and the support of the senate began with the announcement of a spectacular festival and competitions to honor the god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], and to which all of Rome's neighbors were welcome.  They came from far and wide, sometimes entire families, to attend and participate.\n\nTo the shock and horror of the guests, at the king's signal Romans began [[Bride kidnapping|abducting]] the young women in attendance. Later, the women are brought before him where he assures them that he and the other men of Rome intend to honorably marry them and that they won't be sexually exploited in any way. This eases their fears.\n\nThe cities of  [[Caenina]], [[Crustumerium]], and [[Antemnae]] petition [[Tatius]], king of the [[Sabines]] to lead a joint attack in response to the kidnappings.  Their goal was stymied by Rome's own diplomatic efforts and the other three cities eventually concluded that Tatius was delaying any action on purpose. They decided to attack Rome without the Sabines and their armies were defeated and their cities captured each in turn.\n\nThe wars that resulted from the mass abduction committed by the Romans came to a climax in an epic battle fought at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. After the Sabines had captured the Roman Citadel through guile, they occupied the most strategically important point in the city with the help, knowing or otherwise, of [[Tarpeia]]. After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides.\n\n[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1799]]\nIn the course of the battle, both sides found themselves on the verge of defeat, only to turn the tide back in the nick of time. Romulus himself was injured by a rock to the head. The fighting ceased only by the coming of dusk. Afterward, the Sabine women, led by the noble [[Hersilia]], convinced the two kings to make peace.\n\nAfter a ceasefire, the nations agreed to become a single kingdom under the joint rule of Romulus and Tatius.  The city was expanded and its institutions were adjusted to accommodate the new increase in population and to demonstrate their mutual goodwill.  The joint kingship lasted for four years until the death of Tatius.  During this time they conquered the [[Camerini]] and made their city a [[Romanization (cultural)|Roman colony]].\n\n====Deaths of Tatius and Romulus====\nThe two peoples are merged under a joint throne with Rome as the capital.  The Sabines and Romans alike were then declared ''[[Quirites]]'',  from the Sabine city of [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]].  To honor the Sabine women, when Romulus divided the city into 30 [[Curia|local councils]], he named them after the women.  He also recruited three new units of knights and called them [[Roman cavalry|Ramnenses Tatiensis]] (from the two kings' names).\n\nSome of Tatius' friends victimized some [[Laurentum|Laurentii]] and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus to hand the perpetrators over to them.  A group of Sabines waylayed the ambassadors as they slept on the way home.  Some escaped and when word got back to Rome, Romulus promptly turned the men responsible\u2014including one of Tatius' family members\u2014over to a new group of ambassadors.  Tatius followed the group out of the city and freed the accused men by force.  Later, while both kings were participating in a sacrifice in [[Lavinium]], Tatius was killed in retribution.\n\nThe account of [[Licinius Macer]] recounts that Tatius was killed when he went alone to try and convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed.  When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stones him to death.\n\nAfter his rule had turned more dictatorial, Romulus met his end, whether through actions divine or earthly.  According to some reports, Romulus is swept up into heaven, where he takes his place among the gods as [[Quirinus]].  Others point to the hands of the nobility, who had grown ever more resentful of their treatment by the king.\n\n==Editions==\n* Collected Works edited by [[Friedrich Sylburg]] (1536\u20131596) (parallel Greek and Latin) (Frankfurt 1586) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=PMgaIq4TBZEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false available at Google Books])\n*Complete edition by [[Johann Jakob Reiske]] (1774\u20131777){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n*''Archaeologia'' by [[A.

[[Organic compound]]s that contain the [[nitrate ester]] as a [[functional group]] (RONO<sub>2</sub>) are also called ''nitrates''.  Nitrates are common components of fertilizers and explosives.<ref name=Ullmann/>  Almost all nitrate salts are [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water]]. A common example of an inorganic nitrate salt is [[potassium nitrate]] (saltpeter).\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-with-partial-charges-2D.png|thumb|150px|The nitrate ion with the partial charges shown]]\nThe anion is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[nitric acid]], consisting of one central [[nitrogen]] [[atom]] surrounded by three identically bonded oxygen atoms in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement. The nitrate ion carries a [[formal charge]] of \u22121. This charge results from a combination formal charge in which each of the three oxygens carries a \u2212{{frac|2|3}} charge, whereas the nitrogen carries a +1 charge, all these adding up to formal charge of the polyatomic nitrate ion. This arrangement is commonly used as an example of [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]. Like the [[isoelectronic]] [[carbonate]] ion, the nitrate ion can be represented by resonance structures:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">[[Image:Nitrate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px|Canonical resonance structures for the nitrate ion]]</div>\n\n==Dietary nitrates==\nA rich source of inorganic nitrate in the human diets come from leafy green foods, such as [[spinach]] and [[arugula]]. {{chem|NO|3|\u2212}} (inorganic nitrate) is the viable active component within [[beetroot]] juice and other vegetables. Drinking water is also a dietary source.<ref name=\"Hord2009\"/>\n\nDietary nitrate supplementation delivers positive results when testing endurance exercise performance.<ref name=\"pmid27600147\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McMahon NF, Leveritt MD, Pavey TG | title = The Effect of Dietary Nitrate Supplementation on Endurance Exercise Performance in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Sports Medicine (Auckland, N.Z.) | volume = 47 | issue = 4 | pages = 735\u2013756 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27600147 | doi = 10.1007/s40279-016-0617-7 | url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:407817/uq407817_OA.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIngestion of large doses of nitrate either in the form of pure [[sodium nitrate]] or beetroot juice in young healthy individuals rapidly increases [[Blood plasma|plasma]] nitrate concentration about 2-3 fold, and this elevated nitrate concentration can be maintained for at least 2 weeks. Increased plasma nitrate stimulates the production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is important physiological signalling molecule that is used in, among other things, regulation of muscle blood flow and mitochondrial respiration.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maughan|first=Ronald J|title=Food, Nutrition and Sports Performance III|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2013|isbn=978-0-415-62792-4|location=New York|pages=63}}</ref>\n\n===Cured meats===\nNitrite consumption is primarily determined by the amount of processed meats eaten, and the concentration of nitrates in these meats.

The main nitrate fertilizers are ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Several million kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann| first1 = Wolfgang | last1 = Laue | first2 = Michael | last2 = Thiemann | first3 = Erich | last3 = Scheibler | first4 = Karl Wilhelm | last4 = Wiegand | name-list-format = vanc | title= Nitrates and Nitrites |year = 2006 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a17_265 | isbn = 978-3527306732 }}</ref>\n\nThe second major application of nitrates is as oxidizing agents, most notably in explosives where the rapid oxidation of carbon compounds liberates large volumes of gases (see [[gunpowder]] for an example). Sodium nitrate is used to remove air bubbles from molten glass and some ceramics. Mixtures of the molten salt are used to harden some metals.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n== Detection ==\nAlmost all methods for detection of nitrate rely on its conversion to nitrite followed by nitrite-specific tests. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is effected by copper-cadmium material.  The sample is introduced with a flow injection analyzer, and the resulting nitrite-containing effluent is then combined with a reagent for colorimetric or electrochemical detection.  The most popular of these assays is the [[Griess test]], whereby nitrite is converted to an deeply colored [[azo dye]], suited for UV-vis spectroscopic analysis.

[[Organic compound]]s that contain the [[nitrate ester]] as a [[functional group]] (RONO<sub>2</sub>) are also called ''nitrates''.  Nitrates are common components of fertilizers and explosives.<ref name=Ullmann/>  Almost all nitrate salts are [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water]]. A common example of an inorganic nitrate salt is [[potassium nitrate]] (saltpeter).\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-with-partial-charges-2D.png|thumb|150px|The nitrate ion with the partial charges shown]]\nThe anion is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[nitric acid]], consisting of one central [[nitrogen]] [[atom]] surrounded by three identically bonded oxygen atoms in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement. The nitrate ion carries a [[formal charge]] of \u22121. This charge results from a combination formal charge in which each of the three oxygens carries a \u2212{{frac|2|3}} charge, whereas the nitrogen carries a +1 charge, all these adding up to formal charge of the polyatomic nitrate ion. This arrangement is commonly used as an example of [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]. Like the [[isoelectronic]] [[carbonate]] ion, the nitrate ion can be represented by resonance structures:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">[[Image:Nitrate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px|Canonical resonance structures for the nitrate ion]]</div>\n\n==Dietary nitrates==\nA rich source of inorganic nitrate in the human diets come from leafy green foods, such as [[spinach]] and [[arugula]]. {{chem|NO|3|\u2212}} (inorganic nitrate) is the viable active component within [[beetroot]] juice and other vegetables.

The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is effected by copper-cadmium material.  The sample is introduced with a flow injection analyzer, and the resulting nitrite-containing effluent is then combined with a reagent for colorimetric or electrochemical detection.  The most popular of these assays is the [[Griess test]], whereby nitrite is converted to an deeply colored [[azo dye]], suited for UV-vis spectroscopic analysis. The method exploits the reactivity of nitrous acid derived from acidification of nitrite.  Nitrous acid selectively reacts with aromatic amines to give diazonium salts, which in turn couple with a second reagent to give the azo dye.

This image demonstrates the difference between how colors will look on a computer monitor (RGB) compared to how they will reproduce in a CMYK print process.]]\n\nColors can be created in [[printing]] with [[color]] spaces based on the [[CMYK color model]], using the subtractive [[primary colors]] of [[pigment]] ([[cyan|'''c'''yan]], [[magenta|'''m'''agenta]], [[yellow|'''y'''ellow]], and [[black|blac'''k''']]). To create a three-dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X [[coordinate axis|axis]], the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments.\n\nColors can be created on [[computer monitor]]s with color spaces based on the [[RGB color model]], using the additive primary colors ([[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]).  A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes.  Note that colors generated on given monitor will be limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (in a [[CRT monitor]]) or filters and backlight ([[LCD]] monitor).\n\nAnother way of creating colors on a monitor is with an [[HSL and HSV|HSL or HSV]] color space, based on [[hue]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]] (value/brightness).  With such a space, the variables are assigned to [[cylindrical coordinates]].\n\nMany color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone]], cannot be represented in this way at all.\n\n==Conversion==\n{{main|Color translation}}\nColor space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original.\n\n==RGB density==\n\nThe RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is the 24-[[bit]] implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per [[channel (digital image)|channel]]. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 \u2248 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same [[gamut]] with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different [[Color depth|bit depths]].\n\n==Lists==\n{{main|List of color spaces and their uses}}\n[[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]] was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], K\u00f6nig & Dieterici, and Abney at [[Imperial College]])<ref name=\"Wright1981\">William David Wright, ''50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer''. Die Farbe, '''29''':4/6 (1981).</ref> and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIERGB]] color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the  [[CIELUV]], [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]], and [[CIELAB]].\n\n===Generic===\n{{main|Color model}}\n[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing: Three overlapping light bulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white.]]\n[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black.]]\n\n[[RGB color space|RGB]] uses [[additive color]] mixing, because it describes what kind of ''light'' needs to be ''emitted'' to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency. Common color spaces based on the RGB model include [[sRGB]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]], [[ProPhoto RGB color space|ProPhoto RGB]], [[scRGB]], and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIE RGB]].\n\n[[CMYK]] uses [[subtractive color]] mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of [[ink]]s need to be applied so the light ''reflected'' from the [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).\n\n[[YIQ]] was formerly used in [[NTSC]] (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a [[Luma (video)|luma]] value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)<ref>Charles Poynton, \"YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video,\" [http://poynton.com/papers/YUV_and_luminance_harmful.html online],  author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, ''Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces'', Morgan\u2013Kaufmann, 2003.

The [[YDbDr]] scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. <!--\nIt would be nice if someone could find out how exactly the YDbDr color system is rotated.\n-->\n\n[[YPbPr]] is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, [[YCbCr]], used widely in [[Video compression|video]] and [[image compression]] schemes such as [[MPEG]] and [[JPEG]].\n\n[[xvYCC]] is a new international digital video color space standard published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and [[Rec. 709|BT.709]] standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards.\n\n[[HSV color space|HSV]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''v'''alue), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, '''b'''rightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived.\n\n[[HSL color space|HSL]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''l'''ightness/'''l'''uminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, '''i'''ntensity) is quite similar to [[HSV color space|HSV]], with \"lightness\" replacing \"brightness\". The difference is that the ''brightness'' of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the ''lightness'' of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.\n\n===Commercial===\n\n* [[Munsell color system]]\n* [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone Matching System (PMS)]]\n* [[Natural Color System|Natural Color System (NCS)]]\n\n===Special-purpose===\n\n* The [[RG Chromaticity]] space is used in [[computer vision]] applications.

For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute.  The [[CIELAB color space|CIE 1976 L*, a*, b* color space]] is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a [[white point]] specification to make it so.<ref>{{cite book | title = Optical Sensors and Sensing Systems for Natural Resources and Food Safety and Quality |author1=Yud-Ren Chen |author2=George E.

This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]]. The process of adding an [[ICC profile]] to a graphic or document is sometimes called ''tagging'' or ''embedding''; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document.\n\n===Conversion===\n{{main|Color translation}}\nA color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have [[gamut]] limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component ([[8-bit color]]) is used.\n\nOne part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting.\n\nOccasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, [[HSL and HSV]] spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept.\n\n===Arbitrary spaces===\nA different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the [[Pantone|Pantone Matching System]], a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Color model]]\n* [[List of colors]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Color spaces}}\n* [http://www.poynton.com/ColorFAQ.html Color FAQ], Charles Poynton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020802012056/http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/color.html Color Science], Dan Bruton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081015235156/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rgkuehni/PDFs/ColSp.pdf Color Spaces], Rolf G.

The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments.\n\nColors can be created on [[computer monitor]]s with color spaces based on the [[RGB color model]], using the additive primary colors ([[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]).  A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes.  Note that colors generated on given monitor will be limited by the reproduction medium, such as the phosphor (in a [[CRT monitor]]) or filters and backlight ([[LCD]] monitor).\n\nAnother way of creating colors on a monitor is with an [[HSL and HSV|HSL or HSV]] color space, based on [[hue]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]] (value/brightness).  With such a space, the variables are assigned to [[cylindrical coordinates]].\n\nMany color spaces can be represented as three-dimensional values in this manner, but some have more, or fewer dimensions, and some, such as [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone]], cannot be represented in this way at all.\n\n==Conversion==\n{{main|Color translation}}\nColor space conversion is the translation of the representation of a color from one basis to another. This typically occurs in the context of converting an image that is represented in one color space to another color space, the goal being to make the translated image look as similar as possible to the original.\n\n==RGB density==\n\nThe RGB color model is implemented in different ways, depending on the capabilities of the system used. By far the most common general-used incarnation {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is the 24-[[bit]] implementation, with 8 bits, or 256 discrete levels of color per [[channel (digital image)|channel]]. Any color space based on such a 24-bit RGB model is thus limited to a range of 256\u00d7256\u00d7256 \u2248 16.7 million colors. Some implementations use 16 bits per component for 48 bits total, resulting in the same [[gamut]] with a larger number of distinct colors. This is especially important when working with wide-gamut color spaces (where most of the more common colors are located relatively close together), or when a large number of digital filtering algorithms are used consecutively. The same principle applies for any color space based on the same color model, but implemented in different [[Color depth|bit depths]].\n\n==Lists==\n{{main|List of color spaces and their uses}}\n[[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]] was one of the first attempts to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception (earlier efforts were by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], K\u00f6nig & Dieterici, and Abney at [[Imperial College]])<ref name=\"Wright1981\">William David Wright, ''50 years of the 1931 CIE Standard Observer''. Die Farbe, '''29''':4/6 (1981).</ref> and it is the basis for almost all other color spaces. The [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIERGB]] color space is a linearly-related companion of CIE XYZ. Additional derivatives of CIE XYZ include the  [[CIELUV]], [[CIE 1964 color space|CIEUVW]], and [[CIELAB]].\n\n===Generic===\n{{main|Color model}}\n[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing: Three overlapping light bulbs in a vacuum, adding together to create white.]]\n[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing: Three splotches of paint on white paper, subtracting together to turn the paper black.]]\n\n[[RGB color space|RGB]] uses [[additive color]] mixing, because it describes what kind of ''light'' needs to be ''emitted'' to produce a given color. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. [[RGBA color space|RGBA]] is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency. Common color spaces based on the RGB model include [[sRGB]], [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]], [[ProPhoto RGB color space|ProPhoto RGB]], [[scRGB]], and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE RGB color space|CIE RGB]].\n\n[[CMYK]] uses [[subtractive color]] mixing used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of [[ink]]s need to be applied so the light ''reflected'' from the [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. CMYK stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK color spaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).\n\n[[YIQ]] was formerly used in [[NTSC]] (North America, Japan and elsewhere) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a [[Luma (video)|luma]] value roughly analogous to (and sometimes incorrectly identified as)<ref>Charles Poynton, \"YUV and 'luminance' considered harmful: a plea for precise terminology in video,\" [http://poynton.com/papers/YUV_and_luminance_harmful.html online],  author-edited version of Appendix A of Charles Poynton, ''Digital Video and HDTV: Algorithms and Interfaces'', Morgan\u2013Kaufmann, 2003.

The [[YDbDr]] scheme used by SECAM television is rotated in another way. <!--\nIt would be nice if someone could find out how exactly the YDbDr color system is rotated.\n-->\n\n[[YPbPr]] is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, [[YCbCr]], used widely in [[Video compression|video]] and [[image compression]] schemes such as [[MPEG]] and [[JPEG]].\n\n[[xvYCC]] is a new international digital video color space standard published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] (IEC 61966-2-4). It is based on the ITU BT.601 and [[Rec. 709|BT.709]] standards but extends the gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified in those standards.\n\n[[HSV color space|HSV]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''v'''alue), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, '''b'''rightness) is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSV is a transformation of an RGB color space, and its components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB color space from which it was derived.\n\n[[HSL color space|HSL]] ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''l'''ightness/'''l'''uminance), also known as HLS or HSI (hue, saturation, '''i'''ntensity) is quite similar to [[HSV color space|HSV]], with \"lightness\" replacing \"brightness\". The difference is that the ''brightness'' of a pure color is equal to the brightness of white, while the ''lightness'' of a pure color is equal to the lightness of a medium gray.\n\n===Commercial===\n\n* [[Munsell color system]]\n* [[Pantone#Pantone Color Matching System|Pantone Matching System (PMS)]]\n* [[Natural Color System|Natural Color System (NCS)]]\n\n===Special-purpose===\n\n* The [[RG Chromaticity]] space is used in [[computer vision]] applications.

For instance, if the red, green, and blue colors in a monitor are measured exactly, together with other properties of the monitor, then RGB values on that monitor can be considered as absolute.  The [[CIELAB color space|CIE 1976 L*, a*, b* color space]] is sometimes referred to as absolute, though it also needs a [[white point]] specification to make it so.<ref>{{cite book | title = Optical Sensors and Sensing Systems for Natural Resources and Food Safety and Quality |author1=Yud-Ren Chen |author2=George E.

This is not the only way to express an absolute color, but it is the standard in many industries. RGB colors defined by widely accepted profiles include sRGB and [[Adobe RGB color space|Adobe RGB]]. The process of adding an [[ICC profile]] to a graphic or document is sometimes called ''tagging'' or ''embedding''; tagging therefore marks the absolute meaning of colors in that graphic or document.\n\n===Conversion===\n{{main|Color translation}}\nA color in one absolute color space can be converted into another absolute color space, and back again, in general; however, some color spaces may have [[gamut]] limitations, and converting colors that lie outside that gamut will not produce correct results. There are also likely to be rounding errors, especially if the popular range of only 256 distinct values per component ([[8-bit color]]) is used.\n\nOne part of the definition of an absolute color space is the viewing conditions. The same color, viewed under different natural or artificial lighting conditions, will look different. Those involved professionally with color matching may use viewing rooms, lit by standardized lighting.\n\nOccasionally, there are precise rules for converting between non-absolute color spaces. For example, [[HSL and HSV]] spaces are defined as mappings of RGB. Both are non-absolute, but the conversion between them should maintain the same color. However, in general, converting between two non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to [[CMYK color model|CMYK]]) or between absolute and non-absolute color spaces (for example, RGB to L*a*b*) is almost a meaningless concept.\n\n===Arbitrary spaces===\nA different method of defining absolute color spaces is familiar to many consumers as the swatch card, used to select paint, fabrics, and the like. This is a way of agreeing a color between two parties. A more standardized method of defining absolute colors is the [[Pantone|Pantone Matching System]], a proprietary system that includes swatch cards and recipes that commercial printers can use to make inks that are a particular color.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Color theory]]\n* [[Color model]]\n* [[List of colors]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Color spaces}}\n* [http://www.poynton.com/ColorFAQ.html Color FAQ], Charles Poynton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020802012056/http://www.physics.sfasu.edu/astro/color.html Color Science], Dan Bruton\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081015235156/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rgkuehni/PDFs/ColSp.pdf Color Spaces], Rolf G.
