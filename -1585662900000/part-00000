The game can be played in [[single-player]] mode against the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|video game AI]] or in [[multiplayer]] mode against players on the [[Internet]] or in a [[local area network]]. It is a popular platform for [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] developers, with many released modifications that alter the gameplay and theme.\n\nIn-game, players assume the role of one of five classes of [[infantry]]: Scout, Assault, Anti-Tank, Medic, and Engineer. Players also have the ability to fly various [[World War II]] [[fighter aircraft]] and [[bomber]]s, navigate [[capital ship]]s, [[submarine]]s, and [[aircraft carrier]]s, man [[coastal artillery]] defenses, drive [[tank]]s, [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s and [[jeep]]s, and take control of [[anti-aircraft guns]] and mounted [[machine gun]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=BattleField 1942 Photo Gallery |url=http://b-42.webs.com/ |accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nEach battle takes place on one of several maps located in a variety of places and famous battlefields in all of the major theaters of World War II: the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], [[European Theater of World War II|European]], [[North African campaign|North African]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]], and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] Fronts. Combat is between the [[Axis Power]]s and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The location determines which nation-specific armies are used (for example, on the [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island]] map, it is [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japan]] versus the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States]], while on the [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] map, it is [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] versus the [[British Armed Forces|United Kingdom]]). The maps in ''Battlefield 1942'' are based on real battles and are somewhat realistically portrayed.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:BF1942 screencap2.jpg|thumb|left|''Battlefield 1942'' features combat both as infantry and in vehicles]]\n\nThe gameplay of ''Battlefield 1942'' generally has a more [[Co-operative gameplay|co-operative]] focus than previous games of this nature, as it is not only important to kill the opposition but to also hold certain \"control points\" around the map. Capturing control points allows the team to reinforce itself by enabling players and vehicles to spawn in a given area. Additionally, capturing and controlling control points also reduces enemy reinforcements. ''Battlefield 1942'' was one of the first mainstream games to represent a dramatic shift in FPS game play mentality not only favoring individualism, but simultaneously encouraging teamwork and coordination.\n\nThe default game play mode, Conquest, centers on the capture and control of control points; once a team captures a control point, its members can [[respawn]] from it. When a team loses control of all their control points, they cannot respawn. And if no one is alive, the team with no \"spawn\" points or the popular term \"tickets\" loses.\n\nGames are composed of rounds. A team wins the round when the other team runs out of tickets. A team loses tickets when its members are killed, but also when the other team holds a majority of the capture points on the map (typically when one team holds more capture points than the other). Therefore, sometimes the winning team must hunt down straggling or hiding enemy forces at the end of a round.\n\nSpawn tickets also play a vital role in the success of both teams. Every time a player on a team dies and respawns, their team loses one ticket. Every team starts each round with between 150 and 300 tickets, depending on the team's role (e.g., defense). Teams also gradually lose tickets depending on how many spawn points they control. As a general rule, the fewer spawn points controlled by a team, the more tickets they lose. For a team of 32 on a 64 player map, with 150 tickets, this means a little less than 5 re spawns or deaths on average for every player if they hold their starting spawn points.\n\n=== Roles ===\nThe player can choose to play as either the Allied team or the Axis team. The Allies consists of the United States, the United Kingdom and the [[Soviet Union]], while the Axis consists of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Regardless of which nation is chosen by the player, there are five different roles of infantry that the player can assume the role: [[Scout Sniper|Scout]], Assault, [[Combat Medic|Medic]], Anti-tank, and [[Combat Engineer|Engineer]].\n\nEach role has its own strength and weakness. For example, the scout role has long-range surveillance, high [[stopping power]] and the ability to provide spotting for artillery shelling against an enemy position (unlike other games with a similar feature, other player characters must also supply the artillery fire); however, the [[sniper rifle]] is not designed to be used in close-quarter combat and players frequently treat this role as just a plain [[sniper]] role by not providing [[Spotter (sniping)|spotting]] for artillery. Assault is the standard role, and provides very aggressive firepower. The Anti-tank role specializes against vehicles and tanks, but their main weapon is inaccurate against enemy infantry. The Medic role has the ability to heal (himself and other players), but his [[sub-machine gun]] has less stopping power than the Assault's weapons. The Engineer has the ability to repair damaged vehicles and stationary weapons, and they also have the ability to deploy [[Composition C|explosives]], which are highly effective against both enemy infantry and vehicles, and [[land mine]]s, which destroy enemy vehicles on contact.\n\n== Development ==\nOriginally proposed by [[EA DICE|DICE]] as a [[GameCube]] exclusive to Nintendo. Though satisfied with the proposal, negotiations never made it further because Nintendo had no online strategy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/28480/battlefield-could-have-been-exclusive-to-gamecube|title=Battlefield Could Have Been Exclusive to GameCube|last=Ronaghan|first=Neal|website=Nintendo World Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211113436/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/28480/battlefield-could-have-been-exclusive-to-gamecube|archive-date=February 11, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The game was developed by a team of 14 people at [[Digital Illusions]].<ref>{{cite web |title=E3 2016: How EA Plans To Discover The Next Rocket League |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/15/e3-2016-how-ea-plans-to-discover-the-next-rocket-league |first=Brian |last=Albert |website=[[IGN]] |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> ''Battlefield 1942'' was built on the formula of the less well-known and successful ''[[Codename Eagle]]'' video game, set in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] [[World War I]].

Most did not progress very far and were abandoned without ever producing a public release.  Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen while others are total conversions that modify content and gameplay extensively. A few mods have become popular and are nearly games in their own right.  Early modifications of Battlefield 1942 were produced without a [[software development kit|SDK]].  Later a \"Mod Development Kit\", Battlefield Mod Development Toolkit, was produced by EA to help development of mods. With the release of the Battlefield 1942 sequel ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' and ''[[Battlefield 2]]'', some mods have released a new version or have continued development with that game.  ''Battlefield Vietnam'' uses an updated version of the ''Refractor 2'' [[game engine]]. Some mods have switched to the computer games ''[[S\u00f6ldner: Secret Wars]]'', ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' while others were releasing a standalone game after completed mod development for Battlefield 1942 (Eve of Destruction - REDUX<ref>{{cite web |title=Eve of Destruction - REDUX|url=http://www.eod-game.com/ |publisher=Agger Interactive}}</ref> and FinnWars<ref>{{cite web |title=FinnWars (2015)|url=http://www.finnwars.com/ |publisher=Iceflake Studios, Ltd}}</ref>).\n\n* ''Battlefield Interstate 1982'', mentioned in ''1UP'' ''\"Free PC Games\"'' December 2003 article.

[[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[EA DICE|Digital Illusions Creative Entertainment]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The game can be played in [[single-player]] mode against the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|video game AI]] or in [[multiplayer]] mode against players on the [[Internet]] or in a [[local area network]]. It is a popular platform for [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] developers, with many released modifications that alter the gameplay and theme.\n\nIn-game, players assume the role of one of five classes of [[infantry]]: Scout, Assault, Anti-Tank, Medic, and Engineer. Players also have the ability to fly various [[World War II]] [[fighter aircraft]] and [[bomber]]s, navigate [[capital ship]]s, [[submarine]]s, and [[aircraft carrier]]s, man [[coastal artillery]] defenses, drive [[tank]]s, [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s and [[jeep]]s, and take control of [[anti-aircraft guns]] and mounted [[machine gun]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=BattleField 1942 Photo Gallery |url=http://b-42.webs.com/ |accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nEach battle takes place on one of several maps located in a variety of places and famous battlefields in all of the major theaters of World War II: the [[Pacific War|Pacific]], [[European Theater of World War II|European]], [[North African campaign|North African]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]], and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] Fronts. Combat is between the [[Axis Power]]s and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The location determines which nation-specific armies are used (for example, on the [[Battle of Wake Island|Wake Island]] map, it is [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japan]] versus the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States]], while on the [[Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] map, it is [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] versus the [[British Armed Forces|United Kingdom]]). The maps in ''Battlefield 1942'' are based on real battles and are somewhat realistically portrayed.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:BF1942 screencap2.jpg|thumb|left|''Battlefield 1942'' features combat both as infantry and in vehicles]]\n\nThe gameplay of ''Battlefield 1942'' generally has a more [[Co-operative gameplay|co-operative]] focus than previous games of this nature, as it is not only important to kill the opposition but to also hold certain \"control points\" around the map. Capturing control points allows the team to reinforce itself by enabling players and vehicles to spawn in a given area. Additionally, capturing and controlling control points also reduces enemy reinforcements. ''Battlefield 1942'' was one of the first mainstream games to represent a dramatic shift in FPS game play mentality not only favoring individualism, but simultaneously encouraging teamwork and coordination.\n\nThe default game play mode, Conquest, centers on the capture and control of control points; once a team captures a control point, its members can [[respawn]] from it. When a team loses control of all their control points, they cannot respawn. And if no one is alive, the team with no \"spawn\" points or the popular term \"tickets\" loses.\n\nGames are composed of rounds. A team wins the round when the other team runs out of tickets. A team loses tickets when its members are killed, but also when the other team holds a majority of the capture points on the map (typically when one team holds more capture points than the other). Therefore, sometimes the winning team must hunt down straggling or hiding enemy forces at the end of a round.\n\nSpawn tickets also play a vital role in the success of both teams. Every time a player on a team dies and respawns, their team loses one ticket. Every team starts each round with between 150 and 300 tickets, depending on the team's role (e.g., defense). Teams also gradually lose tickets depending on how many spawn points they control. As a general rule, the fewer spawn points controlled by a team, the more tickets they lose. For a team of 32 on a 64 player map, with 150 tickets, this means a little less than 5 re spawns or deaths on average for every player if they hold their starting spawn points.\n\n=== Roles ===\nThe player can choose to play as either the Allied team or the Axis team. The Allies consists of the United States, the United Kingdom and the [[Soviet Union]], while the Axis consists of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Regardless of which nation is chosen by the player, there are five different roles of infantry that the player can assume the role: [[Scout Sniper|Scout]], Assault, [[Combat Medic|Medic]], Anti-tank, and [[Combat Engineer|Engineer]].\n\nEach role has its own strength and weakness. For example, the scout role has long-range surveillance, high [[stopping power]] and the ability to provide spotting for artillery shelling against an enemy position (unlike other games with a similar feature, other player characters must also supply the artillery fire); however, the [[sniper rifle]] is not designed to be used in close-quarter combat and players frequently treat this role as just a plain [[sniper]] role by not providing [[Spotter (sniping)|spotting]] for artillery. Assault is the standard role, and provides very aggressive firepower. The Anti-tank role specializes against vehicles and tanks, but their main weapon is inaccurate against enemy infantry. The Medic role has the ability to heal (himself and other players), but his [[sub-machine gun]] has less stopping power than the Assault's weapons. The Engineer has the ability to repair damaged vehicles and stationary weapons, and they also have the ability to deploy [[Composition C|explosives]], which are highly effective against both enemy infantry and vehicles, and [[land mine]]s, which destroy enemy vehicles on contact.\n\n== Development ==\nOriginally proposed by [[EA DICE|DICE]] as a [[GameCube]] exclusive to Nintendo. Though satisfied with the proposal, negotiations never made it further because Nintendo had no online strategy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/28480/battlefield-could-have-been-exclusive-to-gamecube|title=Battlefield Could Have Been Exclusive to GameCube|last=Ronaghan|first=Neal|website=Nintendo World Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211113436/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/28480/battlefield-could-have-been-exclusive-to-gamecube|archive-date=February 11, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The game was developed by a team of 14 people at [[Digital Illusions]].<ref>{{cite web |title=E3 2016: How EA Plans To Discover The Next Rocket League |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/15/e3-2016-how-ea-plans-to-discover-the-next-rocket-league |first=Brian |last=Albert |website=[[IGN]] |date=15 June 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> ''Battlefield 1942'' was built on the formula of the less well-known and successful ''[[Codename Eagle]]'' video game, set in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] [[World War I]].

Most did not progress very far and were abandoned without ever producing a public release.  Some are very limited and just include some gameplay changes or even a different loading screen while others are total conversions that modify content and gameplay extensively. A few mods have become popular and are nearly games in their own right.  Early modifications of Battlefield 1942 were produced without a [[software development kit|SDK]].  Later a \"Mod Development Kit\", Battlefield Mod Development Toolkit, was produced by EA to help development of mods. With the release of the Battlefield 1942 sequel ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' and ''[[Battlefield 2]]'', some mods have released a new version or have continued development with that game.  ''Battlefield Vietnam'' uses an updated version of the ''Refractor 2'' [[game engine]]. Some mods have switched to the computer games ''[[S\u00f6ldner: Secret Wars]]'', ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' while others were releasing a standalone game after completed mod development for Battlefield 1942 (Eve of Destruction - REDUX<ref>{{cite web |title=Eve of Destruction - REDUX|url=http://www.eod-game.com/ |publisher=Agger Interactive}}</ref> and FinnWars<ref>{{cite web |title=FinnWars (2015)|url=http://www.finnwars.com/ |publisher=Iceflake Studios, Ltd}}</ref>).\n\n* ''Battlefield Interstate 1982'', mentioned in ''1UP'' ''\"Free PC Games\"'' December 2003 article.

While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively, adults may experience an inability to relax, or they talk excessively in social situations. Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively, display sensation-seeking behavior, and be short-tempered. Addictive behavior such as [[substance abuse]] and gambling are common. The DSM-V criteria do specifically deal with adults, unlike those in DSM-IV, which were criticized for not being appropriate for adults; those who presented differently may lead to the claim that they outgrew the diagnosis.<ref name=\"Kooij-2010\"/>\n\nHaving ADHD symptoms since childhood is usually required to be diagnosed with adult ADHD. However, a proportion of adults who meet criteria for ADHD would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children.

For instance, ''[[Feldj\u00e4ger]]''  was the name given by the [[Prussian Army]] to scouts and runners. During the 20th century, ''J\u00e4ger'' became the German word for [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] aircraft, while ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' was the name adopted for [[tank destroyer]]s. Conversely, in the modern ''[[Bundeswehr|German army]]'' (''Bundeswehr''), ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' is the name given to [[military police]].\n\n''J\u00e4ger'', in its original sense of light infantry, is usually translated into English as:\n\n* \"'''[[rifleman]]'''\" (in an infantry role) or \"'''Rifles'''\" (in regimental names) and; \n* \"'''[[United States Army Rangers#Colonial period|ranger]]'''\" (especially in [[North American English]]; see below).\n\nIn English ''J\u00e4ger'' is often written as ''jaeger'' (both pl. and sgl.) or anglicised as ''jager'' (pl. ''jagers'') to avoid the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]].\n\n== Age of Enlightenment (18th century) ==\n[[image:Franz Rudolf Frisching.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Rudolf Frisching]] in the uniform of an officer of the [[Bernese]] ''J\u00e4ger'' Corps with his [[Schweizerischer Niederlaufhund]], painted by [[Jean Preudhomme]] in 1785]]\n\nAccording to a popular theory, the earliest known ''J\u00e4ger'' unit was a company formed in about 1631 in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], under [[William V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]].  Wilhelm supposedly formed an elite light infantry unit for the [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian Army]], around a core drawn from his personal staff of [[gamekeeper]]s (''Revierj\u00e4ger''; \"game preserve hunter\"), [[forest ranger]]s and/or professional hunters.\n\nHowever, it was not until the first half of the 18th century that the widespread recruitment began in various German states of gamekeepers, huntsmen and foresters employed on crown estates or those of noble landowners, for specialized units of riflemen and skirmishers.<ref>Christopher Duffy, ''The Military Experience in the Age of Reason'' ({{ISBN|1-85326-690-6}}), page 272</ref>\n\nBy the early 19th century, because of their civilian occupations, ''J\u00e4ger'' were usually familiar with the first true rifles, rather than the [[musket]]s used by regular infantry. While early [[long rifle]]s took longer to load than the [[smoothbore]] musket of the line infantry, they also had greater range and accuracy. The men were drawn from a \"well-esteemed class\".<ref>General [[Martin Ernst von Schlieffen]] quoted in R. Atwood's \"The Hessians\" Mercenaries from Hessen-Kassel in the American Revolution\", Cambridge 1980</ref> The ''J\u00e4ger'' became primarily used for [[reconnaissance]], [[skirmishers|skirmishing]] or screening bodies of heavier troops.\n\n[[Prussia]], Hesse, [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Russian Empire]] and many smaller states raised ''J\u00e4ger''-type small units during the [[Seven Years' War]] and thereafter. Initially these specialist units were formed for the duration of a particular campaign and thereafter disbanded. However, Russia maintained its ''J\u00e4ger'' companies on a permanent basis for frontier service against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Christopher Duffy, pages 272\u2013273 \"The Military Experience in the Age of Reason\", {{ISBN|1-85326-690-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Prussian ''J\u00e4ger'' corps of Frederick the Great dated back to a mounted detachment raised in November 1740 and quickly expanded to two squadrons. Employed in wartime as guides and scouts, they eventually proved a useful [[border guard|frontier guard]] tasked with catching deserters and seizing contraband. After 1744, they were joined by an infantry branch of foot ''J\u00e4gers'', initially divided into independent companies and then brought together as a full regiment by 1784.<ref>Philip Haythornthwaite, pages 13\u201314 \"Frederick the Great's Army \u2013 Specialist Troops\", {{ISBN|1-85532-225-0}}</ref> \nFor fighting at close quarters the ''J\u00e4ger'' carried a straight-bladed [[hunting dagger]] (''Hirschf\u00e4nger''), a short sabre or a [[falchion]].\n\nWhile the English term \"ranger\" is older, emerging during the 17th century to describe highly-mobile (\"ranging\") foot and [[mounted infantry]] units in [[British North America]], it became strongly associated with ''J\u00e4ger'' during the late 18th century, when German-speaking [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian regiments]] served as part of the [[British Army]] in North America.\n\n== Napoleonic era ==\nInterest in [[light infantry]] tactics increased across Europe after the [[Battle of Valmy]], where the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[line infantry]] proved unable to break through the [[Tirailleur|French sharpshooters]]. Initially soldiers were drawn directly from the line infantry to fight as skirmishers instead, but in time many [[German language|German-speaking]] states adopted ''J\u00e4ger'' to fulfill this role. In theory the ''J\u00e4ger'' operated in pairs to protect each other while reloading, and remained within 100\u2013200 yards of close-order infantry on which they could fall back if they were endangered by cavalry or driven off by infantry. However, it was admitted that, due to the difficulty of controlling troops spread out in open-order and in the thick of battle, these guidelines might not always be followed. ''J\u00e4ger'' were allowed to act with a certain amount of initiative on the battlefield, unlike [[line infantry]] who were rigidly drilled and kept under tight control by their officers. For this reason, it was the most energetic and daring soldiers who were selected to become a ''J\u00e4ger''.\n\nThe Prussians in particular developed their light infantry tactics both in theory and in practice during the early Napoleonic era. There was much disagreement over how much emphasis should be placed on ''J\u00e4gers'', though, and reform was for the most part at the regimental level by more energetic commanders such as [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]]. It was not until the reorganization of the army led by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] that the ''J\u00e4ger'' corps was strengthened on a national level. Having suffered crippling defeats at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]] and [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], the Prussian army undertook major reforms, in many ways following the example of the [[French Revolutionary Army]], becoming a nationalized force. Foreign mercenaries were removed, corporal punishment became rare (and was abolished for ''J\u00e4ger'' troops), and promotions were based on [[Meritocracy|merit]] rather than [[nobility]]. New volunteers from a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] background were organized to resist [[Napoleon]]'s invasion and occupation of Central Europe. Continuing the earlier traditions, in Prussia these ''J\u00e4ger'' were patriotic volunteers, bearing the cost of their weapons and uniforms at their own expense or with the help of contributions from friends and neighbours, and often organizing themselves into clubs and leagues. As one of the early adopters of skirmisher tactics, Yorck became inspector-general of the light infantry in Prussia and oversaw the increase and improvement of the new ''J\u00e4ger'' troops during the years of peace after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]]. The most famous of the Prussian ''J\u00e4ger'' were the volunteers of the [[L\u00fctzow Free Corps]].\n\nThe Prussian army gained experience as an auxiliary force in the [[French invasion of Russia]], where the ''J\u00e4ger'' were often used on the strategic level to provide support and cover for the rest of the army. They managed to escape the fate of Napoleon's French soldiers after Yorck negotiated a [[Convention of Tauroggen|battlefield truce]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] when, during a rear-guard action, the French withdrew and left Yorck's troops isolated. In the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] that immediately followed, the ''J\u00e4ger'' of the various armies performed well against Napoleon's forces, and Prussian ''J\u00e4ger'' played a significant role in the battles of the Waterloo campaign, holding off [[Emmanuel de Grouchy|Grouchy's]] corps at the [[Battle of Wavre]].\n\nThe resistance against Napoleon exacted a high toll of military casualties, officers in particular. This in combination with a shift towards a meritocratic officer corps led to many promotions within the ranks. By the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], many of the [[Military rank#Company grade or junior officers|junior officers]] in the Germanic states' armies were former ''J\u00e4ger'' soldiers who had been promoted through the ranks.\n\n== Prior to First World War==\nBy the early twentieth century, ''J\u00e4ger'' units were part of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian, Swedish, Dutch and Norwegian armies. They corresponded to the [[rifle]]s, [[light infantry]], ''[[chasseur]]s \u00e0 pied'' or ''[[bersaglieri]]'' units of the British, French, Italian and other armies. While such units still enjoyed considerable prestige and high ''esprit de corps'', their training, equipment and tactical roles had for the most part become aligned with those of the line infantry of their respective armies.\n\n===J\u00e4ger rank===\n''J\u00e4ger'' was in Austria and Germany until 1918 the lowest rank of the J\u00e4ger regiments, equivalent to private or soldier.\n\nOther follows private [[Gemeiner]] ranks - ''Musketier'' ([[musketeer]]), ''[[Grenadier]]'', ''F\u00fcsilier'' ([[fusilier]]), ''Infanterist'' ([[infantry]]man), ''Dragoner'' (en: [[dragoon#Dragoner rank|dragoon]]), ''Husar'' ([[hussar]]), ''Ulan'' ([[uhlan]]), ''Kanonier'', [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), ''Pionier'' ([[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]), ''Sanit\u00e4tssoldat'' ([[combat medic]]), ''Trainsoldat'' ([[Train (military)|trainman]])\n\n===Imperial Germany===\n[[File:J\u00e4gerpatrouille.

One ''J\u00e4ger'' battalion, the ''Gro\u00dfherzoglich Mecklenburgisches J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 14'', was from the [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Another, ''Westf\u00e4lisches J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 7'', known as the \"B\u00fcckeburg J\u00e4gers\", was raised in the [[Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe]], whose capital was [[B\u00fcckeburg]]. The other ten were from Prussian lands. In addition, another Prussian Guard unit, the [[Guards Rifles Battalion]], though not designated ''J\u00e4ger'', was a ''J\u00e4ger'' formation. Its origins were in a French ''chasseur'' battalion of the Napoleonic era, and its troops wore the shako and green tunic of the ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions.<ref>H.

S\u00e4chsisches 1. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 12'' and ''Kgl. S\u00e4chsisches 2. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 13''. The Saxon ''J\u00e4ger'' had a number of dress distinctions \u2013 notably tunics of a darker green than the Prussian colour, black facings instead of red and a black buffalo-hair plume buckled to the side of the shako. The autonomous Royal Bavarian Army provided a further two ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions, ''Kgl. Bayerisches 1. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon'' and ''Kgl. Bayerisches 2. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon'', who wore the light blue of Bavarian infantry with green facings.<ref>H.

In September 1914, an additional twelve reserve ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions were raised (ten Prussian and two Saxon). In May 1915, the German Army began joining the ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions to form ''J\u00e4ger'' regiments, and in late 1917, the ''Deutsche J\u00e4ger-Division'' was formed.\n\nDuring the early stages of [[World War I]], the German ''J\u00e4ger'' maintained their traditional role as skirmishers and scouts, often in conjunction with cavalry units. With the advent of trench warfare, they were committed to an ordinary infantry role, integrated into divisions and lost their status as independent units. Cyclist ''J\u00e4ger'' served in the Balkan and Russian theatres of war, while Wurttemberg and Bavaria raised Ski-''J\u00e4ger'' during the winter of 1914\u201315. Another specialist formation was the ''J\u00e4ger'' Storm Companies, serving as trench raiders during 1917\u20131918.\n\n====Mounted ''J\u00e4ger''====\nIn 1897, existing dispatch rider units within the Prussian Army were converted to ''Detachments J\u00e4ger' zu Pferde''. Further mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' squadrons were subsequently raised, including short-lived Bavarian and Saxon detachments. After 1901, the original dispatch carrying role of the mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' were discontinued. Five newly raised squadrons were brought together to form a combined Mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' Regiment the same year. The experiment proved a successful one and between 1905 and 1913 a further 13 mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' regiments were created.<ref>Dr Ernst Aichner, page 594 ''The German Cavalry from 1871 to 1914'', {{ISBN|3-902526-07-6}}</ref>\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:Franz Josef I in Kaiserj\u00e4geruniform.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] in the parade dress of the ''Kaiserj\u00e4ger'' 1879]]\nThe [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1914 included four regiments of ''Tiroler [[Kaiserj\u00e4ger]]'', descended from a unit first raised in 1801. There were also 29 battalions of ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' recruited from different regions across the Empire (including 7 Hungarian, 5 Bohemian and 4 Galician battalions) and one Bosnian-Herzegovinian ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' Battalion (''Bosnisch-hercegovinisches Feldj\u00e4gerbataillon''). All wore [[pike grey]] uniforms faced in green, with a form of [[bowler hat]] carrying a distinctive plume of dark green feathers. The exception was the [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry|Bosnian-Herzegovinian Feldj\u00e4ger Battalion]] which wore the [[Fez (clothing)|fez]]. Later, an additional three Feldj\u00e4ger battalions and seven Bosnian-Herzegovinian Feldj\u00e4ger Battalions were formed.\n\n==Second World War Germany ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-586-2221-14, Frankreich, Normandie, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.jpg|thumb|right|German ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroopers) in Normandy June 1944, wearing camouflage smocks]]\nAfter the First World War, the ''J\u00e4ger'' units of the Imperial German Army were disbanded, but their traditions were carried by infantry regiments of the 100,000-man [[Reichswehr]] of the [[Weimar Republic]]. After the Nazis came to power in 1933 and the rearmament of Germany began, the new [[Wehrmacht]] revived the name ''J\u00e4ger'' for various types of units:\n\n* In 1935, the first specialized mountain infantry units were formed; their regiments and battalions were designated ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' (\"mountain infantry\" \u2013 ''Gebirge'' is German for \"mountain range\"). More specialized units, such as the ''Hochgebirgs-J\u00e4ger-Bataillone'', for use in high-Alpine conditions, were also developed. The Waffen SS raised a \"[[24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstj\u00e4ger|Karstj\u00e4ger]]\" Division.\n* When the [[Luftwaffe]] began forming parachute units in the late-1930s, the first parachute regiment was designated ''Fallschirm-J\u00e4ger-Regiment 1''. German paratroopers became known as ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (''Fallschirm'' is German for \"parachute\"). At first, ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' was applied only to genuine airborne-qualified troops, but the term was retained for ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' regiments and divisions even after they began operating as regular infantry. A number of ''[[Luftwaffe Field Division|Luftwaffe Feld-Divisionen]]'' (\"field divisions\"), regular ground combat units raised by the Luftwaffe, also used the term ''Luftwaffen-J\u00e4ger-Regiment'' for their infantry regiments. Many of these were later taken over by the army but retained the name ''J\u00e4ger-Regiment''.\n* Two ''Skij\u00e4ger'' regiments were formed in 1943 as part of ''Skij\u00e4ger-Brigade'' (later a ''Skij\u00e4ger-Division'').\n* Certain infantry divisions were raised as \"light infantry divisions\" (''leichte Infanterie-Divisionen'') in late 1940. They were raised to operate in rough terrain, especially in southeastern Europe. Their infantry regiments were called ''J\u00e4ger-Regimenter'', and in 1942 the light and light infantry divisions were renamed ''J\u00e4ger'' divisions.\n* The antitank units of German divisions, originally called ''Panzer-Abwehr-Abteilungen'' (\"anti-tank battalions\"), began in 1940 to be redesignated as ''Panzerj\u00e4ger-Abteilungen'', (literally \"tank hunter battalions\"). These were equipped with towed or self-propelled guns (often the ad hoc mounting of an antitank gun on a captured or obsolete tank chassis). As the war progressed, some ''Panzerj\u00e4ger-Abteilungen'' were fully equipped with specialized [[tank destroyers]], initially known as ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' (tank hunters), and later by 1943 as ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'' (\"hunting tank\") with enclosed, armored [[casemate]] superstructures.\n* The military police of the Wehrmacht was known as the ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]''. In December 1943, a new force of military police, directly subordinated to the Armed Forces High Command, was formed. Its units were designated ''Feldj\u00e4ger-Kommandos'' with subordinated ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' battalions and regiments. These were known collectively as the ''[[Feldj\u00e4gerkorps]]''. The name was taken from the ''Reitendes Feldj\u00e4gerkorps'', a Prussian Army [[military police]]-type unit directly under the General Staff.\n\n== After Second World War==\n\n===Germany===\n'''''J\u00e4ger''''' (short: '''''Jg'''''; English: hunter) is the lowest [[Soldat (rank)|soldier rank]] of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted men]] of the modern day's German [[Bundeswehr]] for soldiers light infantry, paratroopers and mountain troops.

These may vary according to the service branch (Heer, Luftwaffe, Bundeswehr, medical service etc.). Other examples are [[Grenadier]] for mechanized infantrymen and ''Kanonier'' for artillerymen.\n\nThe German ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' rejected the term ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'' and instead kept the term ''[[Feldj\u00e4ger]]'' for its military police units. To emphasize the traditional connection with the Prussian ''Reitendes Feldj\u00e4gerkorps'', rather than the ''Wehrmacht'' military police units, the ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' of the ''Bundeswehr'' wear a red beret with star badge (the ''[[Gardestern]]'') of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]], Prussia's highest chivalric order. The ''Reitendes Feldj\u00e4gerkorps'' had been granted the right to wear the ''Gardestern'' in 1847.\n\nIn addition, at certain periods, light infantry units of the ''Bundeswehr'' were designated as ''J\u00e4ger'', and wore a green beret with a beret badge patterned after the ''J\u00e4ger'' sleeve patch of the ''Wehrmacht'' ''J\u00e4ger'' units. Each battalion of ''J\u00e4ger'', ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' and ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'', has a \"heavy company\" of Wiesel weapon-carriers equipped with 20&nbsp;mm cannon, TOW launchers or 120&nbsp;mm mortars.\n\nThe modern ''J\u00e4ger''-type infantry units are distinguished as follows:\n* ''J\u00e4ger'' \u2013 light infantry specialized for assault and defense operations in urban and rugged terrain, in the context of mechanised combat troops. They can used for air-mobile/air-assault operations (heliborne). They wear a green beret with a golden badge displaying oak leaves surrounded by a braided chord.\n* ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' \u2013 \"Airborne Rangers\" \u2013 paratroopers, light airborne infantry units.  As above. They wear a Bordeaux beret with a badge displaying an attacking eagle.\n* ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' \u2013 \"Mountain Rangers\" \u2013 light infantry for mountain terran, rugged an urban terrain, with special equipment for winter warfare. Instead of a beret, they wear a grey ''Bergm\u00fctze'' mountain cap - a type of stiff forage cap \u2013 see {{illm|Bergm\u00fctze|de|Bergm%C3%BCtze}} (German)) with [[Leontopodium alpinum#Symbolic uses|Edelweiss insignia]].\n* in differnt The [[Wachbataillon]] (Guard battalion at the Ministry of Defence) is named for there soldiers ''Grenadier''.\nWith a former restructuring of the German Army, only one new air-mobile regiment, ''J\u00e4gerregiment'' 1 ([[Air Assault Infantry Regiment 1 (Bundeswehr)|JgRgt 1]]), two battalions, ''J\u00e4gerbataillon'' 291 (JgBtl 291) and ''J\u00e4gerbataillon'' 292 (JgBtl 292) (both battalions are part of the [[Franco-German Brigade]]) and two other new bataillons of the mechanised brigades are the only regular ''J\u00e4ger'' retained. On the other hand, ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' has become the most important infantry type, due to its versatility and the nature of modern-day peacekeeping missions abroad.\n\nWith the last restructuring of the German Army, J\u00e4gerregiment 1 was reduced to J\u00e4gerbataillon 1 (JgBtl 1), not air-mobile any longer. Two new battalions were established: J\u00e4gerbataillon 91 and J\u00e4gerbataillon 413.\n;See also:\n{{Main|Ranks of the German Bundeswehr|Rank insignia of the German Bundeswehr}}\n\n===Austria===\nIn the Austrian ''[[Military of Austria|Bundesheer]]'', ''J\u00e4ger'' is used as the generic term for most infantry soldiers (armored infantrymen are known as ''Panzergrenadiere'', as in the German ''Bundeswehr''). In the Austrian ''Bundesheer'', the special forces are called ''Jagdkommando'' (lit.

In the Finnish Border Guards, the private rank is called ''rajaj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri'' (\"Border J\u00e4ger\").\n\nThe rank pays homage to the role of the World War I era [[J\u00e4ger Movement|''J\u00e4ger'' Movement]] in securing Finnish Independence. In general usage, \n\nBesides riflemen, specialists such as drivers, medics, military police, mortar squad members in the above mentioned infantry formations usually hold the rank of ''J\u00e4ger''. In units other than infantry, equivalent ranks such as ''tykkimies'' (\"Gunner\") or ''viestimies'' (\"Signalist\") are used (see [[Finnish military ranks]]). Additionally, in all other Navy units except the Uusimaa Brigade, the private rank is ''matruusi'' (\"Sailor\"). \n\nThe old infantry rank of ''sotamies'' (\"private\", lit. \"soldier\") is no longer used in peacetime training units, but remains reserved for war-time infantry usage.\n\n'''J\u00e4ger as Troop Type indicator'''<br>\n\nThe word J\u00e4ger is also used to indicate a) in general the best trained & equipped combat arms troops of the Defence Forces and b) specifically for the following troops. \n\n''Finnish Army''\n* J\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rijoukot (\"J\u00e4ger Troops\") \u2013 refers to any 1st line infantry units with top-of-the-line equipment\n* Panssarij\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Armoured or Panzer J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 mechanized infantry of the Armoured Brigade\n* Kaartinj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Guards J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 infantry of the Guards J\u00e4ger Regt, specializing in MOUT\n* Laskuvarjoj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Parachute J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 rangers / paratroopers of the Utti J\u00e4ger Regt (conscripts)\n* Erikoisj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Special J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 the Army's Special Forces, part of the Utti J\u00e4ger Regt (career military)\n\n''Finnish Navy''\n* Rannikkoj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Coastal J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 Marines of the Uusimaa Brigade\n\n''Border Guards''\n* Rajaj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Border J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 rangers / light infantry of the Border Guard\n* Erikoisrajaj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Special Border J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 Special Operations Capable forces within the Border Guard\n\nIn addition to the above, some non-infantry units use the word J\u00e4ger in their name to show direct lineage to the original J\u00e4ger Movement.\n\n===Norway===\n''Jeger'' is the general term indicating highly trained soldiers and operators capable of conducting military [[ISTAR]] (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance) operations independently behind enemy lines. There are several units using the ''jeger'' term, both conventional forces and special operation forces.\n\nThe SOF units include:\n* [[Marinejegerkommandoen]] (Navy Special Operation Command) \u2013 the SOF operators are referred to as ''Marinejeger'' (Navy Ranger) or ''Spesialb\u00e5toperat\u00f8r'' (Special Boat Operator) and is highly trained in naval SOF and ISTAR operations.\n* [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] (Armed Forces' Special Command) \u2013 this unit has several subcategories of ''jegers'': ''Spesialjeger'' (Special Ranger) \u2013 SOF operators trained highly for airborne SOF and ISTAR operations. ''Fallskjermjeger'' (Parachute Ranger) \u2013 conscript soldiers highly trained for raid and airborne ISTAR operations. [[Jegertroppen]] (Ranger Platoon) \u2013 a unit consisting of female conscripts only, highly trained for urban ISTAR operations.\n\nThe conventional units include:\n* [[Kystjegerkommandoen]] (Coastal Ranger Command) \u2013 operators are referred to as ''Kystjeger'' (Coastal Ranger) and are highly trained in conducting raids, ship-boarding and naval ISTAR operations along the Norwegian shore lines.\n* Fjernoppklaring ([[Long-range reconnaissance patrol|Long-Range Recon]]) \u2013 the operators are referred to as ''Feltoperat\u00f8r'' (Field Operator) and bears exactly the same status as a ''jeger''. This unit is highly trained in conducting ISTAR operations far behind enemy lines.\n* Artillerijeger (Artillery Ranger) \u2013 the soldiers are highly trained to conduct ISTAR missions mainly to support an [[Artillery Battalion (Norway)|artillery battalion]] with information, locations and fire missions regarding high valued artillery targets. The unit also consists of a large amount of J-TAC operators.\n* [[Garrison of S\u00f8r-Varanger|Grensejeger]] (Border Ranger) \u2013 a conscript unit consisting of infantry soldiers trained as ''jegers'' in order to maintain surveillance along the Norwegian/Russian border.\n\n''Jegers'' can also be seen within [[Heimevernet]] (Home Guard) as part of:\n* Jegerlag (Ranger Teams) \u2013 a Home Guard formation where former soldiers are attached to temporary units in order to conduct local ISTAR operations.\n\n===Sweden===\nSwedish ''\"j\u00e4gare\"'' are troops such as commandos or [[light infantry]]. The former now consist of:\n\n* Parachute Airborne Rangers \u2013 [[Fallsk\u00e4rmsj\u00e4garna|''fallsk\u00e4rmsj\u00e4gare'']] (lit. \"parachute rangers\")\n* Marine commandos of the [[Swedish Amphibious Corps]] \u2013 [[Kustj\u00e4garna|''kustj\u00e4gare'']] (lit. \"coastal rangers\")\n* Army Rangers of the [[Army Ranger Battalion (Sweden)|Army Ranger Battalion]]\n\nExamples of the latter include the airborne rangers of [[Life Regiment Hussars]] (same regiment as ''[[Fallsk\u00e4rmsj\u00e4garna]]''), the [[Swedish Air Force]]'s outer-perimeter patrols [[Swedish Air Force Rangers|''Flygbasj\u00e4garna'']] (lit. \"airbase rangers\") and the Military Police units for urban warfare from the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]].\n\nHistorically, the first units to be named \"j\u00e4gare\" were infantry and cavalry units stationed in the sparsely populated border province of [[J\u00e4mtland]]: [[Norrland Dragoon Regiment|J\u00e4mtlands h\u00e4stj\u00e4gark\u00e5r]] in 1834 and [[J\u00e4mtland Ranger Regiment|J\u00e4mtlands f\u00e4ltj\u00e4gark\u00e5r]] from 1853.\n\nAfter World War II, the [[Army Ranger School]], later [[Lapland Ranger Regiment|Lapplands j\u00e4garregemente]], was formed in [[Kiruna]]. In the following years, the then cavalry regiments mainly developed into either ranger regiments ([[Life Regiment Hussars|K 3]] and [[Norrland Dragoon Regiment|K 4]]) or into tank regiments.\n\n===Netherlands===\nAfter the Napoleonic period, the Jager Battalions were incorporated into the line infantry and disappeared as such (except for the Colonial Jager units destined for the West Indies). Their role was taken over by the [[flank companies]] of each battalion, one of every four battalions in an 'Afdeeling' or Regiment was designated a Flank Battalion (Light Infantry).\n\nIn 1829, a new Royal Guard was raised, which included a [[Grenadier]] Regiment and a Jager Battalion. These were immediately sent into action during the Belgian Secession (1830\u20131832). During that war, voluntary units like Van Dams' Jagers and several Voluntary Student Companies, were dressed and equipped as Jagers, including a mounted Jager detachment; after the war, these voluntary units were disbanded.\n\nIn 1995, after a long history as separate units, the Guard Grenadiers and Jagers were united into the [[Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment]].\n\nIn 1950, several Infantry Regiments were disbanded; their traditions were transferred to a new regiment, which was located and closely tied to [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] Province. Since it took over the traditions of the Jager Contingent of the [[German Confederation]], which was provided by Limburg Province, the Regiment was called the Limburgse Jagers and adopted the French horn in their emblem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.limburgsejagers.nl/content/regiment/geschiedenis |title=Oprichting, afstamming en geschiedenis Regiment Limburgse Jagers |first=J.A.M. |last=Komen |year=2014 |access-date=15 July 2018 |editor-first=Arie |editor-last=van Dijke |work=De Limburgse Jager}}</ref> Currently the active troops of this infantry regiment are located in Oirschot, just outside their home province in [[North Brabant]], but close ties to the province remain.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ca\u00e7adores]]\n* [[Chasseur]]\n* [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] with [[General der Gebirgstruppe]]\n* [[Imperial-Royal Mountain Troops]] (Austria-Hungary)\n* [[List of J\u00e4ger units#Germany (Imperial)|List of J\u00e4ger units]]\n* [[Rifleman]]\n* [[Sch\u00fctzen (military)|''Sch\u00fctzen'']]\n* [[V\u00e2n\u0103tori de munte]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |first=Hartwig |last=Busche |title=Formationsgeschichte der deutschen Infanterie im Ersten Weltkrieg 1914\u20131918 |year=1998 |location=Owschlag |publisher=Institut f\u00fcr Preussische Historiographie |language = German |isbn= }}\n*{{Cite book |first=H. |last=Kinna |first2=D.

During the 20th century, ''J\u00e4ger'' became the German word for [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] aircraft, while ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' was the name adopted for [[tank destroyer]]s. Conversely, in the modern ''[[Bundeswehr|German army]]'' (''Bundeswehr''), ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' is the name given to [[military police]].\n\n''J\u00e4ger'', in its original sense of light infantry, is usually translated into English as:\n\n* \"'''[[rifleman]]'''\" (in an infantry role) or \"'''Rifles'''\" (in regimental names) and; \n* \"'''[[United States Army Rangers#Colonial period|ranger]]'''\" (especially in [[North American English]]; see below).\n\nIn English ''J\u00e4ger'' is often written as ''jaeger'' (both pl. and sgl.) or anglicised as ''jager'' (pl. ''jagers'') to avoid the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]].\n\n== Age of Enlightenment (18th century) ==\n[[image:Franz Rudolf Frisching.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Rudolf Frisching]] in the uniform of an officer of the [[Bernese]] ''J\u00e4ger'' Corps with his [[Schweizerischer Niederlaufhund]], painted by [[Jean Preudhomme]] in 1785]]\n\nAccording to a popular theory, the earliest known ''J\u00e4ger'' unit was a company formed in about 1631 in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], under [[William V, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]].  Wilhelm supposedly formed an elite light infantry unit for the [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian Army]], around a core drawn from his personal staff of [[gamekeeper]]s (''Revierj\u00e4ger''; \"game preserve hunter\"), [[forest ranger]]s and/or professional hunters.\n\nHowever, it was not until the first half of the 18th century that the widespread recruitment began in various German states of gamekeepers, huntsmen and foresters employed on crown estates or those of noble landowners, for specialized units of riflemen and skirmishers.<ref>Christopher Duffy, ''The Military Experience in the Age of Reason'' ({{ISBN|1-85326-690-6}}), page 272</ref>\n\nBy the early 19th century, because of their civilian occupations, ''J\u00e4ger'' were usually familiar with the first true rifles, rather than the [[musket]]s used by regular infantry. While early [[long rifle]]s took longer to load than the [[smoothbore]] musket of the line infantry, they also had greater range and accuracy. The men were drawn from a \"well-esteemed class\".<ref>General [[Martin Ernst von Schlieffen]] quoted in R. Atwood's \"The Hessians\" Mercenaries from Hessen-Kassel in the American Revolution\", Cambridge 1980</ref> The ''J\u00e4ger'' became primarily used for [[reconnaissance]], [[skirmishers|skirmishing]] or screening bodies of heavier troops.\n\n[[Prussia]], Hesse, [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Russian Empire]] and many smaller states raised ''J\u00e4ger''-type small units during the [[Seven Years' War]] and thereafter. Initially these specialist units were formed for the duration of a particular campaign and thereafter disbanded. However, Russia maintained its ''J\u00e4ger'' companies on a permanent basis for frontier service against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Christopher Duffy, pages 272\u2013273 \"The Military Experience in the Age of Reason\", {{ISBN|1-85326-690-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Prussian ''J\u00e4ger'' corps of Frederick the Great dated back to a mounted detachment raised in November 1740 and quickly expanded to two squadrons. Employed in wartime as guides and scouts, they eventually proved a useful [[border guard|frontier guard]] tasked with catching deserters and seizing contraband. After 1744, they were joined by an infantry branch of foot ''J\u00e4gers'', initially divided into independent companies and then brought together as a full regiment by 1784.<ref>Philip Haythornthwaite, pages 13\u201314 \"Frederick the Great's Army \u2013 Specialist Troops\", {{ISBN|1-85532-225-0}}</ref> \nFor fighting at close quarters the ''J\u00e4ger'' carried a straight-bladed [[hunting dagger]] (''Hirschf\u00e4nger''), a short sabre or a [[falchion]].\n\nWhile the English term \"ranger\" is older, emerging during the 17th century to describe highly-mobile (\"ranging\") foot and [[mounted infantry]] units in [[British North America]], it became strongly associated with ''J\u00e4ger'' during the late 18th century, when German-speaking [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian regiments]] served as part of the [[British Army]] in North America.\n\n== Napoleonic era ==\nInterest in [[light infantry]] tactics increased across Europe after the [[Battle of Valmy]], where the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[line infantry]] proved unable to break through the [[Tirailleur|French sharpshooters]]. Initially soldiers were drawn directly from the line infantry to fight as skirmishers instead, but in time many [[German language|German-speaking]] states adopted ''J\u00e4ger'' to fulfill this role. In theory the ''J\u00e4ger'' operated in pairs to protect each other while reloading, and remained within 100\u2013200 yards of close-order infantry on which they could fall back if they were endangered by cavalry or driven off by infantry. However, it was admitted that, due to the difficulty of controlling troops spread out in open-order and in the thick of battle, these guidelines might not always be followed. ''J\u00e4ger'' were allowed to act with a certain amount of initiative on the battlefield, unlike [[line infantry]] who were rigidly drilled and kept under tight control by their officers. For this reason, it was the most energetic and daring soldiers who were selected to become a ''J\u00e4ger''.\n\nThe Prussians in particular developed their light infantry tactics both in theory and in practice during the early Napoleonic era. There was much disagreement over how much emphasis should be placed on ''J\u00e4gers'', though, and reform was for the most part at the regimental level by more energetic commanders such as [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]]. It was not until the reorganization of the army led by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] that the ''J\u00e4ger'' corps was strengthened on a national level. Having suffered crippling defeats at [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena]] and [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], the Prussian army undertook major reforms, in many ways following the example of the [[French Revolutionary Army]], becoming a nationalized force. Foreign mercenaries were removed, corporal punishment became rare (and was abolished for ''J\u00e4ger'' troops), and promotions were based on [[Meritocracy|merit]] rather than [[nobility]]. New volunteers from a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] background were organized to resist [[Napoleon]]'s invasion and occupation of Central Europe. Continuing the earlier traditions, in Prussia these ''J\u00e4ger'' were patriotic volunteers, bearing the cost of their weapons and uniforms at their own expense or with the help of contributions from friends and neighbours, and often organizing themselves into clubs and leagues. As one of the early adopters of skirmisher tactics, Yorck became inspector-general of the light infantry in Prussia and oversaw the increase and improvement of the new ''J\u00e4ger'' troops during the years of peace after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]]. The most famous of the Prussian ''J\u00e4ger'' were the volunteers of the [[L\u00fctzow Free Corps]].\n\nThe Prussian army gained experience as an auxiliary force in the [[French invasion of Russia]], where the ''J\u00e4ger'' were often used on the strategic level to provide support and cover for the rest of the army. They managed to escape the fate of Napoleon's French soldiers after Yorck negotiated a [[Convention of Tauroggen|battlefield truce]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] when, during a rear-guard action, the French withdrew and left Yorck's troops isolated. In the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] that immediately followed, the ''J\u00e4ger'' of the various armies performed well against Napoleon's forces, and Prussian ''J\u00e4ger'' played a significant role in the battles of the Waterloo campaign, holding off [[Emmanuel de Grouchy|Grouchy's]] corps at the [[Battle of Wavre]].\n\nThe resistance against Napoleon exacted a high toll of military casualties, officers in particular. This in combination with a shift towards a meritocratic officer corps led to many promotions within the ranks. By the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], many of the [[Military rank#Company grade or junior officers|junior officers]] in the Germanic states' armies were former ''J\u00e4ger'' soldiers who had been promoted through the ranks.\n\n== Prior to First World War==\nBy the early twentieth century, ''J\u00e4ger'' units were part of the Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian, Swedish, Dutch and Norwegian armies. They corresponded to the [[rifle]]s, [[light infantry]], ''[[chasseur]]s \u00e0 pied'' or ''[[bersaglieri]]'' units of the British, French, Italian and other armies. While such units still enjoyed considerable prestige and high ''esprit de corps'', their training, equipment and tactical roles had for the most part become aligned with those of the line infantry of their respective armies.\n\n===J\u00e4ger rank===\n''J\u00e4ger'' was in Austria and Germany until 1918 the lowest rank of the J\u00e4ger regiments, equivalent to private or soldier.\n\nOther follows private [[Gemeiner]] ranks - ''Musketier'' ([[musketeer]]), ''[[Grenadier]]'', ''F\u00fcsilier'' ([[fusilier]]), ''Infanterist'' ([[infantry]]man), ''Dragoner'' (en: [[dragoon#Dragoner rank|dragoon]]), ''Husar'' ([[hussar]]), ''Ulan'' ([[uhlan]]), ''Kanonier'', [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), ''Pionier'' ([[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]), ''Sanit\u00e4tssoldat'' ([[combat medic]]), ''Trainsoldat'' ([[Train (military)|trainman]])\n\n===Imperial Germany===\n[[File:J\u00e4gerpatrouille.

One ''J\u00e4ger'' battalion, the ''Gro\u00dfherzoglich Mecklenburgisches J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 14'', was from the [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Another, ''Westf\u00e4lisches J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 7'', known as the \"B\u00fcckeburg J\u00e4gers\", was raised in the [[Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe]], whose capital was [[B\u00fcckeburg]]. The other ten were from Prussian lands. In addition, another Prussian Guard unit, the [[Guards Rifles Battalion]], though not designated ''J\u00e4ger'', was a ''J\u00e4ger'' formation. Its origins were in a French ''chasseur'' battalion of the Napoleonic era, and its troops wore the shako and green tunic of the ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions.<ref>H. Kinna, page 1 ''J\u00e4ger & Sch\u00fctzen \u2013 Dress & Distinctions 1910\u201314'', {{ISBN|0-85242-497-3}}\"</ref>\n\nThe army of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] added two ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions, which were included in the Imperial German Army order of battle as ''Kgl. S\u00e4chsisches 1. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 12'' and ''Kgl. S\u00e4chsisches 2. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon Nr. 13''. The Saxon ''J\u00e4ger'' had a number of dress distinctions \u2013 notably tunics of a darker green than the Prussian colour, black facings instead of red and a black buffalo-hair plume buckled to the side of the shako. The autonomous Royal Bavarian Army provided a further two ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions, ''Kgl. Bayerisches 1. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon'' and ''Kgl. Bayerisches 2. J\u00e4ger-Bataillon'', who wore the light blue of Bavarian infantry with green facings.<ref>H.

In September 1914, an additional twelve reserve ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions were raised (ten Prussian and two Saxon). In May 1915, the German Army began joining the ''J\u00e4ger'' battalions to form ''J\u00e4ger'' regiments, and in late 1917, the ''Deutsche J\u00e4ger-Division'' was formed.\n\nDuring the early stages of [[World War I]], the German ''J\u00e4ger'' maintained their traditional role as skirmishers and scouts, often in conjunction with cavalry units. With the advent of trench warfare, they were committed to an ordinary infantry role, integrated into divisions and lost their status as independent units. Cyclist ''J\u00e4ger'' served in the Balkan and Russian theatres of war, while Wurttemberg and Bavaria raised Ski-''J\u00e4ger'' during the winter of 1914\u201315. Another specialist formation was the ''J\u00e4ger'' Storm Companies, serving as trench raiders during 1917\u20131918.\n\n====Mounted ''J\u00e4ger''====\nIn 1897, existing dispatch rider units within the Prussian Army were converted to ''Detachments J\u00e4ger' zu Pferde''. Further mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' squadrons were subsequently raised, including short-lived Bavarian and Saxon detachments. After 1901, the original dispatch carrying role of the mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' were discontinued. Five newly raised squadrons were brought together to form a combined Mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' Regiment the same year. The experiment proved a successful one and between 1905 and 1913 a further 13 mounted ''J\u00e4ger'' regiments were created.<ref>Dr Ernst Aichner, page 594 ''The German Cavalry from 1871 to 1914'', {{ISBN|3-902526-07-6}}</ref>\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n[[File:Franz Josef I in Kaiserj\u00e4geruniform.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] in the parade dress of the ''Kaiserj\u00e4ger'' 1879]]\nThe [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in 1914 included four regiments of ''Tiroler [[Kaiserj\u00e4ger]]'', descended from a unit first raised in 1801. There were also 29 battalions of ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' recruited from different regions across the Empire (including 7 Hungarian, 5 Bohemian and 4 Galician battalions) and one Bosnian-Herzegovinian ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' Battalion (''Bosnisch-hercegovinisches Feldj\u00e4gerbataillon''). All wore [[pike grey]] uniforms faced in green, with a form of [[bowler hat]] carrying a distinctive plume of dark green feathers. The exception was the [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry|Bosnian-Herzegovinian Feldj\u00e4ger Battalion]] which wore the [[Fez (clothing)|fez]]. Later, an additional three Feldj\u00e4ger battalions and seven Bosnian-Herzegovinian Feldj\u00e4ger Battalions were formed.\n\n==Second World War Germany ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-586-2221-14, Frankreich, Normandie, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger.jpg|thumb|right|German ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroopers) in Normandy June 1944, wearing camouflage smocks]]\nAfter the First World War, the ''J\u00e4ger'' units of the Imperial German Army were disbanded, but their traditions were carried by infantry regiments of the 100,000-man [[Reichswehr]] of the [[Weimar Republic]]. After the Nazis came to power in 1933 and the rearmament of Germany began, the new [[Wehrmacht]] revived the name ''J\u00e4ger'' for various types of units:\n\n* In 1935, the first specialized mountain infantry units were formed; their regiments and battalions were designated ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' (\"mountain infantry\" \u2013 ''Gebirge'' is German for \"mountain range\"). More specialized units, such as the ''Hochgebirgs-J\u00e4ger-Bataillone'', for use in high-Alpine conditions, were also developed. The Waffen SS raised a \"[[24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstj\u00e4ger|Karstj\u00e4ger]]\" Division.\n* When the [[Luftwaffe]] began forming parachute units in the late-1930s, the first parachute regiment was designated ''Fallschirm-J\u00e4ger-Regiment 1''. German paratroopers became known as ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (''Fallschirm'' is German for \"parachute\"). At first, ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' was applied only to genuine airborne-qualified troops, but the term was retained for ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' regiments and divisions even after they began operating as regular infantry. A number of ''[[Luftwaffe Field Division|Luftwaffe Feld-Divisionen]]'' (\"field divisions\"), regular ground combat units raised by the Luftwaffe, also used the term ''Luftwaffen-J\u00e4ger-Regiment'' for their infantry regiments. Many of these were later taken over by the army but retained the name ''J\u00e4ger-Regiment''.\n* Two ''Skij\u00e4ger'' regiments were formed in 1943 as part of ''Skij\u00e4ger-Brigade'' (later a ''Skij\u00e4ger-Division'').\n* Certain infantry divisions were raised as \"light infantry divisions\" (''leichte Infanterie-Divisionen'') in late 1940. They were raised to operate in rough terrain, especially in southeastern Europe. Their infantry regiments were called ''J\u00e4ger-Regimenter'', and in 1942 the light and light infantry divisions were renamed ''J\u00e4ger'' divisions.\n* The antitank units of German divisions, originally called ''Panzer-Abwehr-Abteilungen'' (\"anti-tank battalions\"), began in 1940 to be redesignated as ''Panzerj\u00e4ger-Abteilungen'', (literally \"tank hunter battalions\"). These were equipped with towed or self-propelled guns (often the ad hoc mounting of an antitank gun on a captured or obsolete tank chassis). As the war progressed, some ''Panzerj\u00e4ger-Abteilungen'' were fully equipped with specialized [[tank destroyers]], initially known as ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger]]'' (tank hunters), and later by 1943 as ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'' (\"hunting tank\") with enclosed, armored [[casemate]] superstructures.\n* The military police of the Wehrmacht was known as the ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]''. In December 1943, a new force of military police, directly subordinated to the Armed Forces High Command, was formed. Its units were designated ''Feldj\u00e4ger-Kommandos'' with subordinated ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' battalions and regiments. These were known collectively as the ''[[Feldj\u00e4gerkorps]]''. The name was taken from the ''Reitendes Feldj\u00e4gerkorps'', a Prussian Army [[military police]]-type unit directly under the General Staff.\n\n== After Second World War==\n\n===Germany===\n'''''J\u00e4ger''''' (short: '''''Jg'''''; English: hunter) is the lowest [[Soldat (rank)|soldier rank]] of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted men]] of the modern day's German [[Bundeswehr]] for soldiers light infantry, paratroopers and mountain troops.

These may vary according to the service branch (Heer, Luftwaffe, Bundeswehr, medical service etc.). Other examples are [[Grenadier]] for mechanized infantrymen and ''Kanonier'' for artillerymen.\n\nThe German ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' rejected the term ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'' and instead kept the term ''[[Feldj\u00e4ger]]'' for its military police units. To emphasize the traditional connection with the Prussian ''Reitendes Feldj\u00e4gerkorps'', rather than the ''Wehrmacht'' military police units, the ''Feldj\u00e4ger'' of the ''Bundeswehr'' wear a red beret with star badge (the ''[[Gardestern]]'') of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]], Prussia's highest chivalric order. The ''Reitendes Feldj\u00e4gerkorps'' had been granted the right to wear the ''Gardestern'' in 1847.\n\nIn addition, at certain periods, light infantry units of the ''Bundeswehr'' were designated as ''J\u00e4ger'', and wore a green beret with a beret badge patterned after the ''J\u00e4ger'' sleeve patch of the ''Wehrmacht'' ''J\u00e4ger'' units. Each battalion of ''J\u00e4ger'', ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' and ''Gebirgsj\u00e4ger'', has a \"heavy company\" of Wiesel weapon-carriers equipped with 20&nbsp;mm cannon, TOW launchers or 120&nbsp;mm mortars.\n\nThe modern ''J\u00e4ger''-type infantry units are distinguished as follows:\n* ''J\u00e4ger'' \u2013 light infantry specialized for assault and defense operations in urban and rugged terrain, in the context of mechanised combat troops. They can used for air-mobile/air-assault operations (heliborne). They wear a green beret with a golden badge displaying oak leaves surrounded by a braided chord.\n* ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' \u2013 \"Airborne Rangers\" \u2013 paratroopers, light airborne infantry units.  As above. They wear a Bordeaux beret with a badge displaying an attacking eagle.\n* ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' \u2013 \"Mountain Rangers\" \u2013 light infantry for mountain terran, rugged an urban terrain, with special equipment for winter warfare. Instead of a beret, they wear a grey ''Bergm\u00fctze'' mountain cap - a type of stiff forage cap \u2013 see {{illm|Bergm\u00fctze|de|Bergm%C3%BCtze}} (German)) with [[Leontopodium alpinum#Symbolic uses|Edelweiss insignia]].\n* in differnt The [[Wachbataillon]] (Guard battalion at the Ministry of Defence) is named for there soldiers ''Grenadier''.\nWith a former restructuring of the German Army, only one new air-mobile regiment, ''J\u00e4gerregiment'' 1 ([[Air Assault Infantry Regiment 1 (Bundeswehr)|JgRgt 1]]), two battalions, ''J\u00e4gerbataillon'' 291 (JgBtl 291) and ''J\u00e4gerbataillon'' 292 (JgBtl 292) (both battalions are part of the [[Franco-German Brigade]]) and two other new bataillons of the mechanised brigades are the only regular ''J\u00e4ger'' retained. On the other hand, ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' has become the most important infantry type, due to its versatility and the nature of modern-day peacekeeping missions abroad.\n\nWith the last restructuring of the German Army, J\u00e4gerregiment 1 was reduced to J\u00e4gerbataillon 1 (JgBtl 1), not air-mobile any longer.

Additionally, in all other Navy units except the Uusimaa Brigade, the private rank is ''matruusi'' (\"Sailor\"). \n\nThe old infantry rank of ''sotamies'' (\"private\", lit. \"soldier\") is no longer used in peacetime training units, but remains reserved for war-time infantry usage.\n\n'''J\u00e4ger as Troop Type indicator'''<br>\n\nThe word J\u00e4ger is also used to indicate a) in general the best trained & equipped combat arms troops of the Defence Forces and b) specifically for the following troops. \n\n''Finnish Army''\n* J\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rijoukot (\"J\u00e4ger Troops\") \u2013 refers to any 1st line infantry units with top-of-the-line equipment\n* Panssarij\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Armoured or Panzer J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 mechanized infantry of the Armoured Brigade\n* Kaartinj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Guards J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 infantry of the Guards J\u00e4ger Regt, specializing in MOUT\n* Laskuvarjoj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Parachute J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 rangers / paratroopers of the Utti J\u00e4ger Regt (conscripts)\n* Erikoisj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Special J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 the Army's Special Forces, part of the Utti J\u00e4ger Regt (career military)\n\n''Finnish Navy''\n* Rannikkoj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Coastal J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 Marines of the Uusimaa Brigade\n\n''Border Guards''\n* Rajaj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Border J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 rangers / light infantry of the Border Guard\n* Erikoisrajaj\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4rit (\"Special Border J\u00e4gers\") \u2014 Special Operations Capable forces within the Border Guard\n\nIn addition to the above, some non-infantry units use the word J\u00e4ger in their name to show direct lineage to the original J\u00e4ger Movement.\n\n===Norway===\n''Jeger'' is the general term indicating highly trained soldiers and operators capable of conducting military [[ISTAR]] (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance) operations independently behind enemy lines. There are several units using the ''jeger'' term, both conventional forces and special operation forces.\n\nThe SOF units include:\n* [[Marinejegerkommandoen]] (Navy Special Operation Command) \u2013 the SOF operators are referred to as ''Marinejeger'' (Navy Ranger) or ''Spesialb\u00e5toperat\u00f8r'' (Special Boat Operator) and is highly trained in naval SOF and ISTAR operations.\n* [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] (Armed Forces' Special Command) \u2013 this unit has several subcategories of ''jegers'': ''Spesialjeger'' (Special Ranger) \u2013 SOF operators trained highly for airborne SOF and ISTAR operations. ''Fallskjermjeger'' (Parachute Ranger) \u2013 conscript soldiers highly trained for raid and airborne ISTAR operations. [[Jegertroppen]] (Ranger Platoon) \u2013 a unit consisting of female conscripts only, highly trained for urban ISTAR operations.\n\nThe conventional units include:\n* [[Kystjegerkommandoen]] (Coastal Ranger Command) \u2013 operators are referred to as ''Kystjeger'' (Coastal Ranger) and are highly trained in conducting raids, ship-boarding and naval ISTAR operations along the Norwegian shore lines.\n* Fjernoppklaring ([[Long-range reconnaissance patrol|Long-Range Recon]]) \u2013 the operators are referred to as ''Feltoperat\u00f8r'' (Field Operator) and bears exactly the same status as a ''jeger''. This unit is highly trained in conducting ISTAR operations far behind enemy lines.\n* Artillerijeger (Artillery Ranger) \u2013 the soldiers are highly trained to conduct ISTAR missions mainly to support an [[Artillery Battalion (Norway)|artillery battalion]] with information, locations and fire missions regarding high valued artillery targets. The unit also consists of a large amount of J-TAC operators.\n* [[Garrison of S\u00f8r-Varanger|Grensejeger]] (Border Ranger) \u2013 a conscript unit consisting of infantry soldiers trained as ''jegers'' in order to maintain surveillance along the Norwegian/Russian border.\n\n''Jegers'' can also be seen within [[Heimevernet]] (Home Guard) as part of:\n* Jegerlag (Ranger Teams) \u2013 a Home Guard formation where former soldiers are attached to temporary units in order to conduct local ISTAR operations.\n\n===Sweden===\nSwedish ''\"j\u00e4gare\"'' are troops such as commandos or [[light infantry]]. The former now consist of:\n\n* Parachute Airborne Rangers \u2013 [[Fallsk\u00e4rmsj\u00e4garna|''fallsk\u00e4rmsj\u00e4gare'']] (lit. \"parachute rangers\")\n* Marine commandos of the [[Swedish Amphibious Corps]] \u2013 [[Kustj\u00e4garna|''kustj\u00e4gare'']] (lit. \"coastal rangers\")\n* Army Rangers of the [[Army Ranger Battalion (Sweden)|Army Ranger Battalion]]\n\nExamples of the latter include the airborne rangers of [[Life Regiment Hussars]] (same regiment as ''[[Fallsk\u00e4rmsj\u00e4garna]]''), the [[Swedish Air Force]]'s outer-perimeter patrols [[Swedish Air Force Rangers|''Flygbasj\u00e4garna'']] (lit. \"airbase rangers\") and the Military Police units for urban warfare from the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]].\n\nHistorically, the first units to be named \"j\u00e4gare\" were infantry and cavalry units stationed in the sparsely populated border province of [[J\u00e4mtland]]: [[Norrland Dragoon Regiment|J\u00e4mtlands h\u00e4stj\u00e4gark\u00e5r]] in 1834 and [[J\u00e4mtland Ranger Regiment|J\u00e4mtlands f\u00e4ltj\u00e4gark\u00e5r]] from 1853.\n\nAfter World War II, the [[Army Ranger School]], later [[Lapland Ranger Regiment|Lapplands j\u00e4garregemente]], was formed in [[Kiruna]]. In the following years, the then cavalry regiments mainly developed into either ranger regiments ([[Life Regiment Hussars|K 3]] and [[Norrland Dragoon Regiment|K 4]]) or into tank regiments.\n\n===Netherlands===\nAfter the Napoleonic period, the Jager Battalions were incorporated into the line infantry and disappeared as such (except for the Colonial Jager units destined for the West Indies). Their role was taken over by the [[flank companies]] of each battalion, one of every four battalions in an 'Afdeeling' or Regiment was designated a Flank Battalion (Light Infantry).\n\nIn 1829, a new Royal Guard was raised, which included a [[Grenadier]] Regiment and a Jager Battalion. These were immediately sent into action during the Belgian Secession (1830\u20131832). During that war, voluntary units like Van Dams' Jagers and several Voluntary Student Companies, were dressed and equipped as Jagers, including a mounted Jager detachment; after the war, these voluntary units were disbanded.\n\nIn 1995, after a long history as separate units, the Guard Grenadiers and Jagers were united into the [[Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment]].\n\nIn 1950, several Infantry Regiments were disbanded; their traditions were transferred to a new regiment, which was located and closely tied to [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] Province. Since it took over the traditions of the Jager Contingent of the [[German Confederation]], which was provided by Limburg Province, the Regiment was called the Limburgse Jagers and adopted the French horn in their emblem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.limburgsejagers.nl/content/regiment/geschiedenis |title=Oprichting, afstamming en geschiedenis Regiment Limburgse Jagers |first=J.A.M. |last=Komen |year=2014 |access-date=15 July 2018 |editor-first=Arie |editor-last=van Dijke |work=De Limburgse Jager}}</ref> Currently the active troops of this infantry regiment are located in Oirschot, just outside their home province in [[North Brabant]], but close ties to the province remain.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ca\u00e7adores]]\n* [[Chasseur]]\n* [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] with [[General der Gebirgstruppe]]\n* [[Imperial-Royal Mountain Troops]] (Austria-Hungary)\n* [[List of J\u00e4ger units#Germany (Imperial)|List of J\u00e4ger units]]\n* [[Rifleman]]\n* [[Sch\u00fctzen (military)|''Sch\u00fctzen'']]\n* [[V\u00e2n\u0103tori de munte]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |first=Hartwig |last=Busche |title=Formationsgeschichte der deutschen Infanterie im Ersten Weltkrieg 1914\u20131918 |year=1998 |location=Owschlag |publisher=Institut f\u00fcr Preussische Historiographie |language = German |isbn= }}\n*{{Cite book |first=H. |last=Kinna |first2=D.
