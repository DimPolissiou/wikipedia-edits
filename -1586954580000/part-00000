They will then swim until they find some sort of substrate on which to attach themselves. Typically that substrate would be something hard and rough with plenty of shade, but mostly they will attach to the shells of oysters.<ref name=\":0\" /> In either case, they begin to develop into polyps. From this point, if conditions are favorable, they will undergo a process known as strobilation occurs.

Compared to ''[[Chrysaora quinquecirrha|C. quinquecirrha]]'', ''C. chesapeakei'' has a bell size that is on average half as small, usually around 10 cm. It also has fewer tentacles and longer oral arms. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://st/feature-news/jellyfish-species-discovered|title=Jellyfish Species Discovered|website=feature-news|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\n== Lifecycle ==\nWhen the eggs of ''C. chesapeakei'' are developed, the mother jellyfish will carry them on her oral arms until the ciliated planulae develop. They will then swim until they find some sort of substrate on which to attach themselves. Typically that substrate would be something hard and rough with plenty of shade, but mostly they will attach to the shells of oysters.<ref name=\":0\" /> In either case, they begin to develop into polyps. From this point, if conditions are favorable, they will undergo a process known as strobilation occurs. This is when the polyp asexually produces the ephyrae into the water which then develop into the medusae.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url=https://login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12237-018-0459-7.pdf|title=Proxy Login - University Libraries - USC|website=login.pallas2.tcl.sc.edu|doi=10.1007/s12237-018-0459-7|access-date=2019-04-19|volume=42|year=2019|pages=513\u2013527 | last1 = Stone | first1 = Joshua P. | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = Deborah K. | last3 = Fabrizio | first3 = Mary C.}}</ref> If conditions are not favorable, the polyps will continue in their benthic stage where they will wait for the return of favorable conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.3389/fmars.2018.00257|title=Boom and Bust: Life History, Environmental Noise, and the (un)Predictability of Jellyfish Blooms|journal=Frontiers in Marine Science|volume=5|year=2018|last1=Schnedler-Meyer|first1=Nicolas A.|last2=Ki\u00f8rboe|first2=Thomas|last3=Mariani|first3=Patrizio|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Feeding ==\nIndividuals of the ''C. chesapeakei'' species are typically carnivorous.
