It was originally serialized in ''[[Comic Beam]]'' from the December 2002 to August 2013 issue, and published in 15 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Enterbrain]] from July 2003 to August 2013. The series is licensed in English by [[Fantagraphics Books]], which released the first volume in North America in July 2011. A 12-episode [[anime]] adaptation produced by [[Anime International Company|AIC Classic]] and directed by [[Ei Aoki]] aired in Japan between January and March 2011. Eleven episodes aired on television, with episodes 10 and 11 edited into a single episode, and were released individually on their respective BD/DVD volumes.\n\nThe story depicts a young student named Shuichi Nitori, described by the author as a [[transgender|trans]] girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a trans boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, [[gender identity]], and the beginning of [[puberty]]. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school who wants to be a boy, but she realized that a boy who wants to be a girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. ''Wandering Son'' was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the start of ''Wandering Son'', Shuichi Nitori is a student in the [[fifth grade]] who transfers into a new school. Shuichi quickly becomes friends with another student: the tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, Yoshino confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages Shuichi to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another student their age from another class who also secretly wants to be a girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult [[trans woman]] named Yuki who is living with a man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Sat\u014d and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school.\n\nIn junior high school, they meet a tall, eccentric girl who befriends everyone, Chizuru Sarashina, and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, who does not get along well with the others\u2014especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much to the surprise of their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's [[Puberty#Voice change|voice is changing]]. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.\n\nShuichi begins attending the same all-boy high school as Makoto and Doi, while Yoshino and Saori begin attending a high school where uniforms are not required. Saori starts dating Fumiya Ninomiya. Yoshino starts working at Anna's modeling agency and Shuichi begins working at a cafe, but later quits. Shuichi starts writing a semi-autobiographical novel. Yoshino later tells Shuichi that the former does not think about wanting to be a boy anymore, and also confesses a romantic attraction to Shuichi. Shuichi still identifies as a girl, and even after informing Anna of this, she stays with Shuichi. After graduating from high school, Shuichi moves out and goes to the same college as Doi. Shuichi continues to write the novel, which is given the title {{Nihongo|''The Boy Who's a Girl''|\u307c\u304f\u306f\u3001\u304a\u3093\u306a\u306e\u3053|Boku wa, Onna no Ko}}.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Protagonists===\n[[File:H\u014dr\u014d Musuko characters.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A group of six junior high school students standing side by side in school uniforms.

It was originally serialized in ''[[Comic Beam]]'' from the December 2002 to August 2013 issue, and published in 15 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Enterbrain]] from July 2003 to August 2013. The series is licensed in English by [[Fantagraphics Books]], which released the first volume in North America in July 2011. A 12-episode [[anime]] adaptation produced by [[Anime International Company|AIC Classic]] and directed by [[Ei Aoki]] aired in Japan between January and March 2011. Eleven episodes aired on television, with episodes 10 and 11 edited into a single episode, and were released individually on their respective BD/DVD volumes.\n\nThe story depicts a young student named Shuichi Nitori, described by the author as a [[transgender|trans]] girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a trans boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, [[gender identity]], and the beginning of [[puberty]]. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school who wants to be a boy, but she realized that a boy who wants to be a girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. ''Wandering Son'' was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the start of ''Wandering Son'', Shuichi Nitori is a student in the [[fifth grade]] who transfers into a new school. Shuichi quickly becomes friends with another student: the tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, Yoshino confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages Shuichi to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another student their age from another class who also secretly wants to be a girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult [[trans woman]] named Yuki who is living with a man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Sat\u014d and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school.\n\nIn junior high school, they meet a tall, eccentric girl who befriends everyone, Chizuru Sarashina, and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, who does not get along well with the others\u2014especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much to the surprise of their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's [[Puberty#Voice change|voice is changing]]. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.\n\nShuichi begins attending the same all-boy high school as Makoto and Doi, while Yoshino and Saori begin attending a high school where uniforms are not required. Saori starts dating Fumiya Ninomiya. Yoshino starts working at Anna's modeling agency and Shuichi begins working at a cafe, but later quits. Shuichi starts writing a semi-autobiographical novel. Yoshino later tells Shuichi that the former does not think about wanting to be a boy anymore, and also confesses a romantic attraction to Shuichi. Shuichi still identifies as a girl, and even after informing Anna of this, she stays with Shuichi. After graduating from high school, Shuichi moves out and goes to the same college as Doi. Shuichi continues to write the novel, which is given the title {{Nihongo|''The Boy Who's a Girl''|\u307c\u304f\u306f\u3001\u304a\u3093\u306a\u306e\u3053|Boku wa, Onna no Ko}}.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Protagonists===\n[[File:H\u014dr\u014d Musuko characters.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A group of six junior high school students standing side-by-side in school uniforms.

{"title_page": "Alternatives to general relativity", "text_new": "{{Short description|Proposed theories of gravity}}\n\n{{disputed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Alternatives to general relativity''' are [[Physical theory|physical theories]] that attempt to describe the phenomenon of [[gravitation]] in competition to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]]. He assumed, like [[Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6llner]], that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them.

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

The action is split into: <math> S=S_G+S_K+S_S+S_M</math> with terms for gravity, vector field <math>K_\\mu,</math> scalar fields <math>G, \\omega, \\mu</math> and mass. <math>S_G</math> is the standard gravity term with the exception that <math>G</math> is moved inside the integral.\n\n: <math>S_K=-\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\omega \\left( \\frac14 B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} + V(K) \\right), \\qquad \\text{where } \\quad B_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_\\mu K_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu K_\\mu.</math>\n\n: <math>S_S = -\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{G^3} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu G\\,\\nabla_\\nu G -V(G) \\right) + \\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\omega\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\omega -V(\\omega) \\right) +{1\\over\\mu^2G} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\mu\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\mu - V(\\mu) \\right).</math>\n\nThe potential function for the vector field is chosen to be:\n\n: <math>V(K) = -\\frac12\\mu^2\\varphi^\\mu\\varphi_\\mu - \\frac14g \\left (\\varphi^\\mu \\varphi_\\mu \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is a coupling constant.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G.

In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them.

See [[relativity priority dispute]].

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3.

[[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]].

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more. In the first, a pre-existing special relativity space-time and universal time coordinate acts with matter and non-gravitational fields to generate a scalar field.  This scalar field acts together with all the rest to generate the metric.\n\nThe action is:\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-g}L_\\varphi+S_m</math>\n\n: <math>L_\\varphi=\\varphi R-2g^{\\mu\\nu} \\, \\partial_\\mu\\varphi \\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi</math>\n\nMisner et al.<ref name=Misner1973>Misner, C.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

It is set primarily at the beginning of the [[Edo period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] and features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals replacing humans. The main character is a [[rabbit]] ''[[r\u014dnin]]'', [[Miyamoto Usagi]], whom Sakai based partially on the famous [[swordsman]] [[Miyamoto Musashi]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Don't get between the rabbit and his sword|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=2005-11-25|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/18/books/bk-solomon18|accessdate=2010-11-28 | first=Charles | last=Solomon}}</ref> Usagi wanders the land on a ''[[musha shugy\u014d]]'' (warrior's [[pilgrimage]]), occasionally selling his services as a [[bodyguard]].\n\n''Usagi Yojimbo'' is heavily influenced by Japanese cinema and has included references to the work of [[Akira Kurosawa]] (the title of the series is derived from Kurosawa's 1960 film ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'') and to icons of popular Japanese cinema such as [[Lone Wolf and Cub]], [[Zatoichi]], and [[Godzilla]]. The series is also influenced somewhat by ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]'' by [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]] (Sakai is the letterer for that series), but the overall tone of ''Usagi Yojimbo'' is more serious and reflective. The series follows the standard traditional Japanese naming-convention for all featured characters: their [[family name]]s followed by their [[given name]]s.\n\nThe books are primarily [[Episodic writing|episodic]], with underlying larger plots which create long extended storylines\u2014though there are some novel-length narratives.

The first publisher was Fantagraphics (volume one; 38 regular issues, plus one ''Summer Special'' and three ''Color Specials''). The second was [[Mirage Comics]] (volume two; 16 issues). The third is [[Dark Horse Comics]], by which ''Usagi Yojimbo'' is still being published (as volume three, over 160 issues), and who also released a fourth ''Color Special''. A fourth publisher, [[Radio Comix]], published two issues of ''The Art of Usagi Yojimbo'' which contained a selection of unpublished drawings, convention sketches, and other miscellaneous ''Usagi Yojimbo'' artwork. The first issue also included an original ''Usagi Yojimbo'' short story. In 2004, Dark Horse Comics published a Twentieth Anniversary hardcover volume also entitled ''The Art of Usagi Yojimbo''.\n\nBecause ''Usagi Yojimbo'' is a [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] comic and Sakai has complete and sole ownership of the character, Miyamoto Usagi has been able to appear in occasional short stories published by companies other than the one currently publishing his series. Usagi has appeared in stories published by [[Cartoon Books]], [[Oni Press]], [[Sky Dog Press]], [[Wizard Press]], and most recently in the benefit book ''Drawing the Line'', the proceeds of which went to [[Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto)|Princess Margaret Hospital]] and the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], both in Toronto, for cancer research.\n\nSakai has experimented with formats for ''Usagi Yojimbo'', such as when he published the color story \"Green Persimmon\" first as twelve separate 2-page chapters serialized in Diamond Comic Distributor's monthly catalog \"Previews.\" He has also serialized two short stories in a comic strip format in the tabloid size promotional publication ''Dark Horse Extra''. ''Usagi Yojimbo'' stories have also been created as both single page \"gag\" stories and as multi-issue epic adventures.\n\nUsagi has also [[Fictional crossovers|appeared]] several times in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (the comic, all three of the [[animated series]], and their respective [[toy|toy lines]]), and the Turtles have appeared in ''Usagi Yojimbo'' as well. In the 1987 series, \"Usagi Yojimbo\" is incorrectly used as his actual name, but in the 2003 series, where he appeared far more frequently, he was referred to correctly as Miyamoto Usagi. He was even joined by Gen and other characters from his stories in his guest appearances in the 2003 series. Usagi's first appearance in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 series]] was the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) (season 5)|Season Five]] episode \"Yojimbo\", which was written by Sakai. In his guest appearances, he is closest to [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], both sharing the same ideals and code of ethics.<ref>{{cite news|title= 25 years of \"usagi yojimbo\" |publisher= Comic Book Resources |date=|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23585|accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref> The comics version also makes several pun references to [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]]' ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]'', in whose publication Sakai was also involved.\n\nIn addition, Sakai created a limited [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] series called ''Space Usagi'' featuring characters similar to those in the original series, including a descendant of Miyamoto Usagi, but set in a futuristic setting that also emulated [[History of Japan#Medieval Japan|feudal Japan]] in political and stylistic ways. Three mini-series of three issues each and two short stories featuring the characters were produced. Sakai has tentative plans to produce a fourth ''Space Usagi'' miniseries, but nothing has been announced yet.<ref>[http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/comingup.html#future Coming Up in Usagi Yojimbo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020040511/http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/comingup.html#future |date=2007-10-20 }}.

''Senso'', Japanese for \"war\", refers to ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' novel about Martians invading Earth. 'Senso' tells the story of Martians invading Japan roughly 20 years after the events of the main-series of 'Usagi Yojimbo', and also forms a plot bridge to the previously published ''Space Usagi''.\n\nIn May 2015, Sakai returned to Usagi Yojimbo with the release of the 145th issue.\n\nOn February 22 2019, [[The New York Times]] reported that IDW Publishing will present a new monthly ''Usagi Yojimbo'' series, in color (provided by [[Tom Luth]] for the first time.) The new series will open with a short story arc about the Japanese puppetry art of [[bunraku]]. Additionally, new full-color collections of earlier issues are planned.<ref>{{cite news|title= A Samurai Rabbit Comic Book Adventure Finds a New Home |publisher=The New York Times |date=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/design/usagi-yojimbo-new-publisher.html}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Awards===\nThe series has been awarded 5 [[Eisner awards]] and over{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} 20 nominations.\n\n* 1996 Eisner Award for \"Best Letterer\" (Groo and Usagi Yojimbo)\n* 1996 Eisner Award for \"Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition\" (Usagi Yojimbo)\n* 1999 Eisner Award for \"Best Serialized Story\" (Usagi Yojimbo \"Grasscutter\")\n* 2012 Eisner Award for \"Best Lettering\" (Usagi Yojimbo)\n* 2015 Eisner Award for \"Best Lettering\" (Usagi Yojimbo)\n* 2018 Eisner Award for \"Best Lettering\" (Usagi Yojimbo and Groo: Slay of the Gods)\n\nThe [[Japanese American National Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]]'s [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]] presented an exhibit entitled \"Year of the Rabbit: Stan Sakai's ''Usagi Yojimbo'' from July 9 through October 30, 2011.\n\nUsagi was rated No.&nbsp;92 on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/92|title=Usagi Yojimbo - #92 Top Comic Book Heroes - IGN|website=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===Film references===\nSeveral of the characters in Usagi's world are inspired by or make reference to samurai movies. Usagi's former lord is named Mifune, which is a nod to [[Toshiro Mifune]], an actor who starred in countless classic Samurai films. [[Murakami Gennosuke|Gen]], the rhino bounty hunter, was inspired by the characters made famous by [[Toshiro Mifune]] in the [[chambara|samurai films]] ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Sanjuro]]''. [[Zato-Ino]], the Blind Swordspig, is a reference and tribute to the film character of [[Zatoichi]]. The story arc \"Lone Goat and Kid\" features an assassin who wanders with his son in a babycart, referring to the [[film]]/[[manga]] series, ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]''. Most significantly, the main character's name, [[Miyamoto Usagi]], is a play on \"[[Miyamoto Musashi]]\", Japan's most famous historical samurai and the author of ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', and ''Usagi'' the [[Japanese language]] word for \"[[rabbit]]\" (The story notes for one volume also cite as an influence [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s [[Samurai Trilogy]], which features Miyamoto Musashi as a protagonist.) His friend Tomoe Ame, a feline samurai, is inspired by the female samurai [[Tomoe Gozen]]. The storyline \"The Dragon Bellow Conspiracy\" includes elements reminiscent of the classic Akira Kurosawa films ''The Seven Samurai'' and ''The Hidden Fortress'', particularly the way that Usagi collects various allies to raid an evil lord's fortress.\n\nWhile ''Usagi Yojimbo'' draws most heavily upon samurai and [[chanbara]] films, it has also been influenced by Japanese films from other genres. For example, the three-part story \"Sumi-E\" (included in Vol. 18. ''Travels with Jotaro'') features monsters resembling [[Godzilla]] (identified as \"Zylla\", who was first introduced in Vol. 2. ''Samurai''), [[Gamera]], [[Ghidorah]], [[Mothra]], and [[Daimajin]].\n\n==Appearances on television==\nUsagi first appeared in Episodes 32 and 34 in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) (season 3)|third season]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]]. He next appeared in episodes 23\u201326 in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) (season 2)|second season]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]] for an interdimensional tournament against the Turtles (along with Gen). He and Gen showed up again in episodes 1 and 22-23 of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) (season 3)|season 3]] for a [[Christmas]] party and a continuation of the season 2 storyline (which prominently featured his world and characters), respectively. Usagi again appeared in episode 13 of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) (season 4)|season 4]] for a confrontation with Leonardo, although the focus was mainly on Gen. Usagi and Gen also attended the wedding of April O'Neil and Casey Jones in episode 13 of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) (season 7)|season 7]] (''Back to the Sewer'') titled \"Wedding Bells and Bytes\". He becomes one of their greatest inter-dimensional allies and especially closest to Leonardo.\n\nIn September 2016, an appearance of Usagi was also announced for the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 CGI series]] of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''.<ref>[http://www.teenagemutantninjaturtles.com/2016/09/14/sakai-confirms-usagi-yojimbo-nick-tmnt/ Justin W.: ''Stan Sakai Confirms Usagi Yojimbo Will Be In Nickelodeon\u2019s TMNT''].

It is set primarily at the beginning of the [[Edo period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]] and features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals replacing humans. The main character is a [[rabbit]] ''[[r\u014dnin]]'', [[Miyamoto Usagi]], whom Sakai based partially on the famous [[swordsman]] [[Miyamoto Musashi]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Don't get between the rabbit and his sword|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=2005-11-25|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/18/books/bk-solomon18|accessdate=2010-11-28 | first=Charles | last=Solomon}}</ref> Usagi wanders the land on a ''[[musha shugy\u014d]]'' (warrior's [[pilgrimage]]), occasionally selling his services as a [[bodyguard]].\n\n''Usagi Yojimbo'' is heavily influenced by Japanese cinema and has included references to the work of [[Akira Kurosawa]] (the title of the series is derived from Kurosawa's 1960 film ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'') and to icons of popular Japanese cinema such as [[Lone Wolf and Cub]], [[Zatoichi]], and [[Godzilla]]. The series is also influenced somewhat by ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]'' by [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]] (Sakai is the letterer for that series), but the overall tone of ''Usagi Yojimbo'' is more serious and reflective. The series follows the standard traditional Japanese naming-convention for all featured characters: their [[family name]]s followed by their [[given name]]s.\n\nThe books are primarily [[Episodic writing|episodic]], with underlying larger plots which create long extended storylines\u2014though there are some novel-length narratives.

The first publisher was Fantagraphics (volume one; 38 regular issues, plus one ''Summer Special'' and three ''Color Specials''). The second was [[Mirage Comics]] (volume two; 16 issues). The third is [[Dark Horse Comics]], by which ''Usagi Yojimbo'' is still being published (as volume three, over 160 issues), and who also released a fourth ''Color Special''. A fourth publisher, [[Radio Comix]], published two issues of ''The Art of Usagi Yojimbo'' which contained a selection of unpublished drawings, convention sketches, and other miscellaneous ''Usagi Yojimbo'' artwork. The first issue also included an original ''Usagi Yojimbo'' short story. In 2004, Dark Horse Comics published a Twentieth Anniversary hardcover volume also entitled ''The Art of Usagi Yojimbo''.\n\nBecause ''Usagi Yojimbo'' is a [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] comic and Sakai has complete and sole ownership of the character, Miyamoto Usagi has been able to appear in occasional short stories published by companies other than the one currently publishing his series. Usagi has appeared in stories published by [[Cartoon Books]], [[Oni Press]], [[Sky Dog Press]], [[Wizard Press]], and most recently in the benefit book ''Drawing the Line'', the proceeds of which went to [[Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto)|Princess Margaret Hospital]] and the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], both in Toronto, for cancer research.\n\nSakai has experimented with formats for ''Usagi Yojimbo'', such as when he published the color story \"Green Persimmon\" first as twelve separate 2-page chapters serialized in Diamond Comic Distributor's monthly catalog \"Previews.\" He has also serialized two short stories in a comic strip format in the tabloid size promotional publication ''Dark Horse Extra''. ''Usagi Yojimbo'' stories have also been created as both single page \"gag\" stories and as multi-issue epic adventures.\n\nUsagi has also [[Fictional crossovers|appeared]] several times in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (the comic, all three of the [[animated series]], and their respective [[toy|toy lines]]), and the Turtles have appeared in ''Usagi Yojimbo'' as well. In the 1987 series, \"Usagi Yojimbo\" is incorrectly used as his actual name, but in the 2003 series, where he appeared far more frequently, he was referred to correctly as Miyamoto Usagi. He was even joined by Gen and other characters from his stories in his guest appearances in the 2003 series. Usagi's first appearance in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 series]] was the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series) (season 5)|Season Five]] episode \"Yojimbo\", which was written by Sakai. In his guest appearances, he is closest to [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], both sharing the same ideals and code of ethics.<ref>{{cite news|title= 25 years of \"usagi yojimbo\" |publisher= Comic Book Resources |date=|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23585|accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref> The comics version also makes several pun references to [[Sergio Aragon\u00e9s]]' ''[[Groo the Wanderer]]'', in whose publication Sakai was also involved.\n\nIn addition, Sakai created a limited [[Spin-off (media)|spin off]] series called ''Space Usagi'' featuring characters similar to those in the original series, including a descendant of Miyamoto Usagi, but set in a futuristic setting that also emulated [[History of Japan#Medieval Japan|feudal Japan]] in political and stylistic ways. Three mini-series of three issues each and two short stories featuring the characters were produced. Sakai has tentative plans to produce a fourth ''Space Usagi'' miniseries, but nothing has been announced yet.<ref>[http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/comingup.html#future Coming Up in Usagi Yojimbo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020040511/http://www.usagiyojimbo.com/comingup.html#future |date=2007-10-20 }}.

''Senso'', Japanese for \"war\", refers to ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', [[H. G. Wells]]' novel about Martians invading Earth. 'Senso' tells the story of Martians invading Japan roughly 20 years after the events of the main-series of 'Usagi Yojimbo', and also forms a plot bridge to the previously published ''Space Usagi''.\n\nIn May 2015, Sakai returned to Usagi Yojimbo with the release of the 145th issue.\n\nOn February 22 2019, [[The New York Times]] reported that IDW Publishing will present a new monthly ''Usagi Yojimbo'' series, in color (provided by [[Tom Luth]] for the first time.)

Usagi's former lord is named Mifune, which is a nod to [[Toshiro Mifune]], an actor who starred in countless classic Samurai films. [[Murakami Gennosuke|Gen]], the rhino bounty hunter, was inspired by the characters made famous by [[Toshiro Mifune]] in the [[chambara|samurai films]] ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Sanjuro]]''. [[Zato-Ino]], the Blind Swordspig, is a reference and tribute to the film character of [[Zatoichi]]. The story arc \"Lone Goat and Kid\" features an assassin who wanders with his son in a babycart, referring to the [[film]]/[[manga]] series, ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]''. Most significantly, the main character's name, [[Miyamoto Usagi]], is a play on \"[[Miyamoto Musashi]]\", Japan's most famous historical samurai and the author of ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', and ''Usagi'' the [[Japanese language]] word for \"[[rabbit]]\" (The story notes for one volume also cite as an influence [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s [[Samurai Trilogy]], which features Miyamoto Musashi as a protagonist.) His friend Tomoe Ame, a feline samurai, is inspired by the female samurai [[Tomoe Gozen]]. The storyline \"The Dragon Bellow Conspiracy\" includes elements reminiscent of the classic Akira Kurosawa films ''The Seven Samurai'' and ''The Hidden Fortress'', particularly the way that Usagi collects various allies to raid an evil lord's fortress.\n\nWhile ''Usagi Yojimbo'' draws most heavily upon samurai and [[chanbara]] films, it has also been influenced by Japanese films from other genres. For example, the three-part story \"Sumi-E\" (included in Vol. 18. ''Travels with Jotaro'') features monsters resembling [[Godzilla]] (identified as \"Zylla\", who was first introduced in Vol. 2. ''Samurai''), [[Gamera]], [[Ghidorah]], [[Mothra]], and [[Daimajin]].\n\n==Appearances on television==\nUsagi first appeared in Episodes 32 and 34 in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) (season 3)|third season]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]]. He next appeared in episodes 23-26 in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) (season 2)|second season]] of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]] for an interdimensional tournament against the Turtles (along with Gen). He and Gen showed up again in episodes 1 and 22-23 of [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) (season 3)|season 3]] for a [[Christmas]] party and a continuation of the season 2 storyline (which prominently featured his world and characters), respectively.

In 1996, Fantagraphics had released a two-part collection of the series \u2014 ''Palestine, a Nation Occupied'' (collecting ''Palestine'' #1-5) and ''Palestine: In the Gaza Strip'' (collecting issues #6-9).<ref>Sult, Evan. \"Palestine,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #200 (Dec. 1997), p. 61.</ref> An expanded edition was released in 2007.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe book takes place over a two-month period in late 1991 / early 1992, with occasional flashbacks to the expulsion of the Arabs, the beginning of the [[First Intifada|Intifada]], the [[Gulf War]] and other events in the more immediate past. Sacco spent this time meeting with Palestinians in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] and the narrative focuses on the minute details of everyday life in these area.\n\nIn ''Palestine'' Sacco positions himself knowingly as the westerner going to the [[Middle East]] to confront a reality unfamiliar to his American audience. Sacco does not delude himself that as a \"neutral\" observer he can remain invisible and have no effect on the events around him, instead accepting his role and concentrating on his personal experience of the situation. Though his goal is to document events and interview Palestinians he is affected by the reality of the occupied territories and cannot help but participate in, and comment on, demonstrations, funerals, roadblocks and encounters with soldiers. Towards the end he becomes even more active as he shares food and lodgings with the Palestinians he interviews and even breaks curfew with them while in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the book Sacco references [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Under Western Eyes (novel)|Under Western Eyes]]'', ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', and [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' to draw links between the situation he is witnessing and [[colonialism]]. Towards the end of the book, when challenged by an Israeli that he hasn't experienced their point of view, he responds that the Israeli point of view is what he has internalized his whole life, and although another trip would be necessary to fully experience Israel, that was not why he was there.<ref>Sacco, Joe.

His first published work appeared in the form of two short stories in the Italian magazine ''[[Intrepido]]''.  He was first published in America in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Marvel Shadows and Light'', with one of his pinups appearing in the comic book.  Di Vito was asked to join the [[CrossGen]] staff as an associate [[penciller]] and became a fill-in artist for the comic books ''[[The First (comics)|The First]]'' and ''[[Scion (comics)|Scion]]'', becoming the official penciller of the former six months later.\n\nAfter nine issues on ''The First'', Di Vito worked with [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[Rob Schwager]] on a new project, ''[[Brath]]''.  After over a year of work on this title, Di Vito decided to expand his horizons, lending his talents to other companies.

His first published work appeared in the form of two short stories in the Italian magazine ''[[Intrepido]]''.  He was first published in America in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Marvel Shadows and Light'', with one of his pinups appearing in the comic book.  Di Vito was asked to join the [[CrossGen]] staff as an associate [[penciller]] and became a fill-in artist for the comic books ''[[The First (comics)|The First]]'' and ''[[Scion (comics)|Scion]]'', becoming the official penciller of the former six months later.\n\nAfter nine issues on ''The First'', Di Vito worked with [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[Rob Schwager]] on a new project, ''[[Brath]]''.  After over a year of work on this title, Di Vito decided to expand his horizons, lending his talents to other companies.

It first appeared in the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Evening Journal]]'', whose owner, [[William Randolph Hearst]], was a major booster for the strip throughout its run. The characters had been introduced previously in a side strip with Herriman's earlier creation, ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''.<ref>Blackbeard, Bill and Martin Williams, \"The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics\". pp. 59\u201360.</ref> The phrase \"Krazy Kat\" originated there, said by the mouse by way of describing the cat. Set in a dreamlike portrayal of Herriman's vacation home of [[Coconino County, Arizona]], ''Krazy'' {{nowrap|''Kat''{{'s}}}} mixture of offbeat [[surrealism]], innocent playfulness and poetic, idiosyncratic language has made it a favorite of comics aficionados and art critics for more than 80 years.<ref name = \"Kramer\"/><ref name=\"Shannon\">Shannon.</ref><ref name=\"MOD 26\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 26.</ref>\n\nThe strip focuses on the curious relationship between a guileless, carefree, simple-minded cat named Krazy and a short-tempered mouse named Ignatz. Krazy nurses an unrequited love for the mouse. However, Ignatz despises Krazy and constantly schemes to throw bricks at Krazy's head, which Krazy interprets as a sign of affection, uttering grateful replies such as \"Li'l dollink, allus f'etful\", or \"Li'l ainjil\". A third principal character, Officer Bull Pupp, often appears and tries to \"protect\" Krazy by thwarting Ignatz' attempts and imprisoning him. Later on, Officer Pupp falls in love with Krazy.\n\nDespite the slapstick simplicity of the general premise, the detailed characterization, combined with Herriman's visual and verbal creativity,  made ''Krazy Kat'' one of the first comics to be widely praised by intellectuals and treated as \"serious\" art.<ref name=\"Kramer\">Kramer.</ref> Art critic [[Gilbert Seldes]] wrote a lengthy [[panegyric]] to the strip in 1924, calling it \"the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SELDES/ch15.html The Krazy Kat That Walks By Himself] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108185720/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SELDES/ch15.html |date=2010-01-08 }}\".

While the local geography is fluid, certain sites were stable\u2014and featured so often in the strip as to become iconic. These latter included Officer Pupp's jailhouse and Kolin Kelly's brickyard. A Southwestern visual style is evident throughout, with clay-shingled rooftops, trees planted in pots with designs imitating [[Navajo people|Navajo]] art, along with references to Mexican-American culture. The strip also occasionally features incongruous trappings borrowed from the stage, with curtains, backdrops, theatrical placards, and sometimes even floor lights framing the panel borders.\n\nThe descriptive passages mix whimsical, often [[alliteration|alliterative]] language with [[eye spelling|phonetically-spelled dialogue]] and a strong poetic sensibility (\"[[Agathla Peak|Agathla]], centuries aslumber, shivers in its sleep with splenetic splendor, and spreads abroad a seismic spasm with the supreme suavity of a vagabond volcano.\").<ref>''A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night'' 71.</ref> Herriman was also fond of experimenting with unconventional page layouts in his Sunday strips, including panels of various shapes and sizes, arranged in whatever fashion he thought would best tell the story.\n\nThough the basic concept of the strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head sometimes succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or [[Gnome (rhetoric)|gnomic]] pronouncements irritating the mouse so much that he goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even [[self-referential humor]] is evident\u2014in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.<ref>''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'' 97.</ref>\n\nPublic reaction at the time was mixed; many were puzzled by its iconoclastic refusal to conform to linear comic strip conventions and straightforward gags. But publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] loved ''Krazy Kat'', and it continued to appear in his papers throughout its run, sometimes only by his direct order.<ref>Schwartz 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n== Cast of characters ==\n\n=== Krazy Kat ===\nSimple-minded, curious, mindlessly happy and perpetually innocent, the strip's title character drifts through life in Coconino County without a care. Krazy's dialogue is a highly stylized [[argot]] (\"A fowl konspirissy \u2013 is it pussible?\")<ref>''Pilgrims on the Road to Nowhere'', 47.</ref> phonetically evoking a mixture of English, French, Spanish, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and other dialects, often identified as George Herriman's own native [[New Orleans]] dialect, [[Yat dialect|Yat]].<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> Often singing and dancing to express the Kat's eternal joy, Krazy is hopelessly in love with Ignatz and thinks that the mouse's brick-tossing is his way of returning that love. Krazy is also completely unaware of the bitter rivalry between Ignatz and \"Offissa\" Pupp and mistakes the dog's frequent imprisonment of the mouse for an innocent game of [[tag (game)|tag]] (\"Ever times I see them two playing games togedda, Ignatz seems to be It\").<ref>''There is a Heppy Lend, Fur, Fur Awa-a-ay-'', 62.</ref> On those occasions when Ignatz is caught before he can launch his brick, Krazy is left pining for the \"l'il ainjil\" and wonders where the beloved mouse has gone.\n\nKrazy's own gender is never made clear and appears to be fluid, varying from strip to strip. Most authors post-Herriman (beginning with Cummings) have mistakenly referred to Krazy only as female,<ref>Crocker.</ref> but Krazy's creator was more ambiguous and even published several strips poking fun at this uncertainty.<ref>''Necromancy By the Blue Bean Bush'', 16\u201317.</ref><ref>''A Katnip Kantata in the Key of K'', 71.</ref> When filmmaker [[Frank Capra]], a fan of the strip, asked Herriman to straightforwardly define the character's sex, the cartoonist admitted that Krazy was \"something like a sprite, an elf. They have no sex. So that Kat can't be a he or a she. The Kat's a spirit\u2014a pixie\u2014free to butt into anything.\"<ref>Schwartz 9.</ref>  Most characters inside the strip use \"he\" and \"him\" to refer to Krazy, likely as a gender-neutral \"he\".\n\n=== Ignatz Mouse ===\n[[File:Krazypanel-4-16-1922.jpg|thumb|right|266px|alt=cartoon Ignatz being marched off by Officer Pupp for trying to throw a brick at Krazy Kat.|Ignatz being marched off by Officer Pupp for trying to throw a brick at Krazy Kat. Behind the newspaper, Krazy is reading and describing aloud the very same cartoon in which they are all appearing.]]\nIgnatz is driven to distraction by Krazy's na\u00efvet\u00e9, and he throws bricks at Krazy Kat's head.  To shield his plans from Officer Pupp, Ignatz hides his bricks, disguises himself, or enlists the aid of willing Coconino County denizens (without making his intentions clear). Easing Ignatz's task is Krazy Kat's willingness to meet him anywhere at any appointed time, eager to receive a token of affection in the form of a brick to the head.  Ignatz is married with three children, though they are rarely seen.\n\nIronically, although Ignatz seems to generally dislike Krazy, one strip shows his ancestor, [[Mark Antony]] Mouse, fall in love with Krazy's ancestor, an Egyptian cat princess (calling her his \"Star of the Nile\"), and pay a sculptor to carve a brick with a love message. When he throws it at her, he is arrested, but she announces her love for him, and from that day on, he throws bricks at her to show his love for her (which would explain why Krazy believes that Ignatz throwing bricks is a sign of love). In another strip, Krazy kisses a sleeping Ignatz, and hearts appear above the mouse's head.\n\nIn the last five (or so) years of the strip, Ignatz's dislike for Krazy was noticeably downplayed. While earlier, one got the sense of his taking advantage of Krazy's willingness to be \"bricked\", now one gets the sense of Ignatz and Krazy as chummy co-conspirators against Pupp, with Ignatz at times quite aware of the positive way Krazy interprets his missiles.\n\n=== Officer Bull Pupp ===\nA police dog who loves Krazy, and always tries (sometimes successfully) to thwart Ignatz's desires to pelt Krazy Kat with bricks. Officer Pupp and Ignatz often try to get the better of each other even when Krazy is not directly involved, as they both enjoy seeing the other played for a fool. He appears slightly less frequently than Krazy and Ignatz. He is also the main character of his own short film series.\n\n=== Secondary characters ===\nBeyond these three, Coconino County is populated with an assortment of incidental, recurring characters.\n*'''Joe [[Stork]]:''' the \"purveyor of progeny to prince & [[proletariat|proletarian]]\",<ref>''A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night'' 67, et al.</ref> often makes baby deliveries to various characters. (In one strip, Ignatz tries to trick him into dropping a brick onto Krazy's head from above.) The character debuted in ''Gooseberry Sprig'' as the titular character's \"Prime Minister.\" \n*'''Kolin Kelly:''' a dog; a brickmaker by trade who bakes his wares in a kiln.  Often Ignatz's source for projectiles, although he distrusts the mouse.\n*'''Mrs. Kwakk Wakk:''' a duck in a [[pillbox hat]], a [[scold]] and busybody who frequently notices Ignatz in the course of his plotting and informs Officer Pupp. She is a social climber, attempting in one strip continuity to replace Pupp as police chief.\n\nOther characters who make semi-frequent appearances are: \n*'''Walter Cephus Austridge:''' a nondescript [[ostrich]]\n*'''Bum Bil Bee:''' a transient, bearded insect\n*'''Don Kiyote:''' an inconsequential heterodox Mexican [[coyote]]\n*'''Mock Duck:''' a clairvoyant fowl of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent who operates a [[Chinese laundry|cleaning establishment]].\n*'''Gooseberry Sprig:''' the Duck Duke, who briefly starred in his own strip before ''Krazy Kat'' was created.\n*Also: Krazy's '''Aunt Tabby''' and '''Uncle Tom'''; and his aerial and aquatic cousins, respectively: '''Krazy Katbird''' and '''Krazy Katfish'''. \n*Ignatz also has relations; his family of look-alike mice includes his wife, '''Magnolia''' and a trio of equally unruly sons named '''Milton, Marshall''' and '''Irving'''.\n\n== History ==\n''Krazy Kat'' evolved from an earlier comic strip of Herriman's, ''[[The Dingbat Family]]'', which started in June 1910 and was later renamed ''The Family Upstairs''. This comic chronicled the Dingbats' attempts to avoid the mischief of the mysterious unseen family living in the apartment above theirs and to unmask that family. Herriman would complete the cartoons about the Dingbats, and finding himself with time left over in his [[Eight-hour day|8-hour work day]], filled the bottom of the strip with slapstick drawings of the upstairs family's mouse preying upon the Dingbats' cat.<ref>McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 52.</ref>\n\n[[File:Krazykat.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=cartoon page of Ignatz Mouse resolves not to throw any more bricks at Krazy. |Ignatz Mouse resolves not to throw any more bricks at Krazy. Temptation follows him at every turn, and ultimately he finds a loophole to indulge his passion. (January 6, 1918)]]\n\nThis \"basement strip\" grew into something much larger than the original cartoon. It became a daily comic strip with a title (running vertically down the side of the page) on October 28, 1913 and a black and white full-page Sunday cartoon on April 23, 1916. Due to the objections of editors, who did not think it was suitable for the comics sections, ''Krazy Kat'' originally appeared in the Hearst papers' art and drama sections.<ref>McDonnell, O'Connell and De Havenon 58.</ref> Hearst himself, however, enjoyed the strip so much that he gave Herriman a lifetime contract and guaranteed the cartoonist complete creative freedom.\n\nDespite its low popularity among the general public, ''Krazy Kat'' gained a wide following among intellectuals. In 1922, a [[jazz]] [[ballet]] based on the comic was produced and scored by [[John Alden Carpenter]]; though the performance played to sold-out crowds on two nights<ref>Blackbeard 1\u20133.</ref> and was given positive reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'',<ref name = \"McDonnell 66-7\">McDonnell, O'Connell and De Havenon 66\u201367.</ref> it failed to boost the strip's popularity as Hearst had hoped. In addition to Seldes and Cummings, contemporary admirers of ''Krazy Kat'' included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[H. L. Mencken]], and [[Jack Kerouac]].<ref name=\"MOD 26\"/> More recent scholars and authors have seen the strip as reflecting the [[Dada]] movement<ref>Inge.</ref> and prefiguring [[postmodernism]].<ref name=\"Shannon\"/><ref name=\"Bloom\">Bloom.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1935, ''Krazy Kat''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Sunday edition was published in full color. Though the number of newspapers carrying it dwindled in its last decade, Herriman continued to draw ''Krazy Kat''\u2014creating roughly 3,000 cartoons\u2014until his death in April 1944 (the final page was published exactly two months later, on June 25). Hearst promptly canceled the strip after the artist died, because, contrary to the common practice of the time, he did not want to see a new cartoonist take over.<ref>Schwartz 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n=== Animated adaptations ===\n[[File:Krazy Kat Bugologist 1916 silent.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=4|The title card of this 1916 silent short read ''Krazy Kat \u2013 Bugologist''. A Cartoon By George Herriman. Animated by [[Frank Moser (artist)|Frank Moser]].\" Length 3m24s, 416kbit/s]]\nThe comic strip was animated several times (see filmography below).  The earliest ''Krazy Kat'' shorts were produced by Hearst in 1916. They were produced under [[Hearst-Vitagraph News Pictorial]] and later the [[International Film Service]] (IFS), though Herriman was not involved. In 1920, after a two-year hiatus, the [[Bray Productions|John R. Bray studio]] began producing a second series of ''Krazy Kat'' shorts.<ref name=\"Crafton\">Crafton.</ref> These cartoons hewed close to the comic strips, including Ignatz, Pupp and other standard supporting characters. Krazy's ambiguous gender and feelings for Ignatz were usually preserved; bricks were occasionally thrown.  With added sound effects and music, these cartoons were in periodic reissue during the 1930s and 1940s, and ended up being syndicated to television in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1925, animation pioneer [[Bill Nolan (animator)|Bill Nolan]] decided to bring Krazy to the screen again.  Nolan intended to produce the series under Associated Animators, but when it dissolved, he sought distribution from [[Margaret J. Winkler]]. Unlike earlier adaptations, Nolan did not base his shorts on the characters and setting of the Herriman comic strip. Instead, the feline in Nolan's cartoons was a male cat whose design and personality both reflected [[Felix the Cat]].  This is probably due to the fact that Nolan himself was a former employee of the [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]] studio.<ref>Maltin 205\u201306.</ref> Other Herriman characters appeared in the Nolan cartoons at first, though similarly altered: Kwakk Wakk was at times Krazy's paramour,<ref>Winkler Productions: copyright synopsis for ''Web Feet'' (1927).</ref> with Ignatz often the bully trying to break up the romance.<ref>''Rail Rode''.</ref> Over time, Nolan's influence waned and new directors, Ben Harrison and Manny Gould, took over the series. By late 1927, they were solely in charge.\n\nWinkler's husband, [[Charles B. Mintz]], slowly began assuming control of the operation. Mintz and his studio began producing the cartoons in sound beginning with 1929's ''[[Ratskin]]''. In 1930, he moved the staff to [[California]] and ultimately changed the design of Krazy Kat. The new character bore even less resemblance to the one in the newspapers. Mintz's Krazy Kat was, like many other early 1930s cartoon characters, imitative of [[Mickey Mouse]], and usually engaged in slapstick comic adventures with his look-alike girlfriend and loyal pet dog.<ref>Maltin 207.</ref> In 1936, animator [[Isadore Klein]], with the blessing of Mintz, set to work creating the short, ''[[Lil' Ainjil]]'', the only Mintz work that was intended to reflect Herriman's comic strip. However, Klein was \"terribly disappointed\" with the resulting cartoon, and the Mickey-derivative Krazy returned.<ref>Maltin 210\u201311.</ref>  In 1939, Mintz became indebted to his distributor, [[Columbia Pictures]], and subsequently sold his studio to them.<ref>Maltin 213.</ref>  The studio produced only one more Krazy Kat cartoon, ''[[The Mouse Exterminator]]'' in 1940 as part of their [[Phantasies]] series. In the 1960s, some of the shorts were Colorized by [[Fred Ladd]] and released on Super 8mm.<ref name=\"Columbia\">[http://columbia.goldenagecartoons.com/history/screen/  Screen Gems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807202522/http://columbia.goldenagecartoons.com/history/screen/ |date=August 7, 2009 }}, The Columbia Crow's Nest \u2014 Columbia Cartoon History.</ref>\n\nKing Features produced 50 ''Krazy Kat'' cartoons from 1962\u20131964, most of which were created at [[Gene Deitch]]'s [[Rembrandt Films]] in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the Czech Republic), whilst the rest were produced by Artransa Film Studios in Sydney, Australia.  The cartoons were initially televised interspersed with ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' (some of which were also produced by Artransa) and ''[[Snuffy Smith]]'' cartoons to form a half-hour TV show.  These cartoons helped to introduce Herriman's cat to the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom generation]]. The King Features shorts were made for television and have a closer connection to the comic strip; the backgrounds are drawn in a similar style, Ignatz was present and once again the reluctant object of Krazy's affection.

All five issues were drawn by cartoonist [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]], best known for his ''[[Little Lulu]]'' comic books.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://stanleystories.blogspot.com/2008/08/from-krazy-kat-4-1952-soups-on.html |title=from 'Krazy Kat' #4, 1952: soup's on! |first= Frank M.|last=Young |work=Stanley Stories|date=August 9, 2008|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> While the general plot premise is reminiscent of Herriman's strip, the look and feel are entirely different: firmly in the visual and written style of 1950s \"funny animal\" strips for children. Krazy is male in this version of the strip while Ignatz is female. This \"Krazy Kat\" also made several one-shot appearances in Dell's ''[[Four Color Comics]]'' series, from 1953 through 1956 (#454, 504, 548, 619, 696,)<ref>{{cite web|title=Dell Four Color Comics |url=http://www.dellfourcolorcomics.com/Comics/DellFourColor/DellFour-ColorSeries2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721005015/http://www.dellfourcolorcomics.com/Comics/DellFourColor/DellFour-ColorSeries2/ |archivedate=July 21, 2009 }}</ref> and was reprinted in some [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]] and Page Comics over the next decade.\n\n== Chronology of formats ==\nThe strip went through several format changes during its run, each of which impacted the artwork and the narratives that the form of the strip could accommodate.  What follows are the landmarks, which can also help to date the era of a given strip.\n\n* '''July 26, 1910:''' First \"beaning\" of Kat by Mouse at bottom of ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''. Strip is not sectioned off, but a detail at the bottom of the panels. Strip as a whole tended to run 4&nbsp;inches \u00d7 13&nbsp;inches.  Soon the Kat and Mouse were a five-panel 1\u00bd inch strip at the bottom of the cartoon.<ref name=\"MOD 55\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 55.</ref>\n* '''1911:'''  First brief run of ''Krazy and I. Mouse'' standalone strips (probably as a replacement to ''The Family Upstairs'').  Also, the characters briefly take over the strip for a couple of periods in '''1912''' (at least once, while the Dingbats are \"on holiday\" in '''July 1912'''.)\n* '''October 28, 1913.'''  ''Krazy Kat'' debuts as a five-panel daily vertical strip which runs down the side of a full comics page. This remains its daily format until sometime in 1920.<ref name=\"MOD 57\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 57.</ref>\n* '''April 23, 1916:'''  First black and white full page Sunday strip.\n* '''March 4&nbsp;\u2013 October 30, 1920:'''  The \"Panoramic Dailies\" period, where Herriman is allowed to experiment wildly in an unbroken daily horizontal 3 \u00d7 13&nbsp;inch space.\n* '''November 1920 on:'''  Herriman is constrained to a more conventional daily horizontal format containing three equal split sections, with the center section further split in two.  This allows the strip to be run full page, half page or a third of a page, according to editorial whim.  From September 13 to October 15, 1921, Herriman regains some control (no split center section) and resumes the previous years' format experiments.\n* '''January 7&nbsp;\u2013 March 11, 1922:''' In the ''New York Journal'', 10 weeks of Saturday full-page color strips, in addition to the ongoing Sunday full page black-and-white strips. (In other words, two original full-page strips every week).  This is then canceled due to its lack of noticeable commercial success, compared to the new Saturday color sections in out-of-town Hearst papers which contained no ''Krazy Kat.''<ref>''A Katnip Kantata in the Key of K'', 1\u20133</ref>\n* '''August 1925 to September 1929:''' Sundays are confined to 3-row, split-middle-line format allowing some papers to reduce cartoon's size and reformat into two daily-sized rows.<ref name=\"MOD 77\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 77.</ref>\n* '''Summer 1934:''' Full page Sunday strips cease entirely, for roughly a year.\n* '''June 1, 1935:'''  Full page Sunday strips resume, now in color, until Herriman's death.\n* '''December 11, 1938:''' \"Optional\" horizontal panel begins running on bottom of Sunday strips, as placeholder for potential advertising.\n* '''June 25, 1944:''' Final Sunday strip published.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1934, the live action film ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]] the cat playing the fiddle ([[Peter Gordon (actor)|Peter Gordon]]) is repeatedly hit in the head with a brick by a mouse (a capuchin monkey) costumed to look similar to Disney's [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>McDonnell, Patrick, ''Krazy Kat. The Comic Art of George Herrian'', Harry N.

Jackson]] Krazy Kat, Ignatz Mouse and Officer Pup make an appearance printed on a pale blue T-shirt worn by Jackson's character Jules who had to hastily change his clothes after an accidental in car shooting. \n\nIn 1999, ''Krazy Kat'' was rated #1 in a ''[[The Comics Journal|Comics Journal]]'' list of the best American comics of the 20th century; the list included both [[comic book]]s and comic strips.<ref>[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2302 \"Kreem of the Komics!\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908064542/http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2302 |date=2012-09-08 }}, ''Detroit Metrotimes''.

The Netherlands' Real Free Press published five issues of ''Krazy Kat Komix'' in 1974\u20131976, containing a few hundred strips apiece; each of the issues' covers was designed by [[Joost Swarte]].  However, owing to the difficulty of tracking down high-quality copies of the original newspapers, no plans for a comprehensive collection of ''Krazy Kat'' strips surfaced until the 1980s.\n\nAll of the [[Sunday strip]]s from 1916 to 1924 were reprinted by [[Eclipse Comics]] in cooperation with Turtle Island Press. The intent was to eventually reprint every Sunday ''Krazy Kat'', but this planned series was aborted when Eclipse ceased business in 1992. Beginning in 2002, [[Fantagraphics]] resumed reprinting Sunday ''Krazy Kat''s where Eclipse left off; in 2008, their tenth release completed the run with 1944.

The 1922 and 1923 books skipped a small number of strips, which have now been reprinted by ''[[Comics Revue]]''. ''Comics Revue'' also published all of the daily strips from September 8, 1930 through December 31, 1934. In 2007, Fantagraphics offered a one-shot reprint of daily strips from 1910s and 1920s, and plans a more complete reprinting of the daily strip in the future.\n\nScattered Sundays and dailies have appeared in several collections, including the [[Grosset & Dunlap]] book reprinted by [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]], but the most readily available sampling of Sundays and dailies from throughout the strip's run is ''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'', published by [[Harry N.

It first appeared in the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Evening Journal]]'', whose owner, [[William Randolph Hearst]], was a major booster for the strip throughout its run. The characters had been introduced previously in a side strip with Herriman's earlier creation, ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''.<ref>Blackbeard, Bill and Martin Williams, \"The Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics\". pp. 59\u201360.</ref> The phrase \"Krazy Kat\" originated there, said by the mouse by way of describing the cat. Set in a dreamlike portrayal of Herriman's vacation home of [[Coconino County, Arizona]], ''Krazy'' {{nowrap|''Kat''{{'s}}}} mixture of offbeat [[surrealism]], innocent playfulness and poetic, idiosyncratic language has made it a favorite of comics aficionados and art critics for more than 80 years.<ref name = \"Kramer\"/><ref name=\"Shannon\">Shannon.</ref><ref name=\"MOD 26\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 26.</ref>\n\nThe strip focuses on the curious relationship between a guileless, carefree, simple-minded cat named Krazy and a short-tempered mouse named Ignatz. Krazy nurses an unrequited love for the mouse. However, Ignatz despises Krazy and constantly schemes to throw bricks at Krazy's head, which Krazy interprets as a sign of affection, uttering grateful replies such as \"Li'l dollink, allus f'etful\", or \"Li'l ainjil\". A third principal character, Officer Bull Pupp, often appears and tries to \"protect\" Krazy by thwarting Ignatz' attempts and imprisoning him. Later on, Officer Pupp falls in love with Krazy.\n\nDespite the slapstick simplicity of the general premise, the detailed characterization, combined with Herriman's visual and verbal creativity,  made ''Krazy Kat'' one of the first comics to be widely praised by intellectuals and treated as \"serious\" art.<ref name=\"Kramer\">Kramer.</ref> Art critic [[Gilbert Seldes]] wrote a lengthy [[panegyric]] to the strip in 1924, calling it \"the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SELDES/ch15.html The Krazy Kat That Walks By Himself] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108185720/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/SELDES/ch15.html |date=2010-01-08 }}\".

While the local geography is fluid, certain sites were stable\u2014and featured so often in the strip as to become iconic. These latter included Officer Pupp's jailhouse and Kolin Kelly's brickyard. A Southwestern visual style is evident throughout, with clay-shingled rooftops, trees planted in pots with designs imitating [[Navajo people|Navajo]] art, along with references to Mexican-American culture. The strip also occasionally features incongruous trappings borrowed from the stage, with curtains, backdrops, theatrical placards, and sometimes even floor lights framing the panel borders.\n\nThe descriptive passages mix whimsical, often [[alliteration|alliterative]] language with [[eye spelling|phonetically-spelled dialogue]] and a strong poetic sensibility (\"[[Agathla Peak|Agathla]], centuries aslumber, shivers in its sleep with splenetic splendor, and spreads abroad a seismic spasm with the supreme suavity of a vagabond volcano.\").<ref>''A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night'' 71.</ref> Herriman was also fond of experimenting with unconventional page layouts in his Sunday strips, including panels of various shapes and sizes, arranged in whatever fashion he thought would best tell the story.\n\nThough the basic concept of the strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to tweak the formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head sometimes succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or [[Gnome (rhetoric)|gnomic]] pronouncements irritating the mouse so much that he goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even [[self-referential humor]] is evident\u2014in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.<ref>''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'' 97.</ref>\n\nPublic reaction at the time was mixed; many were puzzled by its iconoclastic refusal to conform to linear comic strip conventions and straightforward gags. But publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] loved ''Krazy Kat'', and it continued to appear in his papers throughout its run, sometimes only by his direct order.<ref>Schwartz 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n== Cast of characters ==\n\n=== Krazy Kat ===\nSimple-minded, curious, mindlessly happy and perpetually innocent, the strip's title character drifts through life in Coconino County without a care. Krazy's dialogue is a highly stylized [[argot]] (\"A fowl konspirissy \u2013 is it pussible?\")<ref>''Pilgrims on the Road to Nowhere'', 47.</ref> phonetically evoking a mixture of English, French, Spanish, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and other dialects, often identified as George Herriman's own native [[New Orleans]] dialect, [[Yat dialect|Yat]].<ref name=\"Shannon\"/> Often singing and dancing to express the Kat's eternal joy, Krazy is hopelessly in love with Ignatz and thinks that the mouse's brick-tossing is his way of returning that love. Krazy is also completely unaware of the bitter rivalry between Ignatz and \"Offissa\" Pupp and mistakes the dog's frequent imprisonment of the mouse for an innocent game of [[tag (game)|tag]] (\"Ever times I see them two playing games togedda, Ignatz seems to be It\").<ref>''There is a Heppy Lend, Fur, Fur Awa-a-ay-'', 62.</ref> On those occasions when Ignatz is caught before he can launch his brick, Krazy is left pining for the \"l'il ainjil\" and wonders where the beloved mouse has gone.\n\nKrazy's own gender is never made clear and appears to be fluid, varying from strip to strip. Most authors post-Herriman (beginning with Cummings) have mistakenly referred to Krazy only as female,<ref>Crocker.</ref> but Krazy's creator was more ambiguous and even published several strips poking fun at this uncertainty.<ref>''Necromancy By the Blue Bean Bush'', 16\u201317.</ref><ref>''A Katnip Kantata in the Key of K'', 71.</ref> When filmmaker [[Frank Capra]], a fan of the strip, asked Herriman to straightforwardly define the character's sex, the cartoonist admitted that Krazy was \"something like a sprite, an elf. They have no sex. So that Kat can't be a he or a she. The Kat's a spirit\u2014a pixie\u2014free to butt into anything.\"<ref>Schwartz 9.</ref>  Most characters inside the strip use \"he\" and \"him\" to refer to Krazy, likely as a gender-neutral \"he\".\n\n=== Ignatz Mouse ===\n[[File:Krazypanel-4-16-1922.jpg|thumb|right|266px|alt=cartoon Ignatz being marched off by Officer Pupp for trying to throw a brick at Krazy Kat.|Ignatz being marched off by Officer Pupp for trying to throw a brick at Krazy Kat. Behind the newspaper, Krazy is reading and describing aloud the very same cartoon in which they are all appearing.]]\nIgnatz is driven to distraction by Krazy's na\u00efvet\u00e9, and he throws bricks at Krazy Kat's head.  To shield his plans from Officer Pupp, Ignatz hides his bricks, disguises himself, or enlists the aid of willing Coconino County denizens (without making his intentions clear). Easing Ignatz's task is Krazy Kat's willingness to meet him anywhere at any appointed time, eager to receive a token of affection in the form of a brick to the head.  Ignatz is married with three children, though they are rarely seen.\n\nIronically, although Ignatz seems to generally dislike Krazy, one strip shows his ancestor, [[Mark Antony]] Mouse, fall in love with Krazy's ancestor, an Egyptian cat princess (calling her his \"Star of the Nile\"), and pay a sculptor to carve a brick with a love message. When he throws it at her, he is arrested, but she announces her love for him, and from that day on, he throws bricks at her to show his love for her (which would explain why Krazy believes that Ignatz throwing bricks is a sign of love). In another strip, Krazy kisses a sleeping Ignatz, and hearts appear above the mouse's head.\n\nIn the last five (or so) years of the strip, Ignatz's dislike for Krazy was noticeably downplayed. While earlier, one got the sense of his taking advantage of Krazy's willingness to be \"bricked\", now one gets the sense of Ignatz and Krazy as chummy co-conspirators against Pupp, with Ignatz at times quite aware of the positive way Krazy interprets his missiles.\n\n=== Officer Bull Pupp ===\nA police dog who loves Krazy, and always tries (sometimes successfully) to thwart Ignatz's desires to pelt Krazy Kat with bricks. Officer Pupp and Ignatz often try to get the better of each other even when Krazy is not directly involved, as they both enjoy seeing the other played for a fool. He appears slightly less frequently than Krazy and Ignatz. He is also the main character of his own short film series.\n\n=== Secondary characters ===\nBeyond these three, Coconino County is populated with an assortment of incidental, recurring characters.\n*'''Joe [[Stork]]:''' the \"purveyor of progeny to prince & [[proletariat|proletarian]]\",<ref>''A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night'' 67, et al.</ref> often makes baby deliveries to various characters. (In one strip, Ignatz tries to trick him into dropping a brick onto Krazy's head from above.) The character debuted in ''Gooseberry Sprig'' as the titular character's \"Prime Minister.\" \n*'''Kolin Kelly:''' a dog; a brickmaker by trade who bakes his wares in a kiln.  Often Ignatz's source for projectiles, although he distrusts the mouse.\n*'''Mrs. Kwakk Wakk:''' a duck in a [[pillbox hat]], a [[scold]] and busybody who frequently notices Ignatz in the course of his plotting and informs Officer Pupp. She is a social climber, attempting in one strip continuity to replace Pupp as police chief.\n\nOther characters who make semi-frequent appearances are: \n*'''Walter Cephus Austridge:''' a nondescript [[ostrich]]\n*'''Bum Bil Bee:''' a transient, bearded insect\n*'''Don Kiyote:''' an inconsequential heterodox Mexican [[coyote]]\n*'''Mock Duck:''' a clairvoyant fowl of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent who operates a [[Chinese laundry|cleaning establishment]].\n*'''Gooseberry Sprig:''' the Duck Duke, who briefly starred in his own strip before ''Krazy Kat'' was created.\n*Also: Krazy's '''Aunt Tabby''' and '''Uncle Tom'''; and his aerial and aquatic cousins, respectively: '''Krazy Katbird''' and '''Krazy Katfish'''. \n*Ignatz also has relations; his family of look-alike mice includes his wife, '''Magnolia''' and a trio of equally unruly sons named '''Milton, Marshall''' and '''Irving'''.\n\n== History ==\n''Krazy Kat'' evolved from an earlier comic strip of Herriman's, ''[[The Dingbat Family]]'', which started in June 1910 and was later renamed ''The Family Upstairs''. This comic chronicled the Dingbats' attempts to avoid the mischief of the mysterious unseen family living in the apartment above theirs and to unmask that family. Herriman would complete the cartoons about the Dingbats, and finding himself with time left over in his [[Eight-hour day|8-hour work day]], filled the bottom of the strip with slapstick drawings of the upstairs family's mouse preying upon the Dingbats' cat.<ref>McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 52.</ref>\n\n[[File:Krazykat.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=cartoon page of Ignatz Mouse resolves not to throw any more bricks at Krazy. |Ignatz Mouse resolves not to throw any more bricks at Krazy. Temptation follows him at every turn, and ultimately he finds a loophole to indulge his passion. (January 6, 1918)]]\n\nThis \"basement strip\" grew into something much larger than the original cartoon. It became a daily comic strip with a title (running vertically down the side of the page) on October 28, 1913 and a black and white full-page Sunday cartoon on April 23, 1916. Due to the objections of editors, who did not think it was suitable for the comics sections, ''Krazy Kat'' originally appeared in the Hearst papers' art and drama sections.<ref>McDonnell, O'Connell and De Havenon 58.</ref> Hearst himself, however, enjoyed the strip so much that he gave Herriman a lifetime contract and guaranteed the cartoonist complete creative freedom.\n\nDespite its low popularity among the general public, ''Krazy Kat'' gained a wide following among intellectuals. In 1922, a [[jazz]] [[ballet]] based on the comic was produced and scored by [[John Alden Carpenter]]; though the performance played to sold-out crowds on two nights<ref>Blackbeard 1\u20133.</ref> and was given positive reviews in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'',<ref name = \"McDonnell 66-7\">McDonnell, O'Connell and De Havenon 66\u201367.</ref> it failed to boost the strip's popularity as Hearst had hoped. In addition to Seldes and Cummings, contemporary admirers of ''Krazy Kat'' included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[H. L. Mencken]], and [[Jack Kerouac]].<ref name=\"MOD 26\"/> More recent scholars and authors have seen the strip as reflecting the [[Dada]] movement<ref>Inge.</ref> and prefiguring [[postmodernism]].<ref name=\"Shannon\"/><ref name=\"Bloom\">Bloom.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1935, ''Krazy Kat''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Sunday edition was published in full color. Though the number of newspapers carrying it dwindled in its last decade, Herriman continued to draw ''Krazy Kat''\u2014creating roughly 3,000 cartoons\u2014until his death in April 1944 (the final page was published exactly two months later, on June 25). Hearst promptly canceled the strip after the artist died, because, contrary to the common practice of the time, he did not want to see a new cartoonist take over.<ref>Schwartz 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n=== Animated adaptations ===\n[[File:Krazy Kat Bugologist 1916 silent.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=4|The title card of this 1916 silent short read ''Krazy Kat \u2013 Bugologist''. A Cartoon By George Herriman. Animated by [[Frank Moser (artist)|Frank Moser]].\" Length 3m24s, 416kbit/s]]\nThe comic strip was animated several times (see filmography below).  The earliest ''Krazy Kat'' shorts were produced by Hearst in 1916. They were produced under [[Hearst-Vitagraph News Pictorial]] and later the [[International Film Service]] (IFS), though Herriman was not involved. In 1920, after a two-year hiatus, the [[Bray Productions|John R. Bray studio]] began producing a second series of ''Krazy Kat'' shorts.<ref name=\"Crafton\">Crafton.</ref> These cartoons hewed close to the comic strips, including Ignatz, Pupp and other standard supporting characters. Krazy's ambiguous gender and feelings for Ignatz were usually preserved; bricks were occasionally thrown.  With added sound effects and music, these cartoons were in periodic reissue during the 1930s and 1940s, and ended up being syndicated to television in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1925, animation pioneer [[Bill Nolan (animator)|Bill Nolan]] decided to bring Krazy to the screen again.  Nolan intended to produce the series under Associated Animators, but when it dissolved, he sought distribution from [[Margaret J. Winkler]]. Unlike earlier adaptations, Nolan did not base his shorts on the characters and setting of the Herriman comic strip. Instead, the feline in Nolan's cartoons was a male cat whose design and personality both reflected [[Felix the Cat]].  This is probably due to the fact that Nolan himself was a former employee of the [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]] studio.<ref>Maltin 205\u201306.</ref> Other Herriman characters appeared in the Nolan cartoons at first, though similarly altered: Kwakk Wakk was at times Krazy's paramour,<ref>Winkler Productions: copyright synopsis for ''Web Feet'' (1927).</ref> with Ignatz often the bully trying to break up the romance.<ref>''Rail Rode''.</ref> Over time, Nolan's influence waned and new directors, Ben Harrison and Manny Gould, took over the series. By late 1927, they were solely in charge.\n\nWinkler's husband, [[Charles B. Mintz]], slowly began assuming control of the operation. Mintz and his studio began producing the cartoons in sound beginning with 1929's ''[[Ratskin]]''. In 1930, he moved the staff to [[California]] and ultimately changed the design of Krazy Kat. The new character bore even less resemblance to the one in the newspapers. Mintz's Krazy Kat was, like many other early 1930s cartoon characters, imitative of [[Mickey Mouse]], and usually engaged in slapstick comic adventures with his look-alike girlfriend and loyal pet dog.<ref>Maltin 207.</ref> In 1936, animator [[Isadore Klein]], with the blessing of Mintz, set to work creating the short, ''[[Lil' Ainjil]]'', the only Mintz work that was intended to reflect Herriman's comic strip. However, Klein was \"terribly disappointed\" with the resulting cartoon, and the Mickey-derivative Krazy returned.<ref>Maltin 210\u201311.</ref>  In 1939, Mintz became indebted to his distributor, [[Columbia Pictures]], and subsequently sold his studio to them.<ref>Maltin 213.</ref>  The studio produced only one more Krazy Kat cartoon, ''[[The Mouse Exterminator]]'' in 1940 as part of their [[Phantasies]] series. In the 1960's, some of the shorts were Colorized by [[Fred Ladd]] and released on Super 8mm.<ref name=\"Columbia\">[http://columbia.goldenagecartoons.com/history/screen/  Screen Gems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807202522/http://columbia.goldenagecartoons.com/history/screen/ |date=August 7, 2009 }}, The Columbia Crow's Nest \u2014 Columbia Cartoon History.</ref>\n\nKing Features produced 50 ''Krazy Kat'' cartoons from 1962\u20131964, most of which were created at [[Gene Deitch]]'s [[Rembrandt Films]] in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now the Czech Republic), whilst the rest were produced by Artransa Film Studios in Sydney, Australia.  The cartoons were initially televised interspersed with ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' (some of which were also produced by Artransa) and ''[[Snuffy Smith]]'' cartoons to form a half-hour TV show.  These cartoons helped to introduce Herriman's cat to the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom generation]]. The King Features shorts were made for television and have a closer connection to the comic strip; the backgrounds are drawn in a similar style, Ignatz was present and once again the reluctant object of Krazy's affection. This incarnation of Krazy was made female; Penny Phillips voiced Krazy<ref>{{Cite episode|series=To Tell the Truth|series-link=To Tell the Truth|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 3, 1964|minutes=24||quote=My name is Penny Phillips and I'm the cartoon voice of Krazy Kat}}. Rebroadcast on [[Buzzr]] on February 16, 2019.</ref> while [[Paul Frees]] voiced Ignatz. The recurring character Officer Bull Pupp also appeared often in this series, though his love of Krazy did not play a role in very many of the stories. [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]] did the music for most of the [[List of Krazy Kat episodes|episodes]].<ref name =\"Crafton\"/>  Most of the episodes are available on DVD.\n\n=== A \"Kounterfeit Krazy\" ===\nIn 1951, [[Dell Publishing]] revived the characters for a run of comic books.

Krazy is male in this version of the strip while Ignatz is female. This \"Krazy Kat\" also made several one-shot appearances in Dell's ''[[Four Color Comics]]'' series, from 1953 through 1956 (#454, 504, 548, 619, 696,)<ref>{{cite web|title=Dell Four Color Comics |url=http://www.dellfourcolorcomics.com/Comics/DellFourColor/DellFour-ColorSeries2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721005015/http://www.dellfourcolorcomics.com/Comics/DellFourColor/DellFour-ColorSeries2/ |archivedate=July 21, 2009 }}</ref> and was reprinted in some [[Gold Key Comics|Gold Key]] and Page Comics over the next decade.\n\n== Chronology of formats ==\nThe strip went through several format changes during its run, each of which impacted the artwork and the narratives that the form of the strip could accommodate.  What follows are the landmarks, which can also help to date the era of a given strip.\n\n* '''July 26, 1910:''' First \"beaning\" of Kat by Mouse at bottom of ''[[The Dingbat Family]]''. Strip is not sectioned off, but a detail at the bottom of the panels. Strip as a whole tended to run 4&nbsp;inches \u00d7 13&nbsp;inches.  Soon the Kat and Mouse were a five-panel 1\u00bd inch strip at the bottom of the cartoon.<ref name=\"MOD 55\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 55.</ref>\n* '''1911:'''  First brief run of ''Krazy and I. Mouse'' standalone strips (probably as a replacement to ''The Family Upstairs'').  Also, the characters briefly take over the strip for a couple of periods in '''1912''' (at least once, while the Dingbats are \"on holiday\" in '''July 1912'''.)\n* '''October 28, 1913.'''  ''Krazy Kat'' debuts as a five-panel daily vertical strip which runs down the side of a full comics page. This remains its daily format until sometime in 1920.<ref name=\"MOD 57\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 57.</ref>\n* '''April 23, 1916:'''  First black and white full page Sunday strip.\n* '''March 4&nbsp;\u2013 October 30, 1920:'''  The \"Panoramic Dailies\" period, where Herriman is allowed to experiment wildly in an unbroken daily horizontal 3 \u00d7 13&nbsp;inch space.\n* '''November 1920 on:'''  Herriman is constrained to a more conventional daily horizontal format containing three equal split sections, with the center section further split in two.  This allows the strip to be run full page, half page or a third of a page, according to editorial whim.  From September 13 to October 15, 1921, Herriman regains some control (no split center section) and resumes the previous years' format experiments.\n* '''January 7&nbsp;\u2013 March 11, 1922:''' In the ''New York Journal'', 10 weeks of Saturday full-page color strips, in addition to the ongoing Sunday full page black-and-white strips. (In other words, two original full-page strips every week).  This is then canceled due to its lack of noticeable commercial success, compared to the new Saturday color sections in out-of-town Hearst papers which contained no ''Krazy Kat.''<ref>''A Katnip Kantata in the Key of K'', 1\u20133</ref>\n* '''August 1925 to September 1929:''' Sundays are confined to 3-row, split-middle-line format allowing some papers to reduce cartoon's size and reformat into two daily-sized rows.<ref name=\"MOD 77\">McDonnell/O'Connell/De Havenon 77.</ref>\n* '''Summer 1934:''' Full page Sunday strips cease entirely, for roughly a year.\n* '''June 1, 1935:'''  Full page Sunday strips resume, now in color, until Herriman's death.\n* '''December 11, 1938:''' \"Optional\" horizontal panel begins running on bottom of Sunday strips, as placeholder for potential advertising.\n* '''June 25, 1944:''' Final Sunday strip published.\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1934, the live action film ''[[Babes in Toyland (1934 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' starring [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]] the cat playing the fiddle ([[Peter Gordon (actor)|Peter Gordon]]) is repeatedly hit in the head with a brick by a mouse (a capuchin monkey) costumed to look similar to Disney's [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>McDonnell, Patrick, ''Krazy Kat.

Jackson]] Krazy Kat, Ignatz Mouse and Officer Pup make an appearance printed on a pale blue T-Shirt worn by Jackson's character Jules who had to hastily change his clothes after an accidental in car shooting. \n\nIn 1999, ''Krazy Kat'' was rated #1 in a ''[[The Comics Journal|Comics Journal]]'' list of the best American comics of the 20th century; the list included both [[comic book]]s and comic strips.<ref>[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2302 \"Kreem of the Komics!\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908064542/http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2302 |date=2012-09-08 }}, ''Detroit Metrotimes''.

The Netherlands' Real Free Press published five issues of ''Krazy Kat Komix'' in 1974\u20131976, containing a few hundred strips apiece; each of the issues' covers was designed by [[Joost Swarte]].  However, owing to the difficulty of tracking down high-quality copies of the original newspapers, no plans for a comprehensive collection of ''Krazy Kat'' strips surfaced until the 1980s.\n\nAll of the [[Sunday strip]]s from 1916 to 1924 were reprinted by [[Eclipse Comics]] in cooperation with Turtle Island Press. The intent was to eventually reprint every Sunday ''Krazy Kat'', but this planned series was aborted when Eclipse ceased business in 1992. Beginning in 2002, [[Fantagraphics]] resumed reprinting Sunday ''Krazy Kat''s where Eclipse left off; in 2008, their tenth release completed the run with 1944.

The 1922 and 1923 books skipped a small number of strips, which have now been reprinted by ''[[Comics Revue]]''. ''Comics Revue'' also published all of the daily strips from September 8, 1930 through December 31, 1934. In 2007, Fantagraphics offered a one-shot reprint of daily strips from 1910s and 1920s, and plans a more complete reprinting of the daily strip in the future.\n\nScattered Sundays and dailies have appeared in several collections, including the [[Grosset & Dunlap]] book reprinted by [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]], but the most readily available sampling of Sundays and dailies from throughout the strip's run is ''Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman'', published by [[Harry N.
