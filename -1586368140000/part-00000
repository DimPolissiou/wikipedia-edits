Ruyin was classified as part of the ancient province of [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yuzhou]]. In the early [[Han Dynasty]], Ruyin was ruled by [[Xiahou Ying]] (d. 172 BCE), who fought alongside [[Liu Bang]] against the warlord [[Xiang Yu]] in the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] (206\u2013202 BC), and helped Liu Bang establish the Han dynasty. Following the establishment of the Han dynasty, the title conferred upon Xiahou Ying was \"Lord of Ruyin\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u6c5d\u9670\u4faf}}). The second Lord of Ruyin was Xiahou Ying's son, [[Xiahou Zao]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u590f\u4faf\u7076}}) (d. 165 BCE), whose tomb was later rediscovered in Fuyang in 1977.<ref name=\"sh_2014\">{{citation|last=Shaughnessy|first=Edward L.|year=2014|title=Unearthing the ''Changes'': Recently Discovered Manuscripts of the ''Yi Jing'' (''I Ching'') and Related Texts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfQYBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA190 |location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-16184-8}}</ref>\n\n===Shuanggudui===\n\nThe site of the second Lord of Ruyin's tomb, called [[Shuanggudui]], was rediscovered in 1977 when Fuyang's municipal airport was undergoing an expansion.<ref name=\"sh_2014\"/> Two tombs were found, although only one contained texts. Much like [[Mawangdui]], important classical Chinese texts were found at Shuanggudui that shed new light on ancient Chinese culture and literature. Texts recorded on bamboo strips were found at Shuanggudui, including the ''[[Yijing]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', ''[[Cang Jie Pian]]'' (primer), ''Classic for Physiognomizing Dogs'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u76f8\u72d7\u7d93}}), tables of historical annals, studies of myriad phenomena ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u842c\u7269}}), a text on the motions of [[qi]] ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u884c\u6c23}}), and others.<ref name=\"sh_2014\"/>\n\n===Ouyang Xiu===\n\n[[Ouyang Xiu]] died in 1072 in present-day Fuyang, Anhui. His influence was so great, even opponents like [[Wang Anshi]] wrote moving tributes on his behalf. Wang referred to him as the greatest literary figure of his age.\n\n===Red Turban Rebellion===\n\nIn the fourteenth century, [[Han Shantong]] sought to overthrow the ruling [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]]. Han styled himself as the \"Great King of Light,\" claiming to be an incarnation of [[Maitreya|Maitreya Bodhisattva]], and heir to the preceding [[Song dynasty]].<ref name=\"crimson_rain_p50\">Rowe, William.

Iron wire was used to pierce the ears of 'bad elements', while women were stripped and suspended by their hair. In the words of a leader in Jieshou county, 'their breasts were twisted until liquid oozed out'. In Linquan, the use of violence was summarised as follows by the local party boss: 'People died in tragic circumstances, being beaten and hanged to death, deprived of food or buried alive. Some were severely tortured and beaten, having their ears chopped off, their noses dug out, their mouths torn off, and so on, which often caused death. We discovered how extremely serious all of this was once we started investigating.' Murder was common. In Dahuangzhuang, a small village in Linquan, nine out of nineteen cadres had killed at least one villager during the famine. Li Fengying, a team leader, killed five people.}}\n\nIn some cases the violence was directly related to starvation, as in one case in Funan county in 1959:<ref name=\"mgf_2010_p319\"/>\n\n{{quote|In late 1959, at the height of the famine, one of the food processing factories belonging to the local grain bureau in Funan county left bean cakes in a courtyard with the gates wide open. As starving farmers tried to pilfer the food, the gates were suddenly locked behind them. 'Some of those who were caught were forced into a grain sack that was tied at the end. Then they were beaten with iron bars. The sacks were covered in blood. Others had their faces carved by knives and then oil rubbed into the wounds.'}}\n\nSince the 1980s there has been greater official Chinese recognition of the importance of policy mistakes in causing the disaster, and the Party has acknowledged that the disaster was caused mainly by gross mismanagement, using the expression, \"Three parts [[natural disaster]] and seven parts [[Anthropogenic hazard|man-made disaster]].\"<ref>Yang, Jisheng, Edward Friedman, Jian Guo, and Stacy Mosher.

The government in Fuyang, which at that time was headed by Wang Huaizhong ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u738b\u6000\u5fe0}}), encouraged rural villagers to sell blood as a way to supplement their income.<ref name=\"deep_china_88_89\">Kleinman, Arthur.

As one woman from Fuyang recalls:<ref name=\"deep_china_88_89\"/>\n\n{{quote|We sold blood because we were poor. Wang Huaizhong was in power at that time and the government under him demanded that each farmer pay an extra agricultural tax. If you failed to pay, the officials would take away your pigs, corn, and grain. So the harvest was only good enough for a basic living. But keeping children at school was expensive. [[Bribery|Giving out gifts every year]] cost a family nearly ten thousand yuan. [[Bride price|Building rooms to bring in a wife]] cost thirty thousand to forty thousand yuan. But if the government did not encourage blood selling, we would not have sold blood to make money.}}\n\nIn a 2004 epidemiological survey of Fuyang, it was found that at least three thousand farmers had conducted HIV due to the blood trade.<ref name=\"deep_china_88_89\"/>\n\nThe Fuyang [[AIDS]] [[Orphan]] Salvation Association ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u961c\u9633\u5e02\u827e\u6ecb\u75c5\u8d2b\u56f0\u513f\u7ae5\u6551\u52a9\u534f\u4f1a}}) has done some relief work to help [[AIDS orphan]]s in Fuyang.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinahumanrights.org/Messages/feature/33/t20091203_600508.htm|title=Orphanage workers ease the plight of China's AIDS children|publisher=China Human Rights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/fight-against-discrimination/education-of-children-in-need/projects-by-region/asia-and-the-pacific/china-aids-orphans-salvation-association-of-fuyang-aos/|title=China - Aids Orphans Salvation Association of Fuyang (AOS)|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> The 2006 short film, ''[[The Blood of Yingzhou District]]'', documents the many challenges faced by AIDS orphans living in rural parts of Fuyang's Yingzhou district.\n\nWang Huaizhong, who promoted blood selling in Fuyang in the early 1990s, was later promoted to deputy governor of Anhui province.<ref name=\"deep_china_88_89\"/> However, in 2001, he was arrested for taking bribes.<ref name=\"wang_huaizhong_20031230\">{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/30/content_294409.htm| title=Anhui vice-governor gets death penalty| publisher=China Daily| date=2003-12-30| accessdate=2015-07-10}}</ref> He was later convicted of accepting bribes totaling 5.17 million yuan, and having 4.8 million yuan of unaccountable assets.

The site of Xiahou Zao's tomb became known as [[Shuanggudui]]]]\n\n===Early Ruyin===\n\nStarting with the [[Qin dynasty]], the region now called Fuyang was called Ruyin (\u6c5d\u9670). Ruyin was classified as part of the ancient province of [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yuzhou]]. In the early [[Han Dynasty]], Ruyin was ruled by [[Xiahou Ying]] (d. 172 BCE), who fought alongside [[Liu Bang]] against the warlord [[Xiang Yu]] in the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] (206\u2013202 BC), and helped Liu Bang establish the Han dynasty. Following the establishment of the Han dynasty, the title conferred upon Xiahou Ying was \"Lord of Ruyin\" (\u6c5d\u9670\u4faf). The second Lord of Ruyin was Xiahou Ying's son, [[Xiahou Zao]] (\u590f\u4faf\u7076) (d. 165 BCE), whose tomb was later rediscovered in Fuyang in 1977.<ref name=\"sh_2014\">{{citation|last=Shaughnessy|first=Edward L.|year=2014|title=Unearthing the ''Changes'': Recently Discovered Manuscripts of the ''Yi Jing'' (''I Ching'') and Related Texts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfQYBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA190 |location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-16184-8}}</ref>\n\n===Shuanggudui===\n\nThe site of the second Lord of Ruyin's tomb, called [[Shuanggudui]], was rediscovered in 1977 when Fuyang's municipal airport was undergoing an expansion.<ref name=\"sh_2014\"/> Two tombs were found, although only one contained texts. Much like [[Mawangdui]], important classical Chinese texts were found at Shuanggudui that shed new light on ancient Chinese culture and literature. Texts recorded on bamboo strips were found at Shuanggudui, including the ''[[Yijing]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', ''[[Cang Jie Pian]]'' (primer), ''Classic for Physiognomizing Dogs'' (\u76f8\u72d7\u7d93), tables of historical annals, studies of myriad phenomena (\u842c\u7269), a text on the motions of [[qi]] (\u884c\u6c23), and others.<ref name=\"sh_2014\"/>\n\n===Ouyang Xiu===\n\n[[Ouyang Xiu]] died in 1072 in present-day Fuyang, Anhui. His influence was so great, even opponents like [[Wang Anshi]] wrote moving tributes on his behalf. Wang referred to him as the greatest literary figure of his age.\n\n===Red Turban Rebellion===\n\nIn the fourteenth century, [[Han Shantong]] sought to overthrow the ruling [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]]. Han styled himself as the \"Great King of Light,\" claiming to be an incarnation of [[Maitreya|Maitreya Bodhisattva]], and heir to the preceding [[Song dynasty]].<ref name=\"crimson_rain_p50\">Rowe, William.

Some were severely tortured and beaten, having their ears chopped off, their noses dug out, their mouths torn off, and so on, which often caused death. We discovered how extremely serious all of this was once we started investigating.' Murder was common. In Dahuangzhuang, a small village in Linquan, nine out of nineteen cadres had killed at least one villager during the famine. Li Fengying, a team leader, killed five people.}}\n\nIn some cases the violence was directly related to starvation, as in one case in Funan county in 1959:<ref name=\"mgf_2010_p319\"/>\n\n{{quote|In late 1959, at the height of the famine, one of the food processing factories belonging to the local grain bureau in Funan county left bean cakes in a courtyard with the gates wide open. As starving farmers tried to pilfer the food, the gates were suddenly locked behind them. 'Some of those who were caught were forced into a grain sack that was tied at the end. Then they were beaten with iron bars. The sacks were covered in blood. Others had their faces carved by knives and then oil rubbed into the wounds.'}}\n\nSince the 1980s there has been greater official Chinese recognition of the importance of policy mistakes in causing the disaster, and the Party has acknowledged that the disaster was caused mainly by gross mismanagement, using the expression, \"Three parts [[natural disaster]] and seven parts [[Anthropogenic hazard|man-made disaster]].\"<ref>Yang, Jisheng, Edward Friedman, Jian Guo, and Stacy Mosher.

As one woman from Fuyang recalls:<ref name=\"deep_china_88_89\"/>\n\n{{quote|We sold blood because we were poor. Wang Huaizhong was in power at that time and the government under him demanded that each farmer pay an extra agricultural tax.

UXO does not always originate from wars; areas such as military training grounds can also hold significant numbers, even after the area has been abandoned. UXO from World War I continue to be a hazard, with poisonous gas filled munitions still a problem. When unwanted munitions are found, they are sometimes destroyed in controlled explosions, but accidental detonation of even very old explosives also occurs, sometimes with fatal results.\n\nSeventy-eight countries are contaminated by land mines, which kill or maim 15,000\u201320,000 people every year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/french/protection/files/Landmines_Factsheet_04_LTR_HD.pdf|title=Children and Landmines: A Deadly Legacy|last=UNICEF|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Approximately 80% of casualties are civilian, with children the most affected age group.

Having failed to explode while resting undiscovered is no guarantee that a bomb will not explode when disturbed. Such discoveries are common in heavily bombed cities, without a serious enough threat to warrant systematic searching.\n\nWhere there is known to be much unexploded ordnance, in cases of unexploded subsoil ordnance a remote investigation is done by visual interpretation of available historical aerial photographs. Modern techniques can combine geophysical and survey methods with modern electromagnetic and magnetic detectors.  This provides digital mapping of UXO contamination with the aim to better target subsequent excavations, reducing the cost of digging on every metallic contact and speeding the clearance process. [[Magnetometer]] probes can detect UXO and provide geotechnical data before drilling or piling is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geosoft.com/resources/casestudies/index.asp#uxo|title=Success Stories|publisher=Geosoft|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serdp.org/|title=Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, Environmental Security Technology Certification Program|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> Department of Defense programs fund research into the detection and discrimination of UXO from scrap metal.

But if the bomb is buried it becomes a huge task.

UXO does not always originate from wars; areas such as military training grounds can also hold significant numbers, even after the area has been abandoned.

Having failed to explode while resting undiscovered is no guarantee that a bomb will not explode when disturbed. Such discoveries are common in heavily bombed cities, without a serious enough threat to warrant systematic searching.\n\nWhere there is known to be much unexploded ordnance, in cases of unexploded subsoil ordnance a remote investigation is done by visual interpretation of available historical aerial photographs. Modern techniques can combine geophysical and survey methods with modern electromagnetic and magnetic detectors.  This provides digital mapping of UXO contamination with the aim to better target subsequent excavations, reducing the cost of digging on every metallic contact and speeding the clearance process. [[Magnetometer]] probes can detect UXO and provide geotechnical data before drilling or piling is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geosoft.com/resources/casestudies/index.asp#uxo|title=Success Stories|publisher=Geosoft|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serdp.org/|title=Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, Environmental Security Technology Certification Program|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> Department of Defense programs fund research into the detection and discrimination of UXO from scrap metal. Much of the cost of UXO removal comes from removing non-explosive items that the metal detectors have identified, so improved discrimination is critical. New techniques such as shape reconstruction from magnetic data and better de-noising techniques will reduce cleanup costs and enhance recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serdp.org/Program-Areas/Munitions-Response/Land|title=Land|publisher=Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program, Environmental Security Technology Certification Program|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109220603/http://www.serdp.org/Program-Areas/Munitions-Response/Land|archivedate=9 January 2014}}</ref>\nThe Interstate Technology & Regulatory Council published a Geophysical Classification for Munitions Response guidance document in August 2015.<ref name=itrc>{{cite web|title=Geophysical Classification for Munitions Response Fact Sheets (GCMR-1)|url=http://itrcweb.org/GuidanceDocuments/GCMR-1.pdf|publisher=Interstate Technology & Regulatory Council|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\nUXO or UXBs (as they are called in some countries \u2013 unexploded bombs) are broadly classified into buried and unburied. The disposal team carries out reconnaissance of the area and determines the location of the ordnance. If is not buried it may be dug up carefully and disposed of. But if the bomb is buried it becomes a huge task.
