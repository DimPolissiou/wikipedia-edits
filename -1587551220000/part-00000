Along with [[Gichin Funakoshi]] and [[Masatoshi Nakayama]], Okazaki helped found the [[Japan Karate Association]]'s instructor training program.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nOkazaki was born in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] [[Japan]]. As a young man, he grew up studying [[judo]], [[kendo]], and [[aikido]]. In 1948, at the age of sixteen, he entered [[Takushoku University]]. It was here that Okazaki began his [[karate]] training. Teruyuki Okazaki studied primarily under Gichin Funakoshi, as well as Masatoshi Nakayama. In 1953, Okazaki graduated and was immediately appointed coach of the Takushoku team. Later that year, it was decided that Okazaki would be trained as a \"test case\" for the still formulating [[Japan Karate Association|JKA]] Instructor Trainee Program. In 1955, he was appointed head of the program, which produced some of modern Shotokan's most integral leaders. [[Takayuki Mikami]], [[Eiji Takaura]], and [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] were among the first graduates from this program.\n\n===Coming to North America===\n\nAs part of an effort by [[Masatoshi Nakayama|Nakayama]] to spread the practice of Shotokan karate internationally, Okazaki came to the [[United States]] in 1961. Originally planning to stay only six months, he later opened a [[dojo]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and settled there permanently.<ref>[https://iskf.com/masters/ International Shotokan Karate Federation]</ref> In 1977, Okazaki founded the International Shotokan Karate Federation.\n\n===ISKF Independence===\n\nIn April 2007 Okazaki proposed, as chief instructor of the ISKF, termination of the ISKF's relationship with the JKA and formed an external independent body.

As a young man, he grew up studying [[judo]], [[kendo]], and [[aikido]]. In 1948, at the age of sixteen, he entered [[Takushoku University]]. It was here that Okazaki began his [[karate]] training. Teruyuki Okazaki studied primarily under Gichin Funakoshi, as well as Masatoshi Nakayama. In 1953, Okazaki graduated and was immediately appointed coach of the Takushoku team. Later that year, it was decided that Okazaki would be trained as a \"test case\" for the still formulating [[Japan Karate Association|JKA]] Instructor Trainee Program. In 1955, he was appointed head of the program, which produced some of modern Shotokan's most integral leaders. [[Takayuki Mikami]], [[Eiji Takaura]], and [[Hirokazu Kanazawa]] were among the first graduates from this program.\n\n===Coming to North America===\n\nAs part of an effort by [[Masatoshi Nakayama|Nakayama]] to spread the practice of Shotokan karate internationally, Okazaki came to the [[United States]] in 1961.

In the area of [[special effect]]s, it is used in [[pyrotechnics]] explosions and dust clouds, because it spreads farther and higher than most natural soils, resulting in a blast that looks larger. It is also safer than naturally occurring soil, should the blast spray hit actors.

However, health concerns in this regard have been debated.<ref>Pickut, Walt (16 July 2015) [http://www.livestrong.com/article/188651-fullers-earth-health-effects/ Fuller's Earth Health Effects]. livestrong.com</ref> Fuller's earth is available in small quantities by make-up suppliers for use in making the face and body appear dirty. It is used by props technicians to make furniture look dusty. Wardrobe dressers use a small, loose-mesh cloth bag filled with fuller's earth to apply it to clothing to make it appear dusty. Set dressers use fuller's earth to change paved streets into dirt roads, to create dust trailing from a moving vehicle over a dirt road, or to indicate a vehicle trail over untravelled ground.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Sepiolite]]\n* [[Medicinal clay]]\n* [[Kaolinite]]\n\n== References ==\n\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n\n* Brady, G.S., Clauser, H.R., & Vaccari, J.A.
