It was published by [[Hakusensha]] in the monthly manga magazine ''[[Bessatsu Hana to Yume]]'' from its November 2003 issue to its January 2015 one. It is a sequel to ''[[Please Save My Earth]]'', one of Hiwatari's previous works, and features the two focus characters of that series, Alice Sakaguchi (now Kobayashi) and Rin Kobayashi. They are married, and their child, seven-year-old Ren, is the main character of the series. Many of the characters from ''Please Save My Earth'' reappear in this one. It also reprises a lot of the [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]-related themes that the original series dealt with. The series was collected into 15 volumes. A sequel titled ''I Sing with the Earth'' has been running in ''Bessatsu Hana to Yume'' since March 2015.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main Characters===\n\n* '''Ren Kobayashi'''\n\nRin and Alice's 7-year-old son (he later turns 8). Born four years after the ending of ''Please Save My Earth'', Rin was 16 and Alice was 25 when Ren was born, and they married two years later. He resembles Rin in appearance and personality. Unlike his parents, Ren possesses no psychic abilities, unless he is in the presence of Shion and Mokuren, whom he considers as his guardian angels and thinks of them as secondary parents. At the end of the series, it is discovered that Ren is the reincarnation of Ryouji, Mokuren's father. He is an outgoing, cheerful, and adventurous young boy who is always by the side of his best friend, Kachiko, who Ren seems to have romantic feelings for, although he tends to deny it because he is embarrassed or doesn't recognize his feelings as something more than friendship. He loves both of his parents deeply and is protective of them. It is revealed his father, Rin, named him after Mokuren. In later chapters, it turns out he does possess psychic abilities that had been in a dormant state since his birth, and awakened when he was able to see his father's role in the events of the first series. This causes him to develop a split personality disorder, which Shion and Mokuren help him keep under control by telling him how his existence is treasured by them and the planet. In return, he vows that he will be the person who can protect the Earth.\n\n* '''Rin Kobayashi'''\n\nRen's father and Alice's husband. He is 23 years old (later 24). When he was 15, he discovered that Alice was pregnant with his child, and he was 16 when Ren was born. He was the one who chose the name \"Ren\" in honor of Mokuren. Rin married Alice two years later, as soon as he turned 18. Although he is an adult, Rin still retains his playful and childish personality, but he can be serious and perceptive when necessary. He is a loving husband to Alice and father to Ren. In chapter 38, it is discovered that Alice is pregnant with their second child, which will be a girl and Ren names his daughter Chimako. In the later part of the series, it is discovered that due to Shion subconsciously giving his powers to the unborn Chimako, Rin will die five years in the future. However, due to interference by Ren and Chiyako from the future, they are able to save Rin and he will live a long life with his family. He is a freelance composer but does part time jobs when he can't find work. He is the reincarnation of Shion.\n\n* '''Alice Kobayashi (n\u00e9e Sakaguchi)'''\n\nRen's mother and Rin's wife. She is now 32 years old (later 33). When she was 24 and Rin was 15, she became pregnant with his child and gave birth to their son Ren at age 25. When Ren was about two years old, Alice and Rin got married. She is a loving wife to Rin and mother to Ren. She worries about Ren developing his own psychic abilities, as she is afraid her son will endure similar hardships she and Rin endured in the original series. In chapter 38, it is revealed that she is pregnant with their second child, which will be a girl named Chimako. She is a vocalist and has a special connection to plants.  She is the reincarnation of Mokuren.\n\n* '''Shion'''\n\nThe previous life of Rin from ''Please Save My Earth''. In the events after the first series, Shion has lived in peace with Mokuren and watching over Rin, Alice, and Ren as spirits. Shion is fond of Ren and treats the boy as his own son due to his and Mokuren's inability to have children. When Ren's psychic abilities awaken and he has difficulty controlling them, Shion tells him that he is the one meant to protect the Earth, which inspires Ren to promise him and Mokuren that he will do his best. when Alice becomes pregnant with her and Rin's second child, Shion subconsciously sent his powers to the child, allowing it to take on his physical appearance, even though the child turns out to be a girl. Mokuren speculates that the child, whom Rin names Chimako, is the daughter that Shion has always dreamed of having. On a side note, he is fond of Japanese culture, particularly manga and video games. He also once took over Rin's body periodically to spend more time with Ren, with Rin not noticing and even having no memory of the incidents and becoming angry with Shion when he found out. Rin forbids Shion from seeing Ren once Ren starts losing control of his psychic powers and develops a spoilt personality as a result of experiencing his father's old memories but promises Shion he can see Ren when he grows up and learns to control his powers.\n\n* '''Mokuren'''\n\nThe previous life of Alice from ''Please Save My Earth''. After the ending of the first series, Mokuren was able to live happily with Shion, and together, as spirits, have been watching over Rin, Alice, and Ren. She still retains a close connection with Alice, offering her important facts on serious situations in the later part of the series. Mokuren loves Ren as if he was her own son due to that she is unable to have children, and along with Shion, helps Ren learn how to control his newly awakening psychic powers and encourages him to be the one who can protect Earth.\n\n===Secondary Characters===\n* '''Kachiko Yakushimaru'''\n\nRen's best friend. She possesses psychic abilities, like being able to see spirits or gouls. She is known for her stubborn and prideful personality, which often puts her at odds with Ren, who's cheerful and outgoing personality irritates her. She often criticizes him for his mistakes, but it is clear that she truly cares about him and worries about him often. It is revealed that Kachiko was conceived when her biological mother, named Pamela, offered to give Mikuro a child for him to raise on his own. She later meets her mother and develops a mother-daughter bond with her. She develops a crush on Ren, although she tends to deny it out of embarrassment.\n\n* '''Mikuro Yakushimaru'''\n\nKachiko's father and former main character from ''Please Save My Earth''. Possessing ESP, he works for EPIA and lives in America, which keeps him separated from Kachiko often. Despite being estranged from her, Mikuro loves his daughter dearly. It turns out that prior to Kachiko's birth, Mikuro had wanted to have a child, and his friend Pamela offered to bear him a child without considering marriage or sharing responsibility for their daughter. When Kachiko decides to learn more about her birth and search for her mother, Mikuro agrees to take her to America to meet Pamela for the first time, thinking it is time that she should have a relationship with her mother.\n\n* '''Chimako Kobayashi'''\n\nRin and Alice's daughter and Ren's younger sister. The pregnancy with Chimako was first discovered by Mokuren who asked Ren to relate this information to Alice. Despite how difficult it was for her to give birth to Ren and the second childbirth may prove too much for her, Alice decides to have the baby and Rin chooses the name Chimako, which is what he always wanted to name his daughter and it means \"child of the Earth\". While unborn, she appears to Ren to warn him about their father's death in the future and find a way to change his fate. Due to Shion subconsciously giving his powers to her, Chimako closely resembles Shion.\n\n===Other Characters===\n* '''Tsubasa'''\n\nA classmate and friend of Ren and Kachiko. It is hinted that he has a crush on Kachiko, although he denies and believes that she and Ren like each other, much to their chagrin.\n\n* '''Sakura Nishikiyori (n\u00e9e Kokushou)\n\nA main character from ''Please Save My Earth''. In the years after the first series, she has married Issei and longs to have a child. By the beginning of the series, they have been married for five years and have been unable to conceive, leading her to fear she is infertile. Because of this, she tends to spoil Ren and lavish a lot of attention on him. Eventually, a miracle occurs when Sakura discovers she is in fact pregnant.\n\n* '''Issei Nishikiyori'''\n\nA main character from ''Please Save My Earth''. In the years after the first series, he has married Sakura and have tried unsuccessfully to have children.

In the years after the first series, he has become a successful writer. His involvement in the series is minimum, with him offering some advice to Rin on how to be honest with Alice and Ren about his problems early in the series.\n\n* '''Hajime Sakaguchi'''\n\nAlice's younger brother, thus Rin's brother-in-law and Ren's maternal uncle. Despite being an adult, he is still overprotective of his sister and still refuses to acknowledge her marriage to Rin. He was enraged when Alice became pregnant with Ren, believing Rin would eventually abandon them, and although that never happened, Hajime still doesn't trust Rin. He seems to genuinely care for Ren and is often concerned for the boy's well-being.\n\n* '''Kou Shibaura'''\n\nA former classmate of Ren's from middle school and works as a police officer. He meets with Rin after his ESP abilities begin to weaken and is interested in learning more about the Kobayashi family. For unknown reasons, he is able to see Mokuren and Shion, and can even communicate with them. He helps Rin, Alice, and Ren find a way to prevent Rin's death in the future. He is married with a one-year-old son.\n\n* '''Pamela'''\n\nKachiko's mother and former friend and lover of Mikuro. She lives in America and works at EPIA with Mikuro, although they severed contact with each other following Kachiko's birth. During his time in America, Mikuro told Pamela, who was already dating someone else, about his desire to have a child but didn't want to get married. To his surprise, Pamela offered to give birth to his child but they agreed to not enter in a committed relationship and only he would raise the child. When kachiko finds out the truth about the origins of her birth, she decides to meet her mother, and with Mikuro's blessing, she and Pamela meet and start to form their mother-daughter relationship.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{ann|manga|9276}}\n\n[[Category:2003 manga]]\n[[Category:Science fiction anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014djo manga]]\n[[Category:Hakusensha manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Embraced by the Moonlight\n| image           =\n| caption         = \n| ja_kanji        = \u30dc\u30af\u3092\u5305\u3080\u6708\u306e\u5149\n| ja_romaji       = Boku o Tsutsumu Tsuki no Hikari\n| genre           = [[Sci-Fi]]\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Print\n| type            = manga\n| author          = [[Saki Hiwatari]]\n| publisher       = [[Hakusensha]]\n| demographic     = ''[[Sh\u014djo manga|Sh\u014djo]]''\n| magazine        = [[Bessatsu Hana to Yume]]\n| first           = September 26, 2003\n| last            = November 26, 2014\n| volumes         = 15\n| volume_list     = \n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Embraced by the Moonlight'''''|\u30dc\u30af\u3092\u5305\u3080\u6708\u306e\u5149|Boku o Tsutsumu Tsuki no Hikari|lead=yes}} is a [[science fiction]] [[manga]] series by [[Saki Hiwatari]].

Decisions concerning the curriculum and relationships will be based on these values.  The Governors will expect applicants to contribute to the development and maintenance of this ethos. <br/><br/>\nThe basic aim of the school is to serve the children of the community educationally, pastorally and spiritually, and to develop in each individual student a full range of academic, sporting and cultural talents; to develop within the school a true sense of community spirit which will form a foundation for the students\u2019 future lives in the wider community, and to do these things in a Christian environment, enriched by our Catholic tradition.\n |salign=right|source = English Martrys School and Sixth Form College's official website <ref name=\"OfficialWebsite\">{{cite web |url=http://emshartlepool.org/ems2/index.php/about/general-information |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826205502/http://emshartlepool.org/ems2/index.php/about/general-information |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n |width  = 90%\n |align  = center\n}}\n\n==Intake==\n\n===Main School===\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20120920023159/http://www.ems.hartlepool.sch.uk/EMS/admissions.htm  ''Admissions Criteria 2013'']\n\nThe majority of secondary school students come from 6 feeder primary schools, which are:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*Sacred Heart School\n*St. Bega's School\n*St. Cuthbert's school\n*St. John Vianney's School\n*St. Joseph's School\n*St. Teresa's School\n}}\n\n===Sixth Form===\n[http://www.ems.hartlepool.sch.uk/SixthForm/EM%20Prospectus%20AW%20HiRes.pdf ''6th Form College Prospectus 2013-2014'']{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*If you obtain 5 grade Cs or better at [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] then you can choose any Level 3 course i.e. an [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] or an Applied A Level course\n*If you obtain 4 grade Cs or above at GCSE then you are advised to follow a double award Applied A Level course, plus additional AS subject/s\n*If you obtain fewer than 4 grade Cs at GCSE then you are advised to follow a Level 2 course&nbsp;\u2013 either the BTEC First Diploma in Business or in Health and Social Care\n\n==Houses==\nThere are five houses within the school: St John Boste, St Margaret Clitherow, Blessed John Ingram, St Anne Line and St Thomas More.

The school had approximately 200 students and the headmasters were Mr Timothy McCarthy, followed by Mr Robert Garraghan.<ref name=\"HHTandN\" />\n\nIn 1973, the national policy of Comprehensive education led to all the Catholic secondary schools in the town being merged as the '''English Martyrs' Comprehensive School'''.

Decisions concerning the curriculum and relationships will be based on these values.  The Governors will expect applicants to contribute to the development and maintenance of this ethos. <br/><br/>\nThe basic aim of the school is to serve the children of the community educationally, pastorally and spiritually, and to develop in each individual student a full range of academic, sporting and cultural talents; to develop within the school a true sense of community spirit which will form a foundation for the students\u2019 future lives in the wider community, and to do these things in a Christian environment, enriched by our Catholic tradition.\n |salign=right|source = English Martrys School and Sixth Form College's official website <ref name=\"OfficialWebsite\">{{cite web |url=http://emshartlepool.org/ems2/index.php/about/general-information |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826205502/http://emshartlepool.org/ems2/index.php/about/general-information |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n |width  = 90%\n |align  = center\n}}\n\n==Intake==\n\n===Main School===\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20120920023159/http://www.ems.hartlepool.sch.uk/EMS/admissions.htm  ''Admissions Criteria 2013'']\n\nThe majority of secondary school students come from 6 feeder primary schools, which are:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*Sacred Heart School\n*St. Bega's School\n*St. Cuthbert's school\n*St. John Vianney's School\n*St. Joseph's School\n*St. Teresa's School\n}}\n\n===Sixth Form===\n[http://www.ems.hartlepool.sch.uk/SixthForm/EM%20Prospectus%20AW%20HiRes.pdf ''6th Form College Prospectus 2013-2014'']{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*If you obtain 5 grade Cs or better at [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] then you can choose any Level 3 course i.e. an [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] or an Applied A Level course\n*If you obtain 4 grade Cs or above at GCSE then you are advised to follow a double award Applied A Level course, plus additional AS subject/s\n*If you obtain fewer than 4 grade Cs at GCSE then you are advised to follow a Level 2 course&nbsp;\u2013 either the BTEC First Diploma in Business or in Health and Social Care\n\n==Houses==\nThere are five houses within the school: St John Boste, St Margaret Clitherow, Blessed John Ingram, St Anne Line and St Thomas More. In the same way as the earlier [[St Francis RC Grammar School]] had named its houses after the [[List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation|English Martyrs]], in 2009 the houses of the English Martyrs School were introduced and named after the following. Prior to this introduction, Saints John Boste, Margaret Clitherow, Anne Line and Thomas More all existed as houses in the school's [[Physical education|PE]] department for use during [[sports day]]s and athletics tournaments, however they were unconnected to the pastoral or academic care of pupils.\n\n===St John Boste===\n*Saint [[John Boste]] who was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in 1594.\n*House colour: {{purple|'''PURPLE'''}}\n\n===St Margaret Clitherow===\n*Saint [[Margaret Clitherow]] who was crushed to death by rocks in [[York]] in 1586 for harbouring priests.\n*House colour: {{blue|'''BLUE'''}}\n\n===Blessed John Ingram===\n*The Blessed [[John Ingram (martyr)|John Ingram]] who was executed in [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] in 1594 as a priest ordained abroad, an act of high treason.\n*House colour: {{green|'''GREEN'''}}\n\n===St Anne Line===\n*Saint [[Anne Line]] who was hung at [[Tyburn]] in 1601 for harbouring a priest.\n*House colour: {{red|'''RED'''}}\n\n===St Thomas More===\n*The Right Honourable Sir [[Thomas More]], [[Lord Chancellor]] to [[Henry VIII of England]], who was executed in 1535 and canonized in 1935 for refusing to accept the king as [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] or his marriage to [[Anne Boleyn]].\n*House colour: {{yellow|'''YELLOW'''}}\n\n==Annual School Events==\n\n===Annual Awards Evening Principal Guests 1981-2012===\nA tradition of the school since 1981 where awards are given to students of both the school and sixth form college for reasons including: \"excellent attendance, reliability, hard work, social and academic progress, caring for others, academic excellence and artistic, cultural and sporting achievements. Recognition is given to achievement at GCSE, 'A' level and GNVQ levels.\"<ref name=\"OfficialWebsite\" />\nThere are prizes donated by local individuals and groups as well as [[Huntsman Corporation|Huntsman Tioxide]], [[Teesside University]] and [[The Daily Telegraph]].\nEach year attracts over 1000 guests and a Principal Guest of Honour \"who themselves represent achievement in a range of fields\". The evening also features music by the school orchestra and individual student musicians with refreshments to end the night.\n\n===Annual School Show===\nAnother tradition of the school is an annual school musical, usually held around the end of November. This features pupils from all years, although older students and sixth formers generally get the leading roles. The music department, orchestra and drama department work together on its production. Tickets are made available to parents throughout the school to buy.\n\n===Annual John Bell Lecture===\nThis now traditional once a year lecture is usually given around March in the school's St Anne's hall. The lecture is in honour of Canon John Bell, the last headmaster of St Francis and the first headmaster of the new English Martyrs school, and lasts around 40 minutes followed by audience questions. Complimentary tickets to attend are made available free of charge.\n\n===Principal Guests, School Shows and John Bell Lecturers===\n{{Expand list|date=November 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Duncan threatens everyone by reading their darkest secrets, which were to be burned with the witch, and everyone lays off. Mia admits that she likes the festivities, but that everyone should be more aware of the history. Annie, having realized what she is doing to her son, apologizes for putting his name up as a virgin and she and Jack win the chili cook off. Kimberly awaits for a boy that she likes, but accidentally scares him away.\n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Fridgy\n| DirectedBy      = Adam Henry\n| WrittenBy       = [[John Viener]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|15}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ03\n| Viewers         = 1.17<ref name=\"1.05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-15-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.15.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 17, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The Harrises' refrigerator finally breaks down after years of use and they head to the store to buy a new one. They are greeted by Janine who presents them with a smart fridge from ConVee. The Harrises are happy with the fridge, which they name Fridgy, as it can perform all of their tasks and chores giving them ample time to do the things they have always wanted to do. However, Annie is shocked when she realizes that Fridgy keeps a tab on many of her personal things, such as having sex with Jack on the kitchen floor, and finds herself left out of the family's personal time. When she confronts Fridgy about it, it locks the Harrises in the house. They escape, but are taken to the ConVee headquarters where Janine wants them to be the family of the future. Annie gives a speech about making an effort and the family agree with her. Janine threatens to kill them, but the Harrises have the appliances fight one another and they escape the exploding base. The family dig up their old busted refrigerator and \"enjoy\" their family time together. \n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Sister, Wife\n| DirectedBy      = Chuck Sheetz\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Julie Thacker Scully & Amy Poehler|t=Andrew Lee|tfirst=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|22}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ06\n| Viewers         = 1.07<ref name=\"1.06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-22-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.22.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Jack and Annie decide to spend their anniversary by shopping at the home improvement store and take Kimberly with them, though they continuously fail to remember that she is with them.

After many failed excursions, they end up at an 80's themed bar, but Annie gets mad at Jack when he refuses to punch a guy that was hitting on her.

Despite being born into an aristocratic army family she became an activist member of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].   She worked for the party's [[Intelligence agency|intelligence service]] during the 1930s.  She was treated with on-going suspicion and subjected to a number of interrogations by the [[Gestapo |security services]] between [[Nazi Germany|1933 and 1945]], although her party intelligence involvement is confirmed only in a document dated 1973.<ref name=MLvHlautHDK>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/de/recherche/kataloge-datenbanken/biographische-datenbanken/marie-louise-von-hammerstein?ID=4419|title=Hammerstein, Marie Louise von * 27.9.1908  \u2020 6.11.1999|work=Handbuch der Deutschen Kommunisten|author1=[[Hermann Weber]]|author2=[[Andreas Herbst]] |publisher= Karl Dietz Verlag, Berlin & Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Berlin|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n=== Provenance and early years ===\nMarie-Luise C\u00e4cilie \"Butzi\" von Hammerstein-Equord was born in [[Berlin]], the eldest child of [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]] by his marriage to Maria, Baroness of L\u00fcttwitz.<ref name=genelaogyMLvHE>{{cite web|title=Marie-Luise Freiin von Hammerstein-Equord|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Marie-Luise-Freiin-von-Hammerstein-Equord/6000000040307693612 |author=Galina Lessel (compiler) |date=17 March 2020|publisher=Geni.com|accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref>  The family was well connected.   The father of Marie Luise served as head of the [[Reichswehr|German army]] between 1930 and 1933.   He was deeply opposed to the [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] but nevertheless, when he died in 1943, it was from illness.   Other family members ended the  [[Second World War|war years]] in hiding, or, like [[:de:Franz Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord|Franz]], the youngest brother of Marie Luise, as concentration camp inmates,<ref name=FvHElautGE>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/franz-von-hammerstein-geb-1921/5334420.html|date=20 October 2011|publisher=Verlag Der Tagesspiegel GmbH, Berlin|title=Franz von Hammerstein (Geb. 1921)|work=Die Fragen waren einfach.

To her mother's horror, she \"quit the [[Roman Catholic Church|church]]\" when she was 16.  In 1923 she joined the [[Wandervogel]] movement.   The Wandervogels were a nationwide youth network that combined hiking and other outdoor activities with a romanticist rejection of industrialisation and modernism in favour of old Teutonic values which on occasion overlapped with less palatable forms of German nationalism.   Through the Wandervogels she met up with [[:de:Nathan Steinberger|Nathan Steinberger]] and [[Gertrud Classen]].   Through Steinberger and Classen she came into contact with the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]], becoming a member during the first part of 1928, though still aged only 19.<ref name=MLvHlautHDK/>   Over the next few years she and her younger sister Helga passed on secret information about their father's work to the \"A-M Apparat\" (''literally \"Anti-Military Apparatus\"''), which was the intentionally misleading name of the [[Communist Party of Germany|party's]] extensive intelligence organisation in Germany.<ref name=MLvHlautHDK/>   Given Leo Roth's personal involvement with her sister Helga, it is unsurprising that Marie Luise was also in contact with Roth during the middle 1930s, but the earliest confirmation that she worked for \"Soviet intelligence\", and that her handler was [[:de:Leo Roth (Agent)|Leo Roth]], comes in the form of a [[curriculum vitae]] which she herself composed for \"internal use\" as recently as 1973.   Plans for a war of aggression against the [[Soviet Union]] existed in [[Berlin]] and were known about in Moscow in 1933, though Stalin chose to ignore them.

Originally, this name was the name applied by Central and Western Asians and Europeans to northern China; the name was also used in [[Marco Polo]]'s book on his [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travels]] in China (he referred to southern China as ''[[Names of China#Mangi|Mangi]]''). [[Odoric of Pordenone]] (d.1331) also writes about Cathay and the Khan in his travelbooks from his journey before 1330, perhaps 1321-30.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CEM-09-Asiae-Nova-Descriptio-China-2510.jpg|thumb|On this 1570 map by [[Abraham Ortelius]], ''Cataio'' is located inland of ''China'' (referring to today's [[Guangdong]]) and ''Chequan'' ([[Zhejiang]]), and borders on \"[[Tibet|Thebet]]\" in the southwest and \"[[Kumul (city)|Camul]]\" in the west.

Meanwhile, in China itself, people usually referred to their nation state based on the name of the ruling dynasty, e.g. ''[[Ming dynasty|Da Ming Guo]]'' (\"the kingdom of the Great Ming\"), or as the \"Middle Kingdom\" (''Zhongguo'' \u4e2d\u570b); see also [[Names of China]] for details.\n\nWhen the Portuguese reached South-East Asia ([[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquering [[Melaka|Malacca]] in 1511) and the southern coast of China ([[Jorge \u00c1lvares]] reaching the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] estuary in 1513), they started calling the country by the name used in South and South-East Asia.<ref>[[Matteo Ricci]], writing less than a century after the events, states: \"Today the people of [[Kochi, India|Cochin]] and the Siamese as well, from whom the Portuguese learned to call the empire China, call this country Cin\".  (Gallagher (1953), pp. 6\u20137)</ref> It was not immediately clear to the Europeans whether this ''China'' is the same country as ''Cathay'' known from [[Marco Polo]]. Therefore, it would not be uncommon for 16th-century maps to apply the label \"China\" just to the coastal region already well known to the Europeans (e.g., just [[Guangdong]] on [[Abraham Ortelius]]' 1570 map), and to place the mysterious Cathay somewhere inland.\n\n[[File:CEM-15-Asia-Mercator-1595-Tartaria-2532.jpg|thumb|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s placing of the \"Kingdom of Cathay\" (''Cathay Reg.'') on the Pacific Coast north-east of China remained typical for a number of maps published in the decades to follow]]\nIt was a small group of [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits]], led by [[Matteo Ricci]] who, being able both to travel throughout China and to read, learned about the country from Chinese books and from conversation with people of all walks of life. During his first 15 years in China (1583\u20131598) Matteo Ricci formed a strong suspicion that Marco Polo's \"Cathay\" is simply the \"Tatar\" (i.e., [[Mongol]]) name for the\ncountry he was in, i.e. China. Ricci supported his arguments by numerous correspondences between Marco Polo's accounts and his own observations:\n* The River \"[[Yangtze]]\" divides the empire into two halves, with 9 provinces (\"kingdoms\") south of the river and 6 to the north;\n* Marco Polo's \"Cathay\" was just south of \"[[Tartary]]\", and Ricci learned that there was no other country between the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] and \"Tartary\" (i.e., the lands of Mongols and Manchus).\n* People in China had not heard of any place called \"Cathay\".\nMost importantly, when the Jesuits first arrived to Beijing 1598, they also met a number of \"Mohammedans\" or \"Arabian Turks\" \u2013 visitors or immigrants from the Muslim countries to the west of China, who told Ricci that now they ''were'' living in the Great Cathay. This all made them quite convinced that Cathay is indeed China.<ref>Gallagher (trans.) (1953), pp. 311\u2013312. Also, in p.7, Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault|Trigault]] unambiguously state, \"the [[Saracens]], who live to the west, speak of it [China] as Cathay\".</ref>\n\n[[Jesuit China missions|China-based Jesuits]] promptly informed their colleagues in [[Goa]] (Portuguese India) and Europe about their discovery of the Cathay\u2013China identity.

Meanwhile, in China itself, people usually referred to their nation state based on the name of the ruling dynasty, e.g. ''[[Ming dynasty|Da Ming Guo]]'' (\"the kingdom of the Great Ming\"), or as the \"Middle Kingdom\" (''Zhongguo'' \u4e2d\u570b); see also [[Names of China]] for details.\n\nWhen the Portuguese reached South-East Asia ([[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquering [[Melaka|Malacca]] in 1511) and the southern coast of China ([[Jorge \u00c1lvares]] reaching the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] estuary in 1513), they started calling the country by the name used in South and South-East Asia.<ref>[[Matteo Ricci]], writing less than a century after the events, states: \"Today the people of [[Kochi, India|Cochin]] and the Siamese as well, from whom the Portuguese learned to call the empire China, call this country Cin\".  (Gallagher (1953), pp. 6\u20137)</ref> It was not immediately clear to the Europeans whether this ''China'' is the same country as ''Cathay'' known from [[Marco Polo]]. Therefore, it would not be uncommon for 16th-century maps to apply the label \"China\" just to the coastal region already well known to the Europeans (e.g., just [[Guangdong]] on [[Abraham Ortelius]]' 1570 map), and to place the mysterious Cathay somewhere inland.\n\n[[File:CEM-15-Asia-Mercator-1595-Tartaria-2532.jpg|thumb|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s placing of the \"Kingdom of Cathay\" (''Cathay Reg.'') on the Pacific Coast north-east of China remained typical for a number of maps published in the decades to follow]]\nIt was a small group of [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits]], led by [[Matteo Ricci]] who, being able both to travel throughout China and to read, learned about the country from Chinese books and from conversation with people of all walks of life. During his first 15 years in China (1583\u20131598) Matteo Ricci formed a strong suspicion that Marco Polo's \"Cathay\" is simply the \"Tatar\" (i.e., [[Mongol]]) name for the\ncountry he was in, i.e. China. Ricci supported his arguments by numerous correspondences between Marco Polo's accounts and his own observations:\n* The River \"[[Yangtze]]\" divides the empire into two halves, with 9 provinces (\"kingdoms\") south of the river and 6 to the north;\n* Marco Polo's \"Cathay\" was just south of \"[[Tartary]]\", and Ricci learned that there was no other country between the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] and \"Tartary\" (i.e., the lands of Mongols and Manchus).\n* People in China had not heard of any place called \"Cathay\".\nMost importantly, when the Jesuits first arrived to Beijing 1598, they also met a number of \"Mohammedans\" or \"Arabian Turks\" \u2013 visitors or immigrants from the Muslim countries to the west of China, who told Ricci that now they ''were'' living in the Great Cathay. This all made them quite convinced that Cathay is indeed China.<ref>Gallagher (trans.) (1953), pp. 311\u2013312. Also, in p.7, Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault|Trigault]] unambiguously state, \"the [[Saracens]], who live to the west, speak of it [China] as Cathay\".</ref>\n\n[[Jesuit China missions|China-based Jesuits]] promptly informed their colleagues in [[Goa]] (Portuguese India) and Europe about their discovery of the Cathay\u2013China identity. This was stated e.g. in a 1602 letter of Ricci's comrade [[Diego de Pantoja]], which was published in Europe along with other Jesuits' letters in 1605.<ref>Lach & Van Kley (1993), p. 1565. Pantoja's letter appeared in ''Relaci\u00f3n de la entrade de algunos padres de la Compania de Iesus en la China'' (1605)</ref> The Jesuits in India, however, were not convinced, because, according to their informants (merchants who visited the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] capitals [[Agra]] and [[Lahore]]), Cathay \u2013 a country that could be reached via [[Kashgar]] \u2013 had a large Christian population, while the Jesuits in China had not found any Christians there.<ref name=yule534>Yule, pp. 534\u2013535</ref><ref name=lach1575>Lach & Kley (1993), pp. 1575\u20131577</ref>\n\n[[File:CEM-19-Asiae-nova-description-1610-Jodocus-Hondius-2538.jpg|thumb|A typical early 17th-century depiction of \"Cataia\" as China's northeastern neighbour. [[Jodocus Hondius]], 1610]]\nIn retrospect, the Central Asian Muslim informants' idea of the Ming China being a heavily Christian country may be explained by numerous similarities between [[Buddhism and Christianity|Christian and Buddhist]] ecclesiastical rituals \u2013 from having sumptuous statuary and ecclesiastical robes to [[Gregorian chant]] \u2013 which would make the two religions appear externally similar to a Muslim merchant.<ref>Gallagher, p. 500; Yule, pp. 551\u2013552</ref> This may also have been the genesis of the [[Prester John]] myth.\n\nTo resolve the China\u2013Cathay controversy, the India Jesuits sent a Portuguese lay brother, [[Bento de G\u00f3is]] on an overland expedition north and east, with the goal of reaching Cathay and finding out once and for all whether it is China or some other country. G\u00f3is spent almost three years (1603\u20131605) crossing [[Afghanistan]], [[Badakhshan]], [[Kashgaria]], and Kingdom of [[Karasahr|Cialis]] with Muslim trade [[camel train|caravans]]. In 1605, in [[Karasahr|Cialis]], he, too, became convinced that his destination ''is'' China, as he met the members of a caravan returning from Beijing to Kashgar, who told them about staying in the same Beijing inn with Portuguese Jesuits. (In fact, those were the same very \"Saracens\" who had, a few months earlier, confirmed it to Ricci that they were in \"Cathay\"). De G\u00f3is died in [[Suzhou District|Suzhou, Gansu]] \u2013 the first [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] city he reached \u2013 while waiting for an entry permit to proceed toward Beijing; but, in the words of [[Henry Yule]],  it was his expedition that made \"''Cathay''... finally disappear from view, leaving ''China'' only in the mouths and minds of men\".<ref>[[Henry Yule]] (1866), p. 530.</ref>\n\n[[File:John-Speed-The-Kingdome-of-China-1626-2544.jpg|thumb|left|Not convinced by the Jesuits, [[John Speed]] in 1626 follows [[Jodocus Hondius]]' layout: he shows the chain of [[Silk Road]] cities visited by de G\u00f3is ([[Kuqa City|Cuchia]], [[Karasahr|Chialis]], [[Turfan]], [[Kumul, Xinjiang|Camul]]) \u2013 but has it directed not toward China's [[Shaanxi]] ''Sancii'', as shows by de G\u00f3is, but toward the mysterious \"Cathaya, the Chief Kingdome of Great [[Khan (title)|Cam]]\", northeast of China. Naturally, [[Khanbaliq|Cambalu]] and [[Shangdu|Xandu]] are shown in Cathay, while Shuntien (Beijing) is in China]]\nRicci's and de Gois' conclusion was not, however, completely convincing for everybody in Europe yet.\n[[Samuel Purchas]], who in 1625 published an English translation of Pantoja's letter and Ricci's account, thought that perhaps, Cathay still can be found somewhere north of China.<ref name=lach1575/> In this period, many cartographers were placing Cathay on the Pacific coast, north of Beijing (Pekin) which was already well-known to Europeans. The borders drawn on some of these maps would first make Cathay the northeastern section of China (e.g. [[:commons:File:CEM-15-Asia-Mercator-1595-2531.jpg|1595 map]] by [[Gerardus Mercator]]), or, later, a region separated by China by the [[Great Wall]] and possibly some mountains and/or wilderness (as in a [[:commons:File:CEM-19-Asiae-nova-description-1610-Jodocus-Hondius-2538.jpg|1610 map]] by [[Jodocus Hondius]], or a [[:commons:File:John-Speed-The-Kingdome-of-China-1626-2544.jpg|1626 map]] by [[John Speed]]).\n[[J.

Golius knew no Chinese, but he was familiar with ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]'', a work by the Persian astronomer [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], completed in 1272, in which he described the [[Chinese calendar|Chinese (\"Cathayan\") calendar]].<ref>van Dalen, Benno; Kennedy, E.S.; Saiyid, Mustafa K., \"The Chinese-Uighur Calendar in Tusi's Zij-i Ilkhani\", ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geschichte der Arabisch-Islamischen Wissenschaften'' 11 (1997) 111\u2013151</ref> Upon meeting Martini, Golius started reciting the names of the [[Earthly Branches|12 divisions]] into which, according to Nasir al-Din, the \"Cathayans\" were dividing the day \u2013 and Martini, who of course knew no Persian, was able to continue the list. The names of the 24 [[solar term]]s matched as well.

This structure is most common in smaller organizations and is best used to solve simple tasks, such as sales. The structure is totally centralized.

Precision, speed, unambiguity, \u2026 strict subordination, reduction of friction and of material and personal costs- these are raised to the optimum point in the strictly bureaucratic administration.\u201d<ref>Weber, M. (1948). From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, translated, edited and with an introduction by H. H. Gerth and C. W. Mills. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.</ref> [[Bureaucratic]] structures have a certain degree of standardization. They are better suited for more complex or larger scale organizations, usually adopting a tall structure. The tension between bureaucratic structures and non-bureaucratic is echoed in Burns and Stalker's<ref>Burns, T. and G. Stalker. (1961) The Management of Innovation. London: Tavistock.</ref> distinction between mechanistic and organic structures.\n\nThe Weberian characteristics of bureaucracy are:\n\n* Clear defined roles and responsibilities\n* A hierarchical structure\n* Respect for merit\n\nBureaucratic structures have many levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, all the way to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organizedaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A disadvantage in bureaucratic structures is that it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.\n\n===Post-bureaucratic===\nThe term of post bureaucratic is used in two senses in the organizational literature: one generic and one much more specific.<ref>Grey C., Garsten C., 2001, Trust, Control and Post-Bureaucracy, Sage Publishing)</ref> In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type [[bureaucracy]]. This may include [[total quality management]], culture management and [[matrix management]], amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies,<ref name=\"Heckscher C. 1994\">Heckscher C. (Editor), Donnellon A. (Editor), 1994, The Post-Bureaucratic Organization: New Perspectives on Organizational Change, Sage Publications</ref> rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'.\n\nAnother smaller group of theorists have developed the theory of the Post-Bureaucratic Organization.,<ref name=\"Heckscher C. 1994\" /> provide a detailed discussion which attempts to describe an organization that is fundamentally not bureaucratic. [[Charles Heckscher]] has developed an ideal type, the post-bureaucratic organization, in which decisions are based on dialogue and consensus rather than authority and command, the organization is a network rather than a hierarchy, open at the boundaries (in direct contrast to culture management); there is an emphasis on meta-decision-making rules rather than decision-making rules. This sort of horizontal decision-making by [[consensus]] model is often used in [[housing cooperatives]], other [[cooperatives]] and when running a [[non-profit]] or [[community organization]]. It is used in order to encourage [[participation (decision making)|participation]] and help to [[Empowerment|empower]] people who normally experience [[oppression]] in groups.\n\nStill other theorists are developing a resurgence of interest in [[complexity theory and organizations]], and have focused on how simple structures can be used to engender organizational adaptations. For instance, Miner ''et al.'' (2000) studied how simple structures could be used to generate improvisational outcomes in product development. Their study makes links to simple structures and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow,<ref>Nicolaj Sigglekow and Jan W. Rivkin, October 2003, Speed, Search and the Failure of Simple Contingency, No. 04-019</ref> and Nelson Repenning<ref>Repenning, N. (2002). A Simulation-Based Approach to Understanding the Dynamics of Innovation Implementation. Organization Science, 13, 2: 109-127.</ref> revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments.\n\n===Functional structure===\nA functional organizational structure is a structure that consists of activities such as coordination, supervision and task allocation. The organizational structure determines how the organization performs or operates. The term organizational structure refers to how the people in an organization are grouped and to whom they report. One traditional way of organizing people is by function. Some common functions within an organization include production, marketing, human resources, and accounting.\n\nThis organizing of specialization leads to operational efficiency, where employees become specialists within their own realm of expertise. On the other hand, the most typical problem with a functional organizational structure is that communication within the company can be rather rigid, making the organization slow and inflexible. Therefore, lateral communication between functions becomes very important, so that information is disseminated not only vertically, but also horizontally within the organization. Communication in organizations with functional organizational structures can be rigid because of the standardized ways of operation and the high degree of formalization.\n\nAs a whole, a [[functional organization]] is best suited as a producer of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a functional structure, which makes producing a limited number of products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost.<ref>Raymond E. Miles, Charles C. Snow, Causes of Failure in Network Organizations, California Management Review, Summer 1992</ref> For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them.\n\nEven though functional units often perform with a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals.\n\n===Divisional structure===\nThe divisional structure or product structure consists of self-contained divisions. A division is a collection of functions which produce a product. It also utilizes a plan to compete and operate as a separate business or profit center. According to Zainbooks.com, divisional structure in America is seen as the second most common structure for organization today.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nEmployees who are responsible for certain market services or types of products are placed in divisional structure in order to increase their flexibility. Examples of divisions include regional (a U.S Division and an EU division), consumer type (a division for companies and one for households), and product type (a division for trucks, another for SUVS, and another for cars). The divisions may also have their own departments such as marketing, sales, and engineering.\n\nThe advantage of divisional structure is that it uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Another advantage of using divisional structure is that it is more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process if they need to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar functions and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.\n\nThe disadvantages of the divisional structure is that it can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may increase costs by requiring more qualified managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than organizational goals which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel.\n\n===Matrix structure===\n{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}\nThe [[Matrix management|matrix structure]] groups employees by both function and product simultaneously.  A matrix organization frequently uses teams of employees to accomplish work, in order to take advantage of the strengths, as well as make up for the weaknesses, of functional and decentralized forms. An example would be a company that produces two products, \"product a\" and \"product b\". Using the matrix structure, this company would organize functions within the company as follows: \"product a\" sales department, \"product a\" customer service department, \"product a\" accounting, \"product b\" sales department, \"product b\" customer service department, \"product b\" accounting department.\n\n*'''Weak/functional matrix:''' A [[project manager]] with only limited authority is assigned to oversee the cross- functional aspects of the [[project]]. The functional managers maintain control over their resources and project areas.\n*'''Balanced/functional matrix:''' A project manager is assigned to oversee the project. Power is shared equally between the project manager and the [[functional manager]]s. It brings the best aspects of functional and projectized organizations. However, this is the most difficult system to maintain as the sharing of power is a delicate proposition.\n*'''Strong/project matrix:''' A [[project manager]] is primarily responsible for the project. Functional managers provide technical expertise and assign resources as needed.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of the matrix structure. Some of the disadvantages include tendencies towards [[anarchy]], [[power struggle]]s and 'sinking' to group and division levels.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last1=Davis|first1=Stanley M.|last2=Lawrence|first2=Paul R.|author-link2=Paul R.

This, in turn, can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command. An additional disadvantage of the matrix structure is higher manager to worker ratio that results in conflicting loyalties of employees. However, the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure may improve upon the \"silo\" critique of functional management in that it aims to diminish the vertical structure of functional and create a more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much quicker. It aims to allow specialization to increase depth of knowledge and allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs.\n\n===Organizational circle===\n{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}\nThe [[Flat organization|flat structure]] is common in small companies (entrepreneurial start-ups, university spin offs). As companies grow they tend to become more complex and hierarchical, which lead to an expanded structure, with more levels and departments.\n\nHowever, in rare cases, such as the examples of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], [[GitHub, Inc.]] and [[37signals]], the organization remains very flat as it grows, eschewing [[middle manager]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Why I Run a Flat Company|url = http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html|last = Fried|first = Jason|journal = [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|date=April 2011|accessdate = 1 Sep 2013}}</ref> (However, GitHub subsequently introduced middle managers.) All of the aforementioned organizations operate in the field of technology, which may be significant, as software developers are highly skilled [[professional]]s, much like [[lawyer]]s. Senior lawyers also enjoy a relatively high degree of [[autonomy]] within a typical [[law firm]], which is typically structured as a [[partnership]] rather than a hierarchical bureaucracy. Some other types of professional organizations are also commonly structured as partnerships, such as [[accountancy]] companies and [[GP surgery|GP surgeries]].\n\nOften, growth would result in [[bureaucracy]], the most prevalent structure in the past. It is still, however, relevant in former Soviet Republics, China, and most governmental organizations all over the world. [[Shell Group]] used to represent the typical bureaucracy: top-heavy and hierarchical. It featured multiple levels of command and duplicate service companies existing in different regions. All this made Shell apprehensive to market changes,<ref>Grant, R.M. (2008). History of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Available at: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/07Shell.pdf (accessed 20/10/08)</ref> leading to its incapacity to grow and develop further. The failure of this structure became the main reason for the company restructuring into a matrix.\n\n[[Starbucks]] is one of the numerous large organizations that successfully developed the matrix structure supporting their focused strategy. Its design combines functional and product based divisions, with employees reporting to two heads.<ref>(Starbucks.com (2008). Starbucks Coffee International. Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/international.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113204806/http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/international.asp |archivedate=2008-11-13 }} (accessed 20/10/08))</ref>\n\nSome experts also mention the [[multinational corporation|multinational]] design,<ref name=\"Robbins, S.F. 2007 p. 551-557\">Robbins, S.F., Judge, T.A. (2007). Organizational Behavior. 12th edition. Pearson Education Inc., p. 551-557.</ref> common in global companies, such as [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Toyota]] and [[Unilever]]. This structure can be seen as a complex form of the matrix, as it maintains coordination among products, functions and geographic areas.\n\nWith the growth of the internet, and the associated access that gives all levels of an organization to information and communication via digital means, power structures have begun to align more as a [[wirearchy]], enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.\n\nIn general, over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that through the forces of globalization, competition and more demanding customers, the structure of many companies has become flatter, less hierarchical, more fluid and even virtual.<ref>Gratton, L.

In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization.<ref name=\"Robbins, S.F. 2007 p. 551-557\" /> Teams can be both horizontal and vertical.<ref>Thareja P(2008), \"Total Quality Organization Thru\u2019 People,(Part 16), Each one is Capable\", FOUNDRY, Vol. XX, No. 4, July/Aug 2008</ref> While an organization is constituted as a set of people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams in totality.<ref>Thareja P. (2007). A Total Quality Organisation thru'People Each One is Capable. Available at: http://www.foundry-planet.com</ref> For example, every one of the [[Whole Foods Market]] stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous [[profit centre]] composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team.<ref>Fishman C. (1996). Whole Foods Is All Teams. Available at: https://www.fastcompany.com/26671/whole-foods-all-teams</ref> Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. [[Xerox]], [[Motorola]], and [[DaimlerChrysler]] are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.\n\n===Network===\nAnother modern structure is [[wikt:network|network]]. While business giants risk becoming ''too clumsy to proact (such as), act and react efficiently'',<ref>[[Evert Gummesson|Gummesson, E.]] (2002). Total Marketing Control. Butterworth-Heinemann, p. 266.</ref> the new network organizations contract out any business function, that can be done better or more cheaply. In essence, managers in network structures spend most of their time coordinating and controlling external relations, usually by electronic means. [[H&M]] is outsourcing its clothing to a network of 700 suppliers, more than two-thirds of which are based in low-cost Asian countries. Not owning any factories, H&M can be more flexible than many other retailers in lowering its costs, which aligns with its low-cost strategy.<ref>Capell, K. H&M Defies Retail Gloom.

Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the virtual organization as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist.<ref>Hedberg, B., G. Dahlgren, J. Hansson, and N.-G. Olve (1999). Virtual Organizations and Beyond: Discover Imaginary Systems. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The virtual organization exists within a network of alliances, using the Internet. This means while the core of the organization can be small but still the company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that is what made highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.<ref>Anderson, C.

Griffiths, and S. Sambrook. (2010). Organizational structure for the twenty-first century. Presented the annual meeting of The Institute for Operations Research and The Management Sciences, Austin. https://communities-innovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Organizational-Structure-for-the-Twenty-first-Century-220619i.pdf</ref>\n\nLim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) developed the Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organizational Structure borrowing from the concept of Phenotype from genetics. \"A phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism. It results from the expression of an organism\u2019s genes and the influence of the environment. The expression of an organism\u2019s genes is usually determined by pairs of alleles. Alleles are different forms of a gene. In our model, each employee\u2019s formal, hierarchical participation and informal, community participation within the organization, as influenced by his or her environment, contributes to the overall observable characteristics (phenotype) of the organization. In other words, just as all the pair of alleles within the genetic material of an organism determines the physical characteristics of the organism, the combined expressions of all the employees\u2019 formal hierarchical and informal community participation within an organization give rise to the organizational structure. Due to the vast potentially different combination of the employees\u2019 formal hierarchical and informal community participation, each organization is therefore a unique phenotype along a spectrum between a pure hierarchy and a pure community (flat) organizational structure.\"<ref name=\"Lim et al., (2010)\" />\n\n\"The Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organisational Structure views an organisation as having both a hierarchy and a community structure, both equally well established and occurring extensively throughout the organisation. On the practical level, it utilises the organizational chart to study the hierarchical structure which brings across individuals\u2019 roles and formal authority within their designated space at the workplace, and social network analysis to map out the community structure within the organisation, identifying individuals\u2019 informal influences which usually do not respect workplace boundaries and at many times extend beyond the workplace.\"<ref name=\"Lim (2017)\" />\n\n==History==\nOrganizational structures developed from the ancient times of hunters and collectors in tribal organizations through highly royal and clerical [[power structure]]s to industrial structures and today's [[post-industrial]] structures.\n\nAs pointed out by Lawrence B. Mohr,<ref>Mohr, L. B. (1982). ''Explaining Organizational Behavior''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.</ref> the early theorists of organizational structure, Taylor, Fayol, and Weber \"saw the importance of structure for effectiveness and efficiency and assumed without the slightest question that whatever structure was needed, people could fashion accordingly. Organizational structure was considered a matter of choice... When in the 1930s, the rebellion began that came to be known as human relations theory, there was still not a denial of the idea of structure as an artifact, but rather an advocacy of the creation of a different sort of structure, one in which the needs, knowledge, and opinions of employees might be given greater recognition.\" However, a different view arose in the 1960s, suggesting that the organizational structure is \"an externally caused phenomenon, an outcome rather than an artifact.\"<ref>Mohr, L. B. (1982). Explaining Organizational Behavior. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, organizational theorists such as Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) are once again proposing that organizational structure development is very much dependent on the expression of the strategies and behavior of the management and the workers as constrained by the power distribution between them, and influenced by their environment and the outcome.<ref name=\"Lim et al., (2010)\" />\n\n==Military Command and Control==\nThere are correspondences between Mintzberg's organizational archetypes and various approaches to military [[Command and Control]] (C2).  Mintzberg's Machine Bureaucracy represents a highly centralized approach to C2, with a narrow allocation of decision rights, restricted patterns of interaction among organization members, and a restricted flow of information.  Mintzberg's Adhocracy, on the other hand, represents a more networked and less centralized approach to C2, with more individual initiative and self-synchronization.  It involves a broader allocation of decision rights, broader interaction patterns, and broader information distribution.  Mintzberg's other organization types (for example, the Professional Bureaucracy and the Simple Structure) fall in between these two.<ref>Vassiliou, Marius, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre (2015). \"C2 Re-Envisioned: the Future of the Enterprise.\" CRC Press; New York; pp. 93-96.</ref>\n\n==Operational and informal==\n{{See also|Informal organization|Formal organization}}\nThe set organizational structure may not coincide with facts, evolving in operational action.

Precision, speed, unambiguity, \u2026 strict subordination, reduction of friction and of material and personal costs- these are raised to the optimum point in the strictly bureaucratic administration.\u201d<ref>Weber, M. (1948). From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, translated, edited and with an introduction by H. H. Gerth and C. W. Mills. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.</ref> [[Bureaucratic]] structures have a certain degree of standardization. They are better suited for more complex or larger scale organizations, usually adopting a tall structure. The tension between bureaucratic structures and non-bureaucratic is echoed in Burns and Stalker's<ref>Burns, T. and G. Stalker. (1961) The Management of Innovation. London: Tavistock.</ref> distinction between mechanistic and organic structures.\n\nThe Weberian characteristics of bureaucracy are:\n\n* Clear defined roles and responsibilities\n* A hierarchical structure\n* Respect for merit\n\nBureaucratic structures have many levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, all the way to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organizedaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A disadvantage in bureaucratic structures is that it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.\n\n===Post-bureaucratic===\nThe term of post bureaucratic is used in two senses in the organizational literature: one generic and one much more specific.<ref>Grey C., Garsten C., 2001, Trust, Control and Post-Bureaucracy, Sage Publishing)</ref> In the generic sense the term post bureaucratic is often used to describe a range of ideas developed since the 1980s that specifically contrast themselves with Weber's ideal type [[bureaucracy]]. This may include [[total quality management]], culture management and [[matrix management]], amongst others. None of these however has left behind the core tenets of Bureaucracy. Hierarchies still exist, authority is still Weber's rational, legal type, and the organization is still rule bound. Heckscher, arguing along these lines, describes them as cleaned up bureaucracies,<ref name=\"Heckscher C. 1994\">Heckscher C. (Editor), Donnellon A. (Editor), 1994, The Post-Bureaucratic Organization: New Perspectives on Organizational Change, Sage Publications</ref> rather than a fundamental shift away from bureaucracy. Gideon Kunda, in his classic study of culture management at 'Tech' argued that 'the essence of bureaucratic control - the formalization, codification and enforcement of rules and regulations - does not change in principle.....it shifts focus from organizational structure to the organization's culture'.\n\nAnother smaller group of theorists have developed the theory of the Post-Bureaucratic Organization.,<ref name=\"Heckscher C. 1994\" /> provide a detailed discussion which attempts to describe an organization that is fundamentally not bureaucratic. [[Charles Heckscher]] has developed an ideal type, the post-bureaucratic organization, in which decisions are based on dialogue and consensus rather than authority and command, the organization is a network rather than a hierarchy, open at the boundaries (in direct contrast to culture management); there is an emphasis on meta-decision-making rules rather than decision-making rules. This sort of horizontal decision-making by [[consensus]] model is often used in [[housing cooperatives]], other [[cooperatives]] and when running a [[non-profit]] or [[community organization]]. It is used in order to encourage [[participation (decision making)|participation]] and help to [[Empowerment|empower]] people who normally experience [[oppression]] in groups.\n\nStill other theorists are developing a resurgence of interest in [[complexity theory and organizations]], and have focused on how simple structures can be used to engender organizational adaptations. For instance, Miner ''et al.'' (2000) studied how simple structures could be used to generate improvisational outcomes in product development. Their study makes links to simple structures and improviser learning. Other scholars such as Jan Rivkin and Sigglekow,<ref>Nicolaj Sigglekow and Jan W. Rivkin, October 2003, Speed, Search and the Failure of Simple Contingency, No. 04-019</ref> and Nelson Repenning<ref>Repenning, N. (2002). A Simulation-Based Approach to Understanding the Dynamics of Innovation Implementation. Organization Science, 13, 2: 109-127.</ref> revive an older interest in how structure and strategy relate in dynamic environments.\n\n===Functional structure===\nA functional organizational structure is a structure that consists of activities such as coordination, supervision and task allocation. The organizational structure determines how the organization performs or operates. The term organizational structure refers to how the people in an organization are grouped and to whom they report. One traditional way of organizing people is by function. Some common functions within an organization include production, marketing, human resources, and accounting.\n\nThis organizing of specialization leads to operational efficiency, where employees become specialists within their own realm of expertise. On the other hand, the most typical problem with a functional organizational structure is that communication within the company can be rather rigid, making the organization slow and inflexible. Therefore, lateral communication between functions becomes very important, so that information is disseminated not only vertically, but also horizontally within the organization. Communication in organizations with functional organizational structures can be rigid because of the standardized ways of operation and the high degree of formalization.\n\nAs a whole, a [[functional organization]] is best suited as a producer of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in a functional structure, which makes producing a limited number of products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost.<ref>Raymond E. Miles, Charles C. Snow, Causes of Failure in Network Organizations, California Management Review, Summer 1992</ref> For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them.\n\nEven though functional units often perform with a high level of efficiency, their level of cooperation with each other is sometimes compromised. Such groups may have difficulty working well with each other as they may be territorial and unwilling to cooperate. The occurrence of infighting among units may cause delays, reduced commitment due to competing interests, and wasted time, making projects fall behind schedule. This ultimately can bring down production levels overall, and the company-wide employee commitment toward meeting organizational goals.\n\n===Divisional structure===\nThe divisional structure or product structure consists of self-contained divisions. A division is a collection of functions which produce a product. It also utilizes a plan to compete and operate as a separate business or profit center. According to Zainbooks.com, divisional structure in America is seen as the second most common structure for organization today.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nEmployees who are responsible for certain market services or types of products are placed in divisional structure in order to increase their flexibility. Examples of divisions include regional (a U.S Division and an EU division), consumer type (a division for companies and one for households), and product type (a division for trucks, another for SUVS, and another for cars). The divisions may also have their own departments such as marketing, sales, and engineering.\n\nThe advantage of divisional structure is that it uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Another advantage of using divisional structure is that it is more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process if they need to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar functions and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.\n\nThe disadvantages of the divisional structure is that it can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may increase costs by requiring more qualified managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than organizational goals which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel.\n\n===Matrix structure===\n{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}\nThe [[Matrix management|matrix structure]] groups employees by both function and product simultaneously.  A matrix organization frequently uses teams of employees to accomplish work, in order to take advantage of the strengths, as well as make up for the weaknesses, of functional and decentralized forms. An example would be a company that produces two products, \"product a\" and \"product b\". Using the matrix structure, this company would organize functions within the company as follows: \"product a\" sales department, \"product a\" customer service department, \"product a\" accounting, \"product b\" sales department, \"product b\" customer service department, \"product b\" accounting department.\n\n*'''Weak/functional matrix:''' A [[project manager]] with only limited authority is assigned to oversee the cross- functional aspects of the [[project]]. The functional managers maintain control over their resources and project areas.\n*'''Balanced/functional matrix:''' A project manager is assigned to oversee the project. Power is shared equally between the project manager and the [[functional manager]]s. It brings the best aspects of functional and projectized organizations. However, this is the most difficult system to maintain as the sharing of power is a delicate proposition.\n*'''Strong/project matrix:''' A [[project manager]] is primarily responsible for the project. Functional managers provide technical expertise and assign resources as needed.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages of the matrix structure. Some of the disadvantages include tendencies towards [[anarchy]], [[power struggle]]s and 'sinking' to group and division levels.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last1=Davis|first1=Stanley M.|last2=Lawrence|first2=Paul R.|author-link2=Paul R.

This, in turn, can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command. An additional disadvantage of the matrix structure is higher manager to worker ratio that results in conflicting loyalties of employees. However, the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure may improve upon the \"silo\" critique of functional management in that it aims to diminish the vertical structure of functional and create a more horizontal structure which allows the spread of information across task boundaries to happen much quicker. It aims to allow specialization to increase depth of knowledge and allows individuals to be chosen according to project needs.\n\n===Organizational circle===\n{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}\nThe [[Flat organization|flat structure]] is common in small companies (entrepreneurial start-ups, university spin offs). As companies grow they tend to become more complex and hierarchical, which lead to an expanded structure, with more levels and departments.\n\nHowever, in rare cases, such as the examples of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], [[GitHub, Inc.]] and [[37signals]], the organization remains very flat as it grows, eschewing [[middle manager]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Why I Run a Flat Company|url = http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html|last = Fried|first = Jason|journal = [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|date=April 2011|accessdate = 1 Sep 2013}}</ref> (However, GitHub subsequently introduced middle managers.) All of the aforementioned organizations operate in the field of technology, which may be significant, as software developers are highly skilled [[professional]]s, much like [[lawyer]]s. Senior lawyers also enjoy a relatively high degree of [[autonomy]] within a typical [[law firm]], which is typically structured as a [[partnership]] rather than a hierarchical bureaucracy. Some other types of professional organizations are also commonly structured as partnerships, such as [[accountancy]] companies and [[GP surgery|GP surgeries]].\n\nOften, growth would result in [[bureaucracy]], the most prevalent structure in the past. It is still, however, relevant in former Soviet Republics, China, and most governmental organizations all over the world. [[Shell Group]] used to represent the typical bureaucracy: top-heavy and hierarchical. It featured multiple levels of command and duplicate service companies existing in different regions. All this made Shell apprehensive to market changes,<ref>Grant, R.M. (2008). History of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Available at: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/grant/docs/07Shell.pdf (accessed 20/10/08)</ref> leading to its incapacity to grow and develop further. The failure of this structure became the main reason for the company restructuring into a matrix.\n\n[[Starbucks]] is one of the numerous large organizations that successfully developed the matrix structure supporting their focused strategy. Its design combines functional and product based divisions, with employees reporting to two heads.<ref>(Starbucks.com (2008). Starbucks Coffee International. Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/international.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113204806/http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/international.asp |archivedate=2008-11-13 }} (accessed 20/10/08))</ref>\n\nSome experts also mention the [[multinational corporation|multinational]] design,<ref name=\"Robbins, S.F. 2007 p. 551-557\">Robbins, S.F., Judge, T.A. (2007). Organizational Behavior. 12th edition. Pearson Education Inc., p. 551-557.</ref> common in global companies, such as [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Toyota]] and [[Unilever]]. This structure can be seen as a complex form of the matrix, as it maintains coordination among products, functions and geographic areas.\n\nWith the growth of the internet, and the associated access that gives all levels of an organization to information and communication via digital means, power structures have begun to align more as a [[wirearchy]], enabling the flow of power and authority to be based not on hierarchical levels, but on information, trust, credibility, and a focus on results.\n\nIn general, over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that through the forces of globalization, competition and more demanding customers, the structure of many companies has become flatter, less hierarchical, more fluid and even virtual.<ref>Gratton, L. (2004). The Democratic Enterprise, Financial Times Prentice Hall, pp. xii-xiv.</ref>\n\n===Team===\nOne of the newest organizational structures developed in the 20th century is ''[[team]]'' and the related concept of team development or [[team building]]. In small businesses, the team structure can define the entire organization.<ref name=\"Robbins, S.F. 2007 p. 551-557\" /> Teams can be both horizontal and vertical.<ref>Thareja P(2008), \"Total Quality Organization Thru\u2019 People,(Part 16), Each one is Capable\", FOUNDRY, Vol. XX, No. 4, July/Aug 2008</ref> While an organization is constituted as a set of people who synergize individual competencies to achieve newer dimensions, the quality of organizational structure revolves around the competencies of teams in totality.<ref>Thareja P. (2007). A Total Quality Organisation thru'People Each One is Capable. Available at: http://www.foundry-planet.com</ref> For example, every one of the [[Whole Foods Market]] stores, the largest natural-foods grocer in the US developing a focused strategy, is an autonomous [[profit centre]] composed of an average of 10 self-managed teams, while team leaders in each store and each region are also a team.<ref>Fishman C. (1996). Whole Foods Is All Teams. Available at: https://www.fastcompany.com/26671/whole-foods-all-teams</ref> Larger bureaucratic organizations can benefit from the flexibility of teams as well. [[Xerox]], [[Motorola]], and [[DaimlerChrysler]] are all among the companies that actively use teams to perform tasks.\n\n===Network===\nAnother modern structure is [[wikt:network|network]]. While business giants risk becoming ''too clumsy to proact (such as), act and react efficiently'',<ref>[[Evert Gummesson|Gummesson, E.]] (2002). Total Marketing Control. Butterworth-Heinemann, p. 266.</ref> the new network organizations contract out any business function, that can be done better or more cheaply. In essence, managers in network structures spend most of their time coordinating and controlling external relations, usually by electronic means. [[H&M]] is outsourcing its clothing to a network of 700 suppliers, more than two-thirds of which are based in low-cost Asian countries. Not owning any factories, H&M can be more flexible than many other retailers in lowering its costs, which aligns with its low-cost strategy.<ref>Capell, K. H&M Defies Retail Gloom.

Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the virtual organization as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist.<ref>Hedberg, B., G. Dahlgren, J. Hansson, and N.-G. Olve (1999). Virtual Organizations and Beyond: Discover Imaginary Systems. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The virtual organization exists within a network of alliances, using the Internet. This means while the core of the organization can be small but still the company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that is what made highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.<ref>Anderson, C.

(1986). A global view of informal organization. Academy of Management Journal, 51, 3, 39-43.</ref>\n\nThe business is no longer just a place where people come to work. For most of the employees, the firm confers on them that sense of belonging and identity \u2013\u2013 the firm has become their \u201cvillage\u201d, their community.<ref>Stacey, M. (1974). The myth of community studies. C. Bell, H. Newby, (Editors), The Sociology of Community: A Selection of Readings. London, Frank Cass, 13-26.\n</ref> The firm of the 21st century is not just a hierarchy which ensures maximum efficiency and profit; it is also the community where people belong to and grow together, where their affective and innovative needs are met.<ref name=\"Lim et al., (2010)\">Lim, M., G. Griffiths, and S. Sambrook. (2010). Organizational structure for the twenty-first century. Presented the annual meeting of The Institute for Operations Research and The Management Sciences, Austin. https://communities-innovation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Organizational-Structure-for-the-Twenty-first-Century-220619i.pdf</ref>\n\nLim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) developed the Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organizational Structure borrowing from the concept of Phenotype from genetics. \"A phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism. It results from the expression of an organism\u2019s genes and the influence of the environment. The expression of an organism\u2019s genes is usually determined by pairs of alleles. Alleles are different forms of a gene. In our model, each employee\u2019s formal, hierarchical participation and informal, community participation within the organization, as influenced by his or her environment, contributes to the overall observable characteristics (phenotype) of the organization. In other words, just as all the pair of alleles within the genetic material of an organism determines the physical characteristics of the organism, the combined expressions of all the employees\u2019 formal hierarchical and informal community participation within an organization give rise to the organizational structure. Due to the vast potentially different combination of the employees\u2019 formal hierarchical and informal community participation, each organization is therefore a unique phenotype along a spectrum between a pure hierarchy and a pure community (flat) organizational structure.\"<ref name=\"Lim et al., (2010)\" />\n\n\"The Hierarchy-Community Phenotype Model of Organisational Structure views an organisation as having both a hierarchy and a community structure, both equally well established and occurring extensively throughout the organisation. On the practical level, it utilises the organizational chart to study the hierarchical structure which brings across individuals\u2019 roles and formal authority within their designated space at the workplace, and social network analysis to map out the community structure within the organisation, identifying individuals\u2019 informal influences which usually do not respect workplace boundaries and at many times extend beyond the workplace.\"<ref name=\"Lim (2017)\" />\n\n==History==\nOrganizational structures developed from the ancient times of hunters and collectors in tribal organizations through highly royal and clerical [[power structure]]s to industrial structures and today's [[post-industrial]] structures.\n\nAs pointed out by Lawrence B. Mohr,<ref>Mohr, L. B. (1982). ''Explaining Organizational Behavior''. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.</ref> the early theorists of organizational structure, Taylor, Fayol, and Weber \"saw the importance of structure for effectiveness and efficiency and assumed without the slightest question that whatever structure was needed, people could fashion accordingly. Organizational structure was considered a matter of choice... When in the 1930s, the rebellion began that came to be known as human relations theory, there was still not a denial of the idea of structure as an artifact, but rather an advocacy of the creation of a different sort of structure, one in which the needs, knowledge, and opinions of employees might be given greater recognition.\" However, a different view arose in the 1960s, suggesting that the organizational structure is \"an externally caused phenomenon, an outcome rather than an artifact.\"<ref>Mohr, L. B. (1982). Explaining Organizational Behavior. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, organizational theorists such as Lim, Griffiths, and Sambrook (2010) are once again proposing that organizational structure development is very much dependent on the expression of the strategies and behavior of the management and the workers as constrained by the power distribution between them, and influenced by their environment and the outcome.<ref name=\"Lim et al., (2010)\" />\n\n==Military Command and Control==\nThere are correspondences between Mintzberg's organizational archetypes and various approaches to military [[Command and Control]] (C2).  Mintzberg's Machine Bureaucracy represents a highly centralized approach to C2, with a narrow allocation of decision rights, restricted patterns of interaction among organization members, and a restricted flow of information.  Mintzberg's Adhocracy, on the other hand, represents a more networked and less centralized approach to C2, with more individual initiative and self-synchronization.  It involves a broader allocation of decision rights, broader interaction patterns, and broader information distribution.  Mintzberg's other organization types (for example, the Professional Bureaucracy and the Simple Structure) fall in between these two.<ref>Vassiliou, Marius, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre (2015). \"C2 Re-Envisioned: the Future of the Enterprise.\" CRC Press; New York; pp. 93-96.</ref>\n\n==Operational and informal==\n{{See also|Informal organization|Formal organization}}\nThe set organizational structure may not coincide with facts, evolving in operational action. Such divergence decreases performance, when growing as a wrong organizational structure may hamper cooperation and thus hinder the completion of orders in due time and within limits of resources and budgets.\n\nOrganizational structures should be adaptive to process requirements, aiming to optimize the ratio of effort and input to output.\n\n== Configurations of organizational structure according to Mintzberg ==\n\n=== Parts of organization ===\n[[Image:Technostructure.svg|thumb|Diagram, proposed by [[Henry Mintzberg]], showing the main parts of organisation, including technostructure]]\n[[Henry Mintzberg]] considers five main parts of organization:<ref name=\"Jucevi\u010dius_1998_81-92psl\">[[Robertas Jucevi\u010dius]] \"Strateginis organizacij\u0173 vystymas\", \u201ePasaulio lietuvi\u0173 kult\u016bros, mokslo ir \u0161vietimo centras\u201c, 1998, {{ISBN|9986-418-07-0}}, p. 81-92</ref>\n\n* [[Strategic apex]] (leaders of organization)\n* [[Middle line]] (managers of lower level)\n* [[Operating core]] (workers of lowest level, directly producing something or providing services)\n* [[Technostructure]] (analysts)\n* [[Support staff]] (helping other members of organisation to perform their function)\n\nAn additional element is [[organisational ideology]].<ref name=\"Jucevi\u010dius_1998_81-92psl\"/>\n\n=== Mechanisms of coordination ===\n\nMintzberg considers six main mechanisms of coordination of work:<ref name=\"Jucevi\u010dius_1998_81-92psl\"/>\n\n* Mutual adjustment (without formal, standardized mechanisms)\n* Direct supervision (when one person, leader of organization, gives direct orders to others)\n* Standardization of work processes (based on the documents that regulate work and are produced by technostructure)\n* Standardization of outputs (only the results of work are regulated)\n* Standardization of skills (based on preparing the specialists outside the organization)\n* Standardization of norms (based on organisation's values, ideology)\n\n=== Configurations of organizations ===\n\nMintzberg considers seven main configurations of organizational structure:<ref name=\"Jucevi\u010dius_1998_81-92psl\"/>\n\n# Entrepreneurial organization (strategic apex, direct supervision dominate)\n# Machine organization (technostructure, standardization of work processes dominate)\n# Professional organization (operating core, standardization of skills dominate)\n# Diversified organization (middle level, standardization of outputs dominate)\n# Innovative organization (support staff, mutual adjustment dominate)\n# Missionary organization (ideology, standardization of norms dominate)\n# Political organization (no part or mechanism of coordination dominates)\n\nEntrepreneurial organisation or Simple structure has simple, informal structure.<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\">Victoria Lemieux \"Applying Mintzberg's Theories on Organizational Configuration to Archival Appraisal\" // \"Archivaria\", 1998, 46, p. 32-85 [https://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/view/12675/13842]</ref> Its leader coordinates the work using direct supervision.<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/> There is no technostructure, little support staff.<ref name=\"Lunenburg_2012\"/> Such structure is usually found in organizations with environment that is simple (so that one man could have significant influence), but changing (so that flexibility of one man would give a significant advantage over the bureaucratic structures).<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/>\n\nMachine organisation or Machine bureaucracy has formal rules regulating the work, developed technostructure and middle line, is centralised, hierarchical.<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/> Such structure is common when the work is simple and repetitive.<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/> Organizations also tend to achieve such structure when they are strongly controlled from outside.<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/> Also, such structure is common for organizations that perform work that is related to some sort of control (for example, [[prison]]s, [[police]]), or organizations with special safety requirements (for example, [[fire department]]s, [[airline]]s).<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/>\n\nProfessional configuration or Professional bureaucracy mostly coordinates the work of members of operating core, professionals, through their training (for example, in [[university]]).<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/> Operating core in such organisation is large, middle line insignificant, as the professionals perform complex work and have significant autonomy.<ref name=\"Lemieux_1998\"/> Technostructure is also insignificant.<ref name=\"Lunenburg_2012\">Fred C.
