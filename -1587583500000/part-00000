Its course passes through the [[States of Germany|federal states]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (23.0&nbsp;km), [[Hesse]] (165.6&nbsp;km), and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (57.0&nbsp;km).\n\nIt has its source in the [[Rothaar Mountains|Rothaargebirge]], the highest part of the [[Sauerland]]. It meets the [[Rhine]] at [[Lahnstein]], near [[Koblenz]]. Important cities along the Lahn include [[Marburg]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], [[Limburg an der Lahn]], [[Weilburg]] and [[Bad Ems]].\n\nTributaries to the Lahn include the [[Ohm (river)|Ohm]], [[Dill (river)|Dill]], the [[Weil (river)|Weil]] and the [[Aar (Lahn)|Aar]]. The lower Lahn has many [[dams]] with [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], allowing regular shipping from its [[mouth (river)|mouth]] up to [[Runkel]]. Riverboats also operate on a small section north of the dam in Gie\u00dfen.\n\n==Source area==\n[[File:Lahnquelle Lahnhof.jpg|thumb|Source of the Lahn at the Lahnhof]]The Lahn is a {{convert|245.6|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}-long, right (or eastern) [[tributary]] of the [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]]. Its course passes through the [[States of Germany|federal states]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (23.0&nbsp;km), [[Hesse]] (165.6&nbsp;km), and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (57.0&nbsp;km).\n\nThe Lahn originates at the Lahnhof, a locality of Nenkersdorf, which is a constituent community of [[Netphen]] in southeastern North Rhine-Westphalia, near the border with Hesse. The source area is situated along the Eisenstra\u00dfe scenic highway and the [[Rothaarsteig]] hiking trail.\n\nThe river arises in the southeastern Rothaargebirge in the Ederkopf-Lahnkopf-R\u00fccken ridge-line natural area. This ridge is the [[drainage divide]] between the Rhine and [[Weser]], and, within the Rhine system, the watershed between the rivers Lahn and [[Sieg]].\n\nThe source is at an elevation of {{convert|600|m|ft|sp=us}} and is located southwest of the {{convert|624|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Lahnkopf. In the vicinity are also the origins of the [[Eder]] (5.5&nbsp;km northwest of the Lahnhof) and the Sieg (another 3&nbsp;km north). Whereas the Sieg takes the shortest route to the Rhine (to the west), the Lahn first runs in the opposite direction, paralleling the Eder for many kilometers.\n\n==Course==\nThe Lahn first flows in a northeasterly direction through the southeastern Rothaargebirge and its foothills. From about the [[Bad Laasphe]] community of Feudingen, it turns primarily to the east.\n\n===Upper Lahntal and Wetschaft Depression===\n[[File:Lahn Wetschaft.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The confluence of the Wetschaft with the Lahn]][[File:Laasphe De Merian Hassiae 144.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Upper Lahn Valley at Bad Laasphe from the ''Topographia Hassiae'' of Matth\u00e4us Merian, 1655]]The section of the Lahn below the town of Bad Laasphe is geographically known as the Upper Lahn Valley ([[German language|German]]: Ober Lahntal). Above Bad Laasphe, where the river flows between the Rothaargebirge on the left (i.e. to the north) and the [[Gladenbach Uplands]] on the right, the Lahn Valley is simply considered part of these mountains.\n\nBetween Niederlaasphe (of Bad Laasphe) and Wallau (of [[Biedenkopf]]), the river crosses the border between North-Rhine Westphalia and Hesse. It then flows in an easterly direction through some districts of Biedenkopf (but not the central town) and the towns of [[Dautphetal]] and [[Lahntal]]. It is joined from the right by the [[Perf (Lahn)|Perf]] at Wallau and at Friedensdorf (of Dautphetal) by the [[Dautphe]] (which flows in a side valley to the south).\n\nShortly after the village of Caldern (of Lahn Valley), the ridgeline of the Rothaargebirge on the north ends with the Wollenberg and that of the Gladenbach Bergland with the Hungert. The Lahn leaves the [[Rhenish Slate Mountains]] for a long section and reaches the [[West Hesse Highlands]], where it flows through the extreme south of the [[Wetschaft Depression]], north of the Marburger R\u00fccken. Where the [[Wetschaft]] flows into it from the Burgwald forest in the north (near the Lahntal village of G\u00f6ttingen), the Lahn immediately changes direction by 90\u00b0 to the right.\n\n=== Marburg-Gie\u00dfen Lahntal ===\nThe now southward-flowing Lahn then enters the Marburg-Gie\u00dfen Lahntal. Shortly before [[C\u00f6lbe]], the [[Ohm (river)|Ohm]] enters from the left at the ''Lahn-Knie'' named area. Flowing from the [[Vogelsberg]] through the ''Ohmtal'', the Ohm is the Lahn's longest tributary, with a length of {{convert|59.7|km|mi}}.\n\nThe river then breaks through a [[sandstone]] [[mesa]] (the Marburger R\u00fccken to the west and the Lahnberge to the east) into a valley which encompasses the entire territory of the city of [[Marburg]] and its suburbs. The valley begins after the river passes the Marburger R\u00fccken near [[Weimar (Lahn)|Niederweimar]], where the [[Allna]] enters from the right. At the valley's southern end, the [[Zwesten Ohm]] enters from the Lahnberge. The right (western) side of the valley is again formed by the Gladenbacher Bergland, from which the [[Salzb\u00f6de]] enters the Lahn. On the left rises the Lumda Plateau, from which the eponymous river [[Lumda (river)|Lumda]] flows into the Lahn near [[Lollar]]. Gradually the valley widens into the [[Gie\u00dfen Basin]].\n\n[[File:Heuchelheimer See.jpg|thumb|Heuchelheim Lake]]In [[Gie\u00dfen]], after the inflow of the [[Wieseck (river)|Wieseck]] from the left, the Lahn's general direction of flow changes from the south to the west. The Gie\u00dfen Basin extends a few more miles downstream to Atzbach, a suburb of [[Lahnau]]. From the 1960s until the 1980s, there was extensive [[gravel]] mining in this area. The area between [[Heuchelheim]], Lahnau, and the [[Wetzlar]] borough of Dutenhofen was to be completely mined and a water sports center with an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-suitable [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] course built. This plan was partly realized, and the Heuchelheim Lake and Dutenhofen Lake are now popular recreational destinations for the surrounding region. Nature conservation organizations, however, were able to prevent further gravel mining, so the area is now one of the largest [[nature reserves]] in Hesse. Dutenhofen Lake marks Kilometer 0 of the Lahn as a federal waterway.\n\nThe Gie\u00dfen Basin is surrounded by the mountain peaks of the Gleiberg, the Vetzberg, the D\u00fcnsberg, and the Schiffenberg.  At Wetzlar, the Lahn is joined by its second longest tributary, the [[Dill (river)|Dill]], which has a length of {{convert|55.0|km|mi}}. At this location, the valleys of the Lahn and Dill separate three parts of the Rhenish Slate Mountains from each other: the Gladenbach Bergland, the [[Westerwald]] to the northwest, and the [[Taunus]] to the south.\n\n===Weilburg Lahntal===\n[[File:Lahntunnel Weilburg.JPG|thumb|Weilburg boat tunnel]]After Wetzlar, the valley of the Lahn gradually narrows and at Leun enters the Weilburger Lahntal. The Weilburger Lahntal belongs to the larger Gie\u00dfen-Koblenzer Lahntal physiographic province, considered part of the Rhenish Slate Mountains.\n\nIn the upper area of the Weilburg Lahntal (the L\u00f6hnberg Basin) are [[mineral springs]], such as the famous [[Selters (Lahn)|Selters]] mineral spring in the municipality of [[L\u00f6hnberg]]. In the lower area, where the river turns again to the south, the Lahn is entrenched canyon-like below the level of the surrounding geographic trough.\n\nThe city of [[Weilburg]] is wrapped by a marked loop of the river. The neck of this noose is traversed by a boat tunnel, unique in Germany. A little below Weilburg, the [[Weil (river)|Weil]], originating in the High Taunus, enters the Lahn.\n\n===Limburger Basin===\nAt Aumenau in the municipality of [[Villmar]], the course of the Lahn reverses to the west again and enters the fertile Limburger Basin, where the river is incised to a depth of about {{convert|50|m|ft}}. Here the river is joined by two tributaries, the [[Emsbach]] coming from the Taunus and the [[Elbbach (Lahn)|Elbbach]] from the Westerwald. In this area are frequent outcroppings of [[Devonian]] [[limestone]], the so-called Lahn Marble (German: ''Lahnmarmor''), such as at [[Limburg an der Lahn]], where the [[Limburg Cathedral]] crowns such an outcropping. At Limburg, the river again enters a wider valley.\n\n===Lower Lahntal===\nBelow [[Diez, Germany|Diez]], the Lahn absorbs the [[Aar (Lahn)|Aar]] from the south. At Fachingen in the municipality of [[Birlenbach]], it leaves the Limburger Basin and enters the Lower Lahntal.  Its course is incised over {{convert|200|m|ft}} deep in the Slate Mountains. Near [[Obernhof]], the [[Gelbach]] enters the Lahn opposite [[Arnstein Abbey]]. Then, after passing [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]] and [[Bad Ems]], where, as in Fachingen, mineral springs (sources of Emser salt) can be found, it completes its {{convert|242|km|mi|abbr=on}} run, entering the Rhine in [[Lahnstein]], located five kilometers south of [[Koblenz]] at an elevation of {{convert|61|m|ft}}.\n\n[[File:Lahnmundung.jpg|thumb|center|Confluence of the Lahn with the Rhine near Niederlahnstein (opposite [[Koblenz]]-Stolzenfels with Schloss Stolzenfels)|950px]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe Lahn area was settled as early as in the [[Stone Age]], as shown by [[archeological]] finds near Diez, in Steeden in the community of [[Runkel]], and in Wetzlar. Recent discoveries in Dalheim on the western edge of Wetzlar show a ca. 7000-year-old [[Linear Pottery culture]] settlement. There are also remains a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlement in the location, dated to around the 1st century, situated above a bend of the Lahn.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Era, the Lahn presumably was used by the Romans to supply their fort at Bad Ems, Kastell Ems. Here the ''[[Limes Germanicus]]'' on the borders of [[Germania Superior]] and [[Rhaetia]] crossed the Lahn. Archaeological finds are known from Niederlahnstein, as well as from Lahnau. One Lahnau site, the [[Waldgirmes Forum]] in the community of Waldgirmes, was discovered in the 1990s and had been the site of a Roman town. Another site in the community of Dorlar has the remains of a Roman marching camp (or ''[[castra]]''). These Lahnau sites have significant altered the current understanding of the history of the Romans east of the Rhine and north of the ''Limes''.\n\nDuring the [[Migration Period]], the [[Alamanni]] settled in the lower Lahntal. They were later ousted by the [[Franks]].\n\nThe origin and meaning of the name Lahn are uncertain; it is possible that it is a pre-Germanic word. The form of the name changed over time; before 600, variations like Laugona, Logana, Logene or Loyn are typical. The oldest known use of the current spelling of the name dates to 1365.\n\nThe oldest mention of the [[staple right]] of Diez dates to the early 14th century and is an indication of significant shipping on the Lahn by that time. In 1559, [[John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg|John VI]] of [[Nassau-Dillenburg]] laid out a [[towpath]] on the lower Lahn. In 1606, for the first time, the Lahn was deepened to allow small scale shipping and the lower reaches became navigable for four to five months of the year. However, there were numerous [[weir]]s with only narrow gaps, so the traffic remained restricted to small boats.\n\nIn the 17th and early 18th centuries, there were several initiatives of adjacent princes to further expand the Lahn as a waterway, but they all failed due to lack of coordination. In 1740, the [[Archbishopric of Trier]] began construction to make the mouth of the Lahn passable for larger vessels. In winter of 1753/54, bank stabilization and creation of towpaths were done along the entire length of the river. Then the river was passable for vessels with up to 240 [[hundredweight]]s of cargo downstream and up to 160 hundredweights upstream.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, over 300 castles, fortresses, fortified churches, and similar buildings were built along the river.\n\n===Shipping during the Industrial Revolution===\nDuring the [[First French Empire|French occupation]], inspections of the river began in 1796, which were to be followed by a comprehensive expansion. Due to political developments, however, this expansion did not take place. The newly created [[Duchy of Nassau]] eventually began work from 1808 under the Chief Construction Inspector of [[Kirn]] to make the Lahn fully navigable. In the first winter, the section of the riverside from the mouth to Limburg was stabilized, particularly so that the course could be narrowed in shallow places. It was planned in the long run to make the Lahn navigable as far as Marburg and from there to construct a [[canal]] to [[Fulda]] to connect it with the [[Weser]]. This would create a waterway from France to [[North Sea]] via the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Upstream of Limburg, however, the work was slow, partly because the population pressed into emergency service only reluctantly cooperated. Large parts of the shore were only secured with [[fascine]]s, which rotted shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1816 the Duchy of Nassau and the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] agreed to expand the Lahn as far as Giessen, where it joined the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. Little is known about the work that followed, but in the 1825 boatmen on the Lahn who shipped mineral water from springs in Selters and Fachingen addressed a letter of appreciation to the Nassau government in [[Wiesbaden]] for the rehabilitation of river systems. Overall, however, there seems to have been only repairs and temporary works accomplished through the 1830s.\n\nThe earliest attempts to count ship traffic on the Lahn dated from 1827. At the [[lock (water transport)|lock]] at Runkel, 278 vessels were counted in that year, with the state government of Nassau explicitly pointing out that most of the river traffic travelled from the mouth to Limburg, or with smaller boats from the upper reaches to Weilburg, and only a small part passed Runkel. In 1833, however, 464 vessels were counted. The main reason for the increase is likely the increase in [[iron ore]] mining in the surroundings of Weilburg. An estimate from 1840 placed the quantity of iron ore transported on the entire river at approximately 2000 boat loads, though the river was only navigable from the mouth to Weilburg. In addition, mainly cereals and mineral water were transported downriver. Upriver, the boats carried primarily coal, charcoal, gypsum, and colonial goods. Around 1835, about 80 larger shallow-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] boats were in operation on the Lahn.\n\nGiven the increasing ore mining in the Lahn Valley, officials from Nassau and Prussia in 1841 made an inspection trip along the river from Marburg to the Rhine. The Prussians were the driving force behind river expansion projects, seeking to establish a connection between Wetzlar and their [[Rhine Province]] and to secure the iron ore supply for the growing industry in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] Valley. Until 1844, [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] also joined expansion efforts, while [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] declined participation. The participating governments agreed to make the Lahn passable as far as Gie\u00dfen for boats that were significantly larger than the existing vehicles on the river. In Prussian territory, the work was largely completed by 1847, including construction of locks in Dorlar, Wetzlar, Wetzlar-Blechwalze, Oberbiel and Niederbiel. In Nassau's territory, locks were built at L\u00f6hnberg, Villmar, and Balduinstein, as well as the greatest technical achievement: the Weilburg ship tunnel. The river bank reinforcement and channel deepening along Nassau's section of the Lahn, however, was slow. Moreover, when the lock at Limburg fell short of the width contractually agreed upon, Nassau refused an extension. This led to several clashes between Nassau and Prussia in the following years until Nassau had finally fulfilled its obligations in 1855.\n\nDespite the expansion, boats on the Lahn could travel fully loaded only from Gie\u00dfen to L\u00f6hnberg. There, they had to lighten their load in order to reduce their draft and continue the journey. Also, this was only during two to three months. In a further four to five months per year, the load had to be reduced even earlier due to the low water level. The rest of the year the Lahn was not passable. From Wetzlar to Lahnstein, where the freight was unloaded onto the large barges of the Rhine, the boats took three to four days. A trip from Wetzlar to the mouth and then towed back with horses lasted for about 14 days in good conditions. At that time, there were mainly two types of transport boats in use: those with a capacity of 350 hundredweights and a larger variant with a capacity of 1300 hundredweights.\n\nIn 1857 to 1863, the [[Lahn Valley Railway]] (''Lahntalbahn'') was built, with nine major bridges and 18 tunnels along the river. Afterward, Prussia and Nassau tried to keep shipping along the Lahn alive through the lowering of tariffs. Ultimately, however, rail gained acceptance as a means of transport and cargo shipping on the Lahn gradually declined. Several projects begun in 1854 to operate steamboats on the Lahn died in their infancy. In 1875, 1885 and 1897 the Prussian government discussed plans for the transformation of the Lahn into a canal, which would allow the passage for larger vessels, but these plans were never implemented. Only in places was the riverbed dredged, such as around 1880 near Runkel, from 1905 to 1907 from the mouth to Bad Ems, and from 1925 to 1928 from the mouth to Steeden.\n\nIn 1964, an expansion of the Lahn for 300-ton vessels was completed. In 1981, freight shipping on the Lahn came to an end. Today, the Lahn is used exclusively for recreational boats.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 1960, gravel mining began in the broad plains of the Lahn Valley in Marburg and Giessen. This ended in 1996 and large sections of Lahn Valley in Hesse were set aside as a nature reserve\n\nOn February 7, 1984, the Lahn experienced a 100-year flood, which caused millions of German Marks in damage. This has since led to a central flood warning system and coordination of flood control efforts through the regional council of Giessen.\n\n== Boating ==\nThe Lahn, from a point between Lahnau and Dutenhofen (Wetzlar) to its confluence the Rhine, is designated as a federal waterway. In this area, it is subject to the Water and Shipping Administration of the federal government, with the responsible office being that at Koblenz.\n\nThe middle and lower section of the Lahn is navigable and has a large number of locks. The waterway is used almost exclusively by smaller motor yachts for tourists, as well as [[Watercraft paddling|paddled-]] and [[Watercraft rowing|rowboats]]. For non-motorized watercraft, the Lahn can be used for the entire length between Roth (of [[Weimar (Lahn)|Weimar]]) and the Rhine.\n\nFrom the mouth upwards to Dehrn (of [[Runkel]]), Lahn-km 70 (above Limburg), the river is consistently passable for larger vessels, with locks operated by personnel. The Water and Shipping Administration guarantees a minimum water depth of 1.60 m in the navigation channel. There are [[stream gauge]]s at Kalkofen (of [[D\u00f6rnberg]]) (normal water level 1.80 m) and at [[Leun]]. Above Dehrn there are manual locks and frequent shoals, making the passage of boats difficult. Two weirs in Wetzlar are an obstruction to shipping further upriver.\n\n== Economy and tourism ==\n[[File:Umleitung f\u00fcr den Radverkehr in Marburg wegen Bauarbeiten an Weidenh\u00e4user Br\u00fccke 2018-03-20.jpg|thumb|Cycling route signs of 'Lahntalradweg' from [[University of Marburg]] Cafeteria on bank of the Lahn river to the North and the South of trail (March 2017)]]\nSince the late 1980s, there have been increasing attempts to promote the Lahn for ecotourism and to coordinate and expand the existing uses. There were first tourism associations at the state level, and these have now joined together into the Lahntal Tourist Association.\n\nThe Lahntal bike path 'Lahntalradweg' leads through the Lahn Valley, along the Lahn Holiday Road. It is accessible from the [[Upper Lahn Valley Railway]] between Feudingen and Marburg, the [[Main-Weser Railway]] between Marburg and Giessen, as well as the [[Lahn Valley Railway]] between Giessen and Friedrichssegen. For walkers there is the Lahnh\u00f6henwege along both sides of the Lahn from Wetzlar to Oberlahnstein. The first partial section of a [[pilgrimage]] route, the Lahn-Camino on the left side of the Lahn, leads from Wetzlar Cathedral to Lahnstein via Castle Lahneck and the Hospital Chapel.\n\nThere are 19 [[hydroelectric]] plants using the Lahn to generate electricity. Wine is produced in Obernhof and Wein\u00e4hr. The wines of the Lahn region are marketed under the trade name Lahntal as Middle Rhine wines.\n\n==Fauna and flora==\nIn 1999, the Lahn was classified as Biological Grade II and Chemical Grade I. Overall it is considered natural. The migrations of fish such as salmon are hindered by the river's weirs and water levels, but attempts have been made through the installation of fish ladders to reintroduce formerly native fish. After the end of gravel mining in mid-1990s, the river between Lahnau, Heuchelheim, and Dutenhofen (of Wetzlar) in the middle Lahn Valley has developed into one of the largest nature reserves in Hesse, known as the Lahnau Nature Preserve.\n\n== Tributaries ==\nThe two most important tributaries of the Lahn, and those with the largest catchment inflows, are the [[Ohm (river)|Ohm]] and the [[Dill (river)|Dill]]. The Dill originates in the southwestern foothills of the [[Rothaar Mountains|Rothaargebirge]] (the ''Haincher H\u00f6he'') and enters the Lahn from the right. The Ohm flows from the [[Vogelsberg]] and enters from the left. It is notable that not only is the Ohm at the point of its confluence with the Lahn only one kilometre shorter from its source than the Lahn itself, but the Ohm's catchment area of {{convert|984|km2|mi2}} is significantly larger than that of the Lahn above the confluence, {{convert|652|km2|mi2}}, or only {{convert|452|km2|mi2}} before the inflow of the Wetschaft only 2 kilometres upstream.<ref>[http://geoextra.hmulv.hessen.de/wrrl_viewer/viewer.htm WRRL Hessen viewer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601034411/http://geoextra.hmulv.hessen.de/wrrl_viewer/viewer.htm |date=2009-06-01 }}</ref>\n\nBetween the Lahn's source area in the Rothaargebirge and [[Gie\u00dfen]], all of the left tributaries are from the less mountainous parts of the [[West Hessian Bergland]]. After the turn towards the west or southwest near Gie\u00dfen, all the left tributaries flow from the Hochtaunus. The right tributaries between the source area and the confluence of the Dill near Wetzlar come from the [[Gladenbach Bergland]], while downstream they originate in the (High) Westerwald. Much of the Westerwald, in contrast, has no significant watershed, so the streams are almost random in finding their direction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hucke |first=Hermann-Josef (ed.)|title=Gro\u00dfer Westerwaldf\u00fchrer |publisher=Verlag [[Westerwald-Verein]] eV|location=Montabaur |year=1991|edition=3rd|isbn=3-921548-04-7|language=German}}</ref>\n\nBecause the highest point of the Westerwald is near the [[Sieg]], and especially because the Taunus is very close to the [[Main (river)|Main]], both [[Mittelgebirge]] are each considerably more than half drained by the Lahn. Especially the left tributaries from the Taunus flow with a strong south-north orientation. The river [[Emsbach]] runs through the Idstein Basin, which divides the (Hinter-) Taunus into two parts, while the [[Aar]] is central for the (Western and Eastern) Aartaunus.\n\n===Table of important tributaries ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Its course passes through the [[States of Germany|federal states]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (23.0&nbsp;km), [[Hesse]] (165.6&nbsp;km), and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (57.0&nbsp;km).\n\nIt has its source in the [[Rothaar Mountains|Rothaargebirge]], the highest part of the [[Sauerland]]. It meets the [[Rhine]] at [[Lahnstein]], near [[Koblenz]]. Important cities along the Lahn include [[Marburg]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], [[Limburg an der Lahn]], [[Weilburg]] and [[Bad Ems]].\n\nTributaries to the Lahn include the [[Ohm (river)|Ohm]], [[Dill (river)|Dill]], the [[Weil (river)|Weil]] and the [[Aar (Lahn)|Aar]]. The lower Lahn has many [[dams]] with [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], allowing regular shipping from its [[mouth (river)|mouth]] up to [[Runkel]]. Riverboats also operate on a small section north of the dam in Gie\u00dfen.\n\n==Source area==\n[[File:Lahnquelle Lahnhof.jpg|thumb|Source of the Lahn at the Lahnhof]]The Lahn is a {{convert|245.6|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}-long, right (or eastern) [[tributary]] of the [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]]. Its course passes through the [[States of Germany|federal states]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (23.0&nbsp;km), [[Hesse]] (165.6&nbsp;km), and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (57.0&nbsp;km).\n\nThe Lahn originates at the Lahnhof, a locality of Nenkersdorf, which is a constituent community of [[Netphen]] in southeastern North Rhine-Westphalia, near the border with Hesse. The source area is situated along the Eisenstra\u00dfe scenic highway and the [[Rothaarsteig]] hiking trail.\n\nThe river arises in the southeastern Rothaargebirge in the Ederkopf-Lahnkopf-R\u00fccken ridge-line natural area. This ridge is the [[drainage divide]] between the Rhine and [[Weser]], and, within the Rhine system, the watershed between the rivers Lahn and [[Sieg]].\n\nThe source is at an elevation of {{convert|600|m|ft|sp=us}} and is located southwest of the {{convert|624|m|ft|abbr=on}} high Lahnkopf. In the vicinity are also the origins of the [[Eder]] (5.5&nbsp;km northwest of the Lahnhof) and the Sieg (another 3&nbsp;km north). Whereas the Sieg takes the shortest route to the Rhine (to the west), the Lahn first runs in the opposite direction, paralleling the Eder for many kilometers.\n\n==Course==\nThe Lahn first flows in a northeasterly direction through the southeastern Rothaargebirge and its foothills. From about the [[Bad Laasphe]] community of Feudingen, it turns primarily to the east.\n\n===Upper Lahntal and Wetschaft Depression===\n[[File:Lahn Wetschaft.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The confluence of the Wetschaft with the Lahn]][[File:Laasphe De Merian Hassiae 144.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Upper Lahn Valley at Bad Laasphe from the ''Topographia Hassiae'' of Matth\u00e4us Merian, 1655]]The section of the Lahn below the town of Bad Laasphe is geographically known as the Upper Lahn Valley ([[German language|German]]: Ober Lahntal). Above Bad Laasphe, where the river flows between the Rothaargebirge on the left (i.e. to the north) and the [[Gladenbach Uplands]] on the right, the Lahn Valley is simply considered part of these mountains.\n\nBetween Niederlaasphe (of Bad Laasphe) and Wallau (of [[Biedenkopf]]), the river crosses the border between North-Rhine Westphalia and Hesse. It then flows in an easterly direction through some districts of Biedenkopf (but not the central town) and the towns of [[Dautphetal]] and [[Lahntal]]. It is joined from the right by the [[Perf (Lahn)|Perf]] at Wallau and at Friedensdorf (of Dautphetal) by the [[Dautphe]] (which flows in a side valley to the south).\n\nShortly after the village of Caldern (of Lahn Valley), the ridgeline of the Rothaargebirge on the north ends with the Wollenberg and that of the Gladenbach Bergland with the Hungert. The Lahn leaves the [[Rhenish Slate Mountains]] for a long section and reaches the [[West Hesse Highlands]], where it flows through the extreme south of the [[Wetschaft Depression]], north of the Marburger R\u00fccken. Where the [[Wetschaft]] flows into it from the Burgwald forest in the north (near the Lahntal village of G\u00f6ttingen), the Lahn immediately changes direction by 90\u00b0 to the right.\n\n=== Marburg-Gie\u00dfen Lahntal ===\nThe now southward-flowing Lahn then enters the Marburg-Gie\u00dfen Lahntal. Shortly before [[C\u00f6lbe]], the [[Ohm (river)|Ohm]] enters from the left at the ''Lahn-Knie'' named area. Flowing from the [[Vogelsberg]] through the ''Ohmtal'', the Ohm is the Lahn's longest tributary, with a length of {{convert|59.7|km|mi}}.\n\nThe river then breaks through a [[sandstone]] [[mesa]] (the Marburger R\u00fccken to the west and the Lahnberge to the east) into a valley which encompasses the entire territory of the city of [[Marburg]] and its suburbs. The valley begins after the river passes the Marburger R\u00fccken near [[Weimar (Lahn)|Niederweimar]], where the [[Allna]] enters from the right. At the valley's southern end, the [[Zwesten Ohm]] enters from the Lahnberge. The right (western) side of the valley is again formed by the Gladenbacher Bergland, from which the [[Salzb\u00f6de]] enters the Lahn. On the left rises the Lumda Plateau, from which the eponymous river [[Lumda (river)|Lumda]] flows into the Lahn near [[Lollar]]. Gradually the valley widens into the [[Gie\u00dfen Basin]].\n\n[[File:Heuchelheimer See.jpg|thumb|Heuchelheim Lake]]In [[Gie\u00dfen]], after the inflow of the [[Wieseck (river)|Wieseck]] from the left, the Lahn's general direction of flow changes from the south to the west. The Gie\u00dfen Basin extends a few more miles downstream to Atzbach, a suburb of [[Lahnau]]. From the 1960s until the 1980s, there was extensive [[gravel]] mining in this area. The area between [[Heuchelheim]], Lahnau, and the [[Wetzlar]] borough of Dutenhofen was to be completely mined and a water sports center with an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-suitable [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] course built. This plan was partly realized, and the Heuchelheim Lake and Dutenhofen Lake are now popular recreational destinations for the surrounding region. Nature conservation organizations, however, were able to prevent further gravel mining, so the area is now one of the largest [[nature reserves]] in Hesse. Dutenhofen Lake marks Kilometer 0 of the Lahn as a federal waterway.\n\nThe Gie\u00dfen Basin is surrounded by the mountain peaks of the Gleiberg, the Vetzberg, the D\u00fcnsberg, and the Schiffenberg.  At Wetzlar, the Lahn is joined by its second longest tributary, the [[Dill (river)|Dill]], which has a length of {{convert|55.0|km|mi}}. At this location, the valleys of the Lahn and Dill separate three parts of the Rhenish Slate Mountains from each other: the Gladenbach Bergland, the [[Westerwald]] to the northwest, and the [[Taunus]] to the south.\n\n===Weilburg Lahntal===\n[[File:Lahntunnel Weilburg.JPG|thumb|Weilburg boat tunnel]]After Wetzlar, the valley of the Lahn gradually narrows and at Leun enters the Weilburger Lahntal. The Weilburger Lahntal belongs to the larger Gie\u00dfen-Koblenzer Lahntal physiographic province, considered part of the Rhenish Slate Mountains.\n\nIn the upper area of the Weilburg Lahntal (the L\u00f6hnberg Basin) are [[mineral springs]], such as the famous [[Selters (Lahn)|Selters]] mineral spring in the municipality of [[L\u00f6hnberg]]. In the lower area, where the river turns again to the south, the Lahn is entrenched canyon-like below the level of the surrounding geographic trough.\n\nThe city of [[Weilburg]] is wrapped by a marked loop of the river. The neck of this noose is traversed by a boat tunnel, unique in Germany. A little below Weilburg, the [[Weil (river)|Weil]], originating in the High Taunus, enters the Lahn.\n\n===Limburger Basin===\nAt Aumenau in the municipality of [[Villmar]], the course of the Lahn reverses to the west again and enters the fertile Limburger Basin, where the river is incised to a depth of about {{convert|50|m|ft}}. Here the river is joined by two tributaries, the [[Emsbach]] coming from the Taunus and the [[Elbbach (Lahn)|Elbbach]] from the Westerwald. In this area are frequent outcroppings of [[Devonian]] [[limestone]], the so-called Lahn Marble (German: ''Lahnmarmor''), such as at [[Limburg an der Lahn]], where the [[Limburg Cathedral]] crowns such an outcropping. At Limburg, the river again enters a wider valley.\n\n===Lower Lahntal===\nBelow [[Diez, Germany|Diez]], the Lahn absorbs the [[Aar (Lahn)|Aar]] from the south. At Fachingen in the municipality of [[Birlenbach]], it leaves the Limburger Basin and enters the Lower Lahntal.  Its course is incised over {{convert|200|m|ft}} deep in the Slate Mountains. Near [[Obernhof]], the [[Gelbach]] enters the Lahn opposite [[Arnstein Abbey]]. Then, after passing [[Nassau, Germany|Nassau]] and [[Bad Ems]], where, as in Fachingen, mineral springs (sources of Emser salt) can be found, it completes its {{convert|242|km|mi|abbr=on}} run, entering the Rhine in [[Lahnstein]], located five kilometers south of [[Koblenz]] at an elevation of {{convert|61|m|ft}}.\n\n[[File:Lahnmundung.jpg|thumb|center|Confluence of the Lahn with the Rhine near Niederlahnstein (opposite [[Koblenz]]-Stolzenfels with Schloss Stolzenfels)|950px]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe Lahn area was settled as early as in the [[Stone Age]], as shown by [[archeological]] finds near Diez, in Steeden in the community of [[Runkel]], and in Wetzlar. Recent discoveries in Dalheim on the western edge of Wetzlar show a ca. 7000-year-old [[Linear Pottery culture]] settlement. There are also remains a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] settlement in the location, dated to around the 1st century, situated above a bend of the Lahn.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Era, the Lahn presumably was used by the Romans to supply their fort at Bad Ems, Kastell Ems. Here the ''[[Limes Germanicus]]'' on the borders of [[Germania Superior]] and [[Rhaetia]] crossed the Lahn. Archaeological finds are known from Niederlahnstein, as well as from Lahnau. One Lahnau site, the [[Waldgirmes Forum]] in the community of Waldgirmes, was discovered in the 1990s and had been the site of a Roman town. Another site in the community of Dorlar has the remains of a Roman marching camp (or ''[[castra]]''). These Lahnau sites have significant altered the current understanding of the history of the Romans east of the Rhine and north of the ''Limes''.\n\nDuring the [[Migration Period]], the [[Alamanni]] settled in the lower Lahntal. They were later ousted by the [[Franks]].\n\nThe origin and meaning of the name Lahn are uncertain; it is possible that it is a pre-Germanic word. The form of the name changed over time; before 600, variations like Laugona, Logana, Logene or Loyn are typical. The oldest known use of the current spelling of the name dates to 1365.\n\nThe oldest mention of the [[staple right]] of Diez dates to the early 14th century and is an indication of significant shipping on the Lahn by that time. In 1559, [[John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg|John VI]] of [[Nassau-Dillenburg]] laid out a [[towpath]] on the lower Lahn. In 1606, for the first time, the Lahn was deepened to allow small scale shipping and the lower reaches became navigable for four to five months of the year. However, there were numerous [[weir]]s with only narrow gaps, so the traffic remained restricted to small boats.\n\nIn the 17th and early 18th centuries, there were several initiatives of adjacent princes to further expand the Lahn as a waterway, but they all failed due to lack of coordination. In 1740, the [[Archbishopric of Trier]] began construction to make the mouth of the Lahn passable for larger vessels. In winter of 1753/54, bank stabilization and creation of towpaths were done along the entire length of the river. Then the river was passable for vessels with up to 240 [[hundredweight]]s of cargo downstream and up to 160 hundredweights upstream.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, over 300 castles, fortresses, fortified churches, and similar buildings were built along the river.\n\n===Shipping during the Industrial Revolution===\nDuring the [[First French Empire|French occupation]], inspections of the river began in 1796, which were to be followed by a comprehensive expansion. Due to political developments, however, this expansion did not take place. The newly created [[Duchy of Nassau]] eventually began work from 1808 under the Chief Construction Inspector of [[Kirn]] to make the Lahn fully navigable. In the first winter, the section of the riverside from the mouth to Limburg was stabilized, particularly so that the course could be narrowed in shallow places. It was planned in the long run to make the Lahn navigable as far as Marburg and from there to construct a [[canal]] to [[Fulda]] to connect it with the [[Weser]]. This would create a waterway from France to [[North Sea]] via the states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Upstream of Limburg, however, the work was slow, partly because the population pressed into emergency service only reluctantly cooperated. Large parts of the shore were only secured with [[fascine]]s, which rotted shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 1816 the Duchy of Nassau and the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] agreed to expand the Lahn as far as Giessen, where it joined the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. Little is known about the work that followed, but in the 1825 boatmen on the Lahn who shipped mineral water from springs in Selters and Fachingen addressed a letter of appreciation to the Nassau government in [[Wiesbaden]] for the rehabilitation of river systems. Overall, however, there seems to have been only repairs and temporary works accomplished through the 1830s.\n\nThe earliest attempts to count ship traffic on the Lahn dated from 1827. At the [[lock (water transport)|lock]] at Runkel, 278 vessels were counted in that year, with the state government of Nassau explicitly pointing out that most of the river traffic travelled from the mouth to Limburg, or with smaller boats from the upper reaches to Weilburg, and only a small part passed Runkel. In 1833, however, 464 vessels were counted. The main reason for the increase is likely the increase in [[iron ore]] mining in the surroundings of Weilburg. An estimate from 1840 placed the quantity of iron ore transported on the entire river at approximately 2000 boat loads, though the river was only navigable from the mouth to Weilburg. In addition, mainly cereals and mineral water were transported downriver. Upriver, the boats carried primarily coal, charcoal, gypsum, and colonial goods. Around 1835, about 80 larger shallow-[[Draft (hull)|draft]] boats were in operation on the Lahn.\n\nGiven the increasing ore mining in the Lahn Valley, officials from Nassau and Prussia in 1841 made an inspection trip along the river from Marburg to the Rhine. The Prussians were the driving force behind river expansion projects, seeking to establish a connection between Wetzlar and their [[Rhine Province]] and to secure the iron ore supply for the growing industry in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] Valley. Until 1844, [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]] also joined expansion efforts, while [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] declined participation. The participating governments agreed to make the Lahn passable as far as Gie\u00dfen for boats that were significantly larger than the existing vehicles on the river. In Prussian territory, the work was largely completed by 1847, including construction of locks in Dorlar, Wetzlar, Wetzlar-Blechwalze, Oberbiel and Niederbiel. In Nassau's territory, locks were built at L\u00f6hnberg, Villmar, and Balduinstein, as well as the greatest technical achievement: the Weilburg ship tunnel. The river bank reinforcement and channel deepening along Nassau's section of the Lahn, however, was slow. Moreover, when the lock at Limburg fell short of the width contractually agreed upon, Nassau refused an extension. This led to several clashes between Nassau and Prussia in the following years until Nassau had finally fulfilled its obligations in 1855.\n\nDespite the expansion, boats on the Lahn could travel fully loaded only from Gie\u00dfen to L\u00f6hnberg. There, they had to lighten their load in order to reduce their draft and continue the journey. Also, this was only during two to three months. In a further four to five months per year, the load had to be reduced even earlier due to the low water level. The rest of the year the Lahn was not passable. From Wetzlar to Lahnstein, where the freight was unloaded onto the large barges of the Rhine, the boats took three to four days. A trip from Wetzlar to the mouth and then towed back with horses lasted for about 14 days in good conditions. At that time, there were mainly two types of transport boats in use: those with a capacity of 350 hundredweights and a larger variant with a capacity of 1300 hundredweights.\n\nIn 1857 to 1863, the [[Lahn Valley Railway]] (''Lahntalbahn'') was built, with nine major bridges and 18 tunnels along the river. Afterward, Prussia and Nassau tried to keep shipping along the Lahn alive through the lowering of tariffs. Ultimately, however, rail gained acceptance as a means of transport and cargo shipping on the Lahn gradually declined. Several projects begun in 1854 to operate steamboats on the Lahn died in their infancy. In 1875, 1885 and 1897 the Prussian government discussed plans for the transformation of the Lahn into a canal, which would allow the passage for larger vessels, but these plans were never implemented. Only in places was the riverbed dredged, such as around 1880 near Runkel, from 1905 to 1907 from the mouth to Bad Ems, and from 1925 to 1928 from the mouth to Steeden.\n\nIn 1964, an expansion of the Lahn for 300-ton vessels was completed. In 1981, freight shipping on the Lahn came to an end. Today, the Lahn is used exclusively for recreational boats.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 1960, gravel mining began in the broad plains of the Lahn Valley in Marburg and Giessen. This ended in 1996 and large sections of Lahn Valley in Hesse were set aside as a nature reserve\n\nOn February 7, 1984, the Lahn experienced a 100-year flood, which caused millions of German Marks in damage. This has since led to a central flood warning system and coordination of flood control efforts through the regional council of Giessen.\n\n== Boating ==\nThe Lahn, from a point between Lahnau and Dutenhofen (Wetzlar) to its confluence the Rhine, is designated as a federal waterway. In this area, it is subject to the Water and Shipping Administration of the federal government, with the responsible office being that at Koblenz.\n\nThe middle and lower section of the Lahn is navigable and has a large number of locks. The waterway is used almost exclusively by smaller motor yachts for tourists, as well as [[Watercraft paddling|paddled-]] and [[Watercraft rowing|rowboats]]. For non-motorized watercraft, the Lahn can be used for the entire length between Roth (of [[Weimar (Lahn)|Weimar]]) and the Rhine.\n\nFrom the mouth upwards to Dehrn (of [[Runkel]]), Lahn-km 70 (above Limburg), the river is consistently passable for larger vessels, with locks operated by personnel. The Water and Shipping Administration guarantees a minimum water depth of 1.60 m in the navigation channel. There are [[stream gauge]]s at Kalkofen (of [[D\u00f6rnberg]]) (normal water level 1.80 m) and at [[Leun]]. Above Dehrn there are manual locks and frequent shoals, making the passage of boats difficult. Two weirs in Wetzlar are an obstruction to shipping further upriver.\n\n== Economy and tourism ==\n[[File:Umleitung f\u00fcr den Radverkehr in Marburg wegen Bauarbeiten an Weidenh\u00e4user Br\u00fccke 2018-03-20.jpg|thumb|Cycling route signs of 'Lahntalradweg' from [[University of Marburg]] Cafeteria on bank of the Lahn river to the North and the South of trail (March 2017)]]\nSince the late 1980s, there have been increasing attempts to promote the Lahn for ecotourism and to coordinate and expand the existing uses. There were first tourism associations at the state level, and these have now joined together into the Lahntal Tourist Association.\n\nThe Lahntal bike path 'Lahntalradweg' leads through the Lahn Valley, along the Lahn Holiday Road. It is accessible from the [[Upper Lahn Valley Railway]] between Feudingen and Marburg, the [[Main-Weser Railway]] between Marburg and Giessen, as well as the [[Lahn Valley Railway]] between Giessen and Friedrichssegen. For walkers there is the Lahnh\u00f6henwege along both sides of the Lahn from Wetzlar to Oberlahnstein. The first partial section of a [[pilgrimage]] route, the Lahn-Camino on the left side of the Lahn, leads from Wetzlar Cathedral to Lahnstein via Castle Lahneck and the Hospital Chapel.\n\nThere are 19 [[hydroelectric]] plants using the Lahn to generate electricity. Wine is produced in Obernhof and Wein\u00e4hr. The wines of the Lahn region are marketed under the trade name Lahntal as Middle Rhine wines.\n\n==Fauna and flora==\nIn 1999, the Lahn was classified as Biological Grade II and Chemical Grade I. Overall it is considered natural. The migrations of fish such as salmon are hindered by the river's weirs and water levels, but attempts have been made through the installation of fish ladders to reintroduce formerly native fish. After the end of gravel mining in mid-1990s, the river between Lahnau, Heuchelheim, and Dutenhofen (of Wetzlar) in the middle Lahn Valley has developed into one of the largest nature reserves in Hesse, known as the Lahnau Nature Preserve.\n\n== Tributaries ==\nThe two most important tributaries of the Lahn, and those with the largest catchment inflows, are the [[Ohm (river)|Ohm]] and the [[Dill (river)|Dill]]. The Dill originates in the southwestern foothills of the [[Rothaar Mountains|Rothaargebirge]] (the ''Haincher H\u00f6he'') and enters the Lahn from the right. The Ohm flows from the [[Vogelsberg]] and enters from the left. It is notable that not only is the Ohm at the point of its confluence with the Lahn only one kilometre shorter from its source than the Lahn itself, but the Ohm's catchment area of {{convert|984|km2|mi2}} is significantly larger than that of the Lahn above the confluence, {{convert|652|km2|mi2}}, or only {{convert|452|km2|mi2}} before the inflow of the Wetschaft only 2 kilometres upstream.<ref>[http://geoextra.hmulv.hessen.de/wrrl_viewer/viewer.htm WRRL Hessen viewer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601034411/http://geoextra.hmulv.hessen.de/wrrl_viewer/viewer.htm |date=2009-06-01 }}</ref>\n\nBetween the Lahn's source area in the Rothaargebirge and [[Gie\u00dfen]], all of the left tributaries are from the less mountainous parts of the [[West Hessian Bergland]]. After the turn towards the west or southwest near Gie\u00dfen, all the left tributaries flow from the Hochtaunus. The right tributaries between the source area and the confluence of the Dill near Wetzlar come from the [[Gladenbach Bergland]], while downstream they originate in the (High) Westerwald. Much of the Westerwald, in contrast, has no significant watershed, so the streams are almost random in finding their direction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hucke |first=Hermann-Josef (ed.)|title=Gro\u00dfer Westerwaldf\u00fchrer |publisher=Verlag [[Westerwald-Verein]] eV|location=Montabaur |year=1991|edition=3rd|isbn=3-921548-04-7|language=German}}</ref>\n\nBecause the highest point of the Westerwald is near the [[Sieg]], and especially because the Taunus is very close to the [[Main (river)|Main]], both [[Mittelgebirge]] are each considerably more than half drained by the Lahn. Especially the left tributaries from the Taunus flow with a strong south-north orientation. The river [[Emsbach]] runs through the Idstein Basin, which divides the (Hinter-) Taunus into two parts, while the [[Aar]] is central for the (Western and Eastern) Aartaunus.\n\n===Table of important tributaries ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
