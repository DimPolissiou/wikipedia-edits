J. Cherryh]].  It was first published in a hardcover edition by [[Ballantine Books]] under its [[Del Rey Books]] imprint, and featured cover art by Cherryh's brother, [[David A. Cherry]].\n\n==Backstory==\nThe [[goblin]]s, who once had access to human lands, were banished to their own [[Parallel universe (fiction)|realm]] because of their misdeeds. But before they departed they left signs and clues as to how they could be contacted. They could not return unless they were summoned.\n\nHundreds of years later, Mirela, a witch and queen of Hasel, read these signs and asked the goblins for help. Her daughter and [[Beneficiary|heir]], Ylena was vain and ungrateful and Mirela did not want her to become queen when she died. The goblin queen gave Mirela a [[potion]] of youth and beauty in exchange for access to the world of man for one night a year. Mirela's eternal youth infuriated Ylena and ''she'' stuck a bargain with the goblin queen: advice on how to depose Mirela in exchange for access to human lands for a year. One night Mirela died mysteriously and Ylena became queen. Even though Ylena did not want an heir, she still had a daughter, Ytresse, and suspected goblin treachery because Ytresse's magic was too strong for her. On the last day of the goblins' time on earth, the goblin queen offered Ylena another deal: Ylena would live for as long as the goblins possessed a small lake nearby. Ylena assented and the goblins gained unfettered access to human lands with the lake the goblin queen's center of power. Ylena, trapped by her bargains with the goblins, wanted no more to do with them. But Azdra'ik, a goblin lord and leader of a goblin rebellion against their queen, offered Ylena a secret in exchange for three wishes. The secret was that the goblin queen's power lay in a magic mirror. Azdra'ik got his wishes and Ylena set about constructing her own mirror into which she put every spell she knew. When the goblin queen found out about Ylena's mirror, she sent a goblin army to find and destroy it. Ylena was defeated, her mirror reduced to dust, and Hasel left in ruins. But the price the goblin queen paid for this victory was that ''her'' mirror cracked in two and a shard fell off. Azdra'ik stole the shard and gave it to Ytresse. Ytresse did not trust the goblin queen and arranged her own heir, Ylysse without the goblins' interference. Ytresse in turn passed power, and the shard, onto her heir, Ysabel. Ysabel and her twin brother, Karoly were apprenticed to Ytresse's daughter, Urzula.\n\nSeeking to escape Ytresse's sphere of influence, Urzula took Karoly over the mountain where she married lord Ladislaw of Maggiar and gave birth to Stani, who later became the new lord. Karoly became Stani's wizard but Urzula never practised her magic in Maggiar. When Urzula (lady Gran) died she left the Stani household with tales of witches and magic from \"over-mountain\".\n\n==Plot summary==\nAn ill-wind disturbs the peaceful land of Maggiar and the wizard, Karoly requests leave to consult with his sister, Ysabel over the mountain. Lord Stani instructs his two eldest sons, Bogdan and Tamas, and his master huntsman, Nikolai to accompany Karoly. After a difficult trip over the mountain, they approach a tower, Krukczy Straz where they hope to find shelter, but are ambushed by goblins. The goblins have overrun the tower, killing all inside. Tamas is separated from the others but is rescued by Ela, a witchling who takes him to her mistress, Ysabel in a neighboring tower, Tajny Straz. But this tower has also been raided by goblins and all are killed, including Ysabel. Ela goes into the tower and retrieves Ysabel's shard from the goblin mirror. Then Azdra'ik, the goblin lord appears, but does not threaten them. He tells Tamas he must take the mirror fragment from Ela because it is too powerful for her to use. Ela takes Tamas to the next tower at the ruins of what was Hasel. Here Ela looks into the mirror but is overwhelmed by the goblin queen staring back at her. Tamas is startled when the queen looks at ''him'' and calls him a wizard, which, he assures Ela he is not. Ela is drawn to the goblin queen at the lake and Tamas tries to follow her, but gets lost. Azdra'ik finds him and together they search for Ela.\n\nBack in Maggiar, Yuri, Tamas's younger brother has been left behind to look after Tamas's dog, Zadny. But Zadny, pining for his master, escapes his pen and tracks Tamas's scent over the mountain with Yuri in pursuit. Near Krukczy Straz, Yuri finds an injured Nikolai, and together they follow Zadny, still on Tamas's trail, to Tajny Straz. But by the time they get there, Tamas has already left. Then Karoly arrives and reveals to Nikolai the story of the succession of witches, their bargains with the goblin queen, and the mirror fragment. Karoly realizes that Ela must have the shard and says he must take it from her before she misuses it. The three then head for Hasel to find Ela. At Hasel, Zadny continues his pursuit of Tamas, and realising that Ela and Tamas must be together, they all follow Zadny.\n\nAzdra'ik and Tamas find Ela near the goblin lake. Much of the surrounding landscape has been devastated by marauding goblin armies and a darkness spreads from the lake. The goblin queen is expanding her sphere of influence. Ela is tempted to try the mirror again, but Tamas, slowly becoming aware of the wizard in him, convinces her otherwise.\n\nYuri, running ahead in pursuit of Zadny, stumbles into the goblin queen's hall. There he finds the goblin mirror and sees Bogdan in it. Bogdan, under the queen's spell, pulls Yuri into the mirror. Tamas arrives and tries to persuade Bogdan to free Yuri, but Bogdan challenges Tamas and in his rage is accidentally killed. Tamas and Ela confront the goblin queen. The shard returns to the mirror but with their combined magic they seize control of it and banish the goblin queen and her armies. Karoly and Nikolai arrive but the darkness is already receding. Karoly reveals that Azdra'ik used goblin magic to \"father\" Ytresse with Ylena and that Ela is Azdra'ik's great grand-daughter and Karoly's niece. Tamas, now in control of Azdra'ik, elects to let the goblin lords remain on earth.\n\n==Main characters==\n;Stani household\n*Lord Stani \u2013 lord of Maggiar\n*Bogdan \u2013 Stani's eldest son and heir\n*Tamas \u2013 Stani's second eldest son and nascent wizard\n*Yuri \u2013 Stani's youngest son, aged 14\n*Karoly \u2013 Stani's elderly wizard, Ysabel's twin brother, Urzula's apprentice\n*Nikolai \u2013 Stani's master huntsman\n*Zadny \u2013 Tamas's adopted stray dog\n;Witches\n*Mirela \u2013 queen of Hasel\n*Ylena \u2013 Mirela's daughter and heir\n*Ytresse \u2013 Ylena's daughter and heir\n*Ylysse \u2013 Ytresse's heir\n*Urzula (lady Gran) \u2013 Ylysse's daughter, Stani's mother, Nikolai's mother\n*Ysabel \u2013 Ylysse's heir, Karoly's twin sister, Urzula's apprentice\n*Ela \u2013 Ysabel's apprentice, Azdra'ik's great grand-daughter, Karoly's niece\n;Goblins\n*Azdra'ik ng'Saeich \u2013 goblin lord of the ''i'bu okhthi'' or noble goblins (taller than the ''itra'hi'' or worker/fighter goblins)\n\n==References==\n*C.

The term typically denotes the regional practices among the insular churches and their associates, rather than actual theological differences.\n\nThe term \"Celtic Church\" is deprecated by a few secular historians, as it implies a unified and identifiable entity entirely separate from that of mainstream Western [[Christendom]].<ref>{{harvnb|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|1995}}{{page needed|date=May 2017}}; {{harvnb|Charles-Edwards|2000}}{{page needed|date=May 2017}}; {{harvnb|Davies|1992|pp=12\u201321}}; {{harvnb|Hughes|1981|pp=1\u201320}}; Kathleen Hughes, ''The Church in Early English Society'' (London, 1966); W.

Some elements may have been introduced to [[Ireland]] by the [[Romano-British]] [[St. Patrick]], and later, others from [[Ireland]] to [[Great Britain|Britain]] through the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish mission system]] of Saint [[Columba]]. However, the histories of the [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Breton people|Breton]], [[Cornish people|Cornish]], and [[Manx people|Manx]] Churches diverge significantly after the 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Wormald|2006|pp=223\u2013224 n. 1}}</ref> Interest in the subject has led to a series of '''\"Celtic Christian Revival\"''' movements, which have shaped popular perceptions of the [[Celts (modern)|Celts]] and their religious practices, most notably [[Celtic Revival|Celtomania]].\n\n{{History of Celtic Christianity}}\n\n== Definitions ==\nPeople have conceived of \"Celtic Christianity\" in different ways at different times. Writings on the topic frequently say more about the time in which they originate than about the historical state of Christianity in the early medieval [[Celtic languages| Celtic-speaking world]], and many notions are now discredited in modern academic discourse.<ref>{{harvnb| Corning|2006|p= xii}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|pp= vii\u2013ix}}</ref> One particularly prominent feature ascribed to Celtic Christianity is that it is supposedly inherently distinct from \u2013 and generally opposed to \u2013 the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=Corning1>{{harvnb| Corning|2006|p= 1}}</ref> Other common claims include that Celtic Christianity denied the [[Papal supremacy| authority of the Pope]], was less authoritarian than the Catholic Church, more [[spirituality |spiritual]], friendlier to women, more connected with [[nature]], and more comfortable dealing with [[Celtic polytheism]].<ref name=Corning1/> One view, which gained substantial scholarly traction in the 19th century, was that there was a \"Celtic Church\", a significant organised Christian body or denomination uniting the Celtic peoples and separating them from the \"Roman\" church of continental Europe.<ref name=Koch432>{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p= 432}}</ref> Others have been content to speak of \"Celtic Christianity\" as consisting of certain traditions and beliefs intrinsic to the Celts.<ref name=Koch432434>{{harvnb|Koch|2006|pp= 432\u2013434}}</ref>\n\nHowever, modern scholars have identified problems with all of these claims, and find the term \"Celtic Christianity\" problematic in and of itself.<ref name=Koch431/> Modern scholarship roundly rejects the idea of a \"Celtic Church\" due to the lack of substantiating evidence.<ref name=Koch432434/> Indeed, distinct Irish and British church traditions existed, each with their own practices, and there was significant local variation even within the individual Irish and British spheres.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 4}}</ref> While the Irish and British churches had some traditions in common, these were relatively few. Even these commonalities did not exist due to the [[Celts|\"Celticity\"]] of the regions, but due to other historical and geographical factors.<ref name=Koch432/> Additionally, the Christians of Ireland and Britain were not \"anti-Roman\"; Celtic areas respected the authority of Rome and the papacy as strongly as any other region of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|pp= 1, 4}}</ref> [[Caitlin Corning]] further notes that the \"Irish and British were no more pro-women, pro-environment, or even more spiritual than the rest of the Church.\"<ref name=\"Corning1\"/>\n\n== Developing image of Celtic Christianity ==\nCorning writes that scholars have identified three major strands of thought that have influenced the popular conceptions of Celtic Christianity:\n\n* The first arose in the [[English Reformation]], when the [[Church of England]] declared itself separate from papal authority. [[Protestant]] writers of this time popularised the idea of an indigenous British Christianity that opposed the foreign \"Roman\" church and was purer (and [[proto-Protestant]]) in thought. The English church, they claimed, was not forming a new institution, but casting off the shackles of Rome and returning to its true roots as the indigenous national church of Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 2}}</ref>\n*  The [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] of the 18th century, in particular Romantic notions of the [[noble savage]] and the intrinsic qualities of the \"Celtic race\", further influenced ideas about Celtic Christianity. Romantics idealised the Celts as a primitive, bucolic people who were far more poetic, spiritual, and freer of [[rationalism]] than their neighbours.

Gregory intended for Augustine to become the [[metropolitan bishop]] over all of southern Britain, including the existing dioceses under Welsh and Cornish control. Augustine met with British bishops in a series of conferences \u2013 known as the [[Synod of Chester]] \u2013 that attempted to assert his authority and to compel them to abandon aspects of their service that had fallen out of line with Roman practice. The [[Northumbria]]n cleric [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' is the only surviving account of these meetings: according to it, some of the clerics of the nearest British province met Augustine at a site on the border of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] that was known thereafter as Augustine's Oak. Augustine focused on seeking assistance for his work among the Saxons and reforming the Britons' [[Easter controversy|obsolete method for calculating Easter]]; the clerics responded that they would need to confer with their people and await a larger assembly.<ref name=Lloyd174175>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref> Bede relates that the bishops particularly consulted a hermit on how to respond. He told them to respond based on Augustine's conduct: were he to rise to greet them, they would know him for a humble servant of Christ and should submit to his authority but, were he to remain seated, they would know him to be arrogant and prideful and should reject him. As it happened, Augustine did keep his seat, provoking outrage. In the negotiations that followed, he offered to allow the Britons to maintain all their native customs but three: they should adopt Rome's more advanced method of calculating the date of Easter, reform their baptismal ritual, and join the missionary efforts among the Saxons.

It was not until the death of [[Bishop of St Davids|Bishop]] [[Bernard (bishop of St Davids)|Bernard]] ({{circa|lk=no|1147}}) that St&nbsp;Davids finally abandoned its claims to metropolitan status and submitted to the [[Province of Canterbury]], by which point the popularity of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudohistorical ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' had begun spreading these inventions further afield.

The Romans (but not the French) then adopted the still-better work of [[Dionysius Exiguus|Dionysius]] in 525, which brought them into harmony with the [[Church of Alexandria]].\n\nIn the early 600s Christians in Ireland and Britain became aware of the divergence in dating between them and those in Europe. The first clash came in 602 when a synod of French bishops opposed the practices of the monasteries established by [[Columbanus|St&nbsp;Columbanus]]; Columbanus appealed to [[Pope Gregory I|the pope]] but received no answer and finally moved from their jurisdiction. It was a primary concern for [[Augustine of Canterbury|St&nbsp;Augustine]] and [[Gregorian mission|his mission]], although [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]]'s flight to [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and eventual restoration to his throne meant that Celtic practice was introduced to [[Northumbria]] until the 664 [[Synod of Whitby|synod in Whitby]]. The groups furthest away from the [[Gregorian mission]] were generally the readiest to acknowledge the superiority of the new tables: the bishops of southern Ireland adopted the continental system at the [[Synod of Mag L\u00e9ne]] ({{circa|lk=no|630}}); the {{circa|lk=no|697}} [[Council of Birr]] saw the northern Irish bishops follow suit. The [[Iona Abbey|abbey at Iona]] and its satellites held out until 716,<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=34}}</ref> while the Welsh did not adopt the Roman and Saxon ''[[computus]]'' until induced to do so around 768 by [[Elfodd]], [[bishop of Bangor|\"archbishop\" of Bangor]].\n\n===Monastic tonsure===\n[[File:Fra Angelico 052.jpg|left|thumb|The \"Roman\" [[tonsure]], in the shape of a crown, differing from the Irish tradition, which is unclear but involved shaving the hair from ear to ear in some fashion]]\nAll monks of the period, and apparently most or all clergy, kept a distinct [[tonsure]], or method of cutting one's hair, to distinguish their social identity as men of the cloth. In Ireland men otherwise wore longish hair, and a shaved head was worn by [[Slavery in the Early Middle Ages|slave]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Ryan|1931|p=217}}</ref>\n\nThe prevailing \"Roman\" custom was to shave a circle at the top of the head, leaving a halo of hair or ''corona''; this was eventually associated with the imagery of Christ's [[crown of thorns]].<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2003|p=146}}</ref> The early material referring to the Celtic tonsure emphasizes its distinctiveness from the Roman alternative and invariably connects its use to the Celtic dating of Easter.<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2003|p=140}}</ref> Those preferring the Roman tonsure considered the Celtic custom extremely unorthodox, and associated it with the form of tonsure worn by the [[heresiarch]] [[Simon Magus]].<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2003|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref> This association appears in a 672 letter from Saint [[Aldhelm]] to King [[Geraint of Dumnonia]], but it may have been circulating since the Synod of Whitby.<ref name=McCarthy141>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2003|p=141}}</ref> The tonsure is also mentioned in a passage, probably of the 7th century but attributed wrongly to Gildas: \"''Britones toti mundo contrarii, moribus Romanis inimici, non solum in missa sed in tonsura etiam''\" (\"Britons are contrary to the whole world, enemies of Roman customs, not only in the Mass but also in regard to the tonsure\").<ref>A.

Penitents were divided into a separate part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to Mass wearing [[sackcloth]] and ashes in a process known as ''exomologesis'' that often involved some form of general confession.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (''sacerdos''), and it seems that, for some sins, private penance was allowed instead.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=9\u201312}}</ref> Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included [[absolution]] at its conclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=13\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe Irish penitential practice spread throughout the continent, where the form of public penance had fallen into disuse. Saint [[Columbanus]] was credited with introducing the ''medicamenta paentitentiae'', the \"medicines of penance\", to Gaul at a time when they had come to be neglected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2003|p=252}}</ref> Though the process met some resistance, by 1215 the practice had become established as the norm, with the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] establishing a canonical statute requiring confession at a minimum of once per year.\n\n===Peregrinatio===\nA final distinctive tradition common across Britain and Ireland was the popularity of ''peregrinatio pro Christo'' (\"exile for Christ\"). The term ''peregrinatio'' is [[Latin]], and referred to the state of living or sojourning away from one's homeland in [[Roman law]]. It was later used by the [[Church Fathers]], in particular Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who wrote that Christians should live a life of ''peregrinatio'' in the present world while awaiting the [[Kingdom of God]]. Augustine's version of ''peregrinatio'' spread widely throughout the Christian church, but it took two additional unique meanings in Celtic countries.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn the first sense, the penitentials prescribed permanent or temporary ''peregrinatio'' as penance for certain infractions. Additionally, there was a tradition of undertaking a voluntary ''peregrinatio pro Christo'', in which individuals permanently left their homes and put themselves entirely in God's hands. In the Irish tradition there were two types of such ''peregrinatio'', the \"lesser\" peregrinatio, involving leaving one's home area but not the island, and the \"superior\" peregrinatio, which meant leaving Ireland for good. This voluntary exile to spend one's life in a foreign land far from friends and family came to be termed the \"white martyrdom\".<ref name=woods>{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |last=Woods |first=Richard |title=The Spirituality of the Celtic Church |journal=Spirituality Today |date=Fall 1985 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=243\u2013255 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103040938/http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |archive-date=3 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMost ''peregrini'' or exiles of this type were seeking personal spiritual fulfilment, but many became involved in missionary endeavours. The Briton [[Saint Patrick]] became the evangelist of Ireland during what he called his ''peregrinatio'' there, while [[Samson of Dol|Saint Samson]] left his home to ultimately become bishop in [[Brittany]]. The Irishmen [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]] similarly founded highly important religious communities after leaving their homes.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio/> Irish-educated English Christians such as [[Gerald of Mayo]], the [[Two Ewalds]], [[Willehad]], [[Willibrord]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Ceolfrith]], and other English all followed these Irish traditions.\n\n==Other British and Irish traditions==\nA number of other distinctive traditions and practices existed (or are taken to have existed) in Britain or Ireland, but are not known to have been in use across the entire region. Different writers and commenters have identified different traditions as representative of so-called Celtic Christianity.<ref>This list includes information from {{cite book |first=Charles |last=Plummer |chapter=Excursus on the Paschal Controversy and Tonsure |title=Venerablilis Baedae, Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |orig-year=1892 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1975 |pages=348\u2013354 }}</ref>\n\n===Monasticism===\n[[Image:National Library of Ireland MS G10 p24.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from the [[Martyrology of Oengus]]]]\nMonastic spirituality came to Britain and then Ireland from Gaul, by way of L\u00e9rins, Tours, and Auxerre. Its spirituality was heavily influenced by the [[Desert Fathers]]. According to Richard Woods, the familial, democratic, and decentralized aspects of Egyptian Christianity were better suited to structures and values of Celtic culture than was a legalistic diocesan form.<ref name=woods/> Monasteries tended to be cenobitical in that monks lived in separate cells but came together for common prayer, meals, and other functions. Some more austere ascetics became hermits living in remote locations in what came to be called the \"green martyrdom\".<ref name=woods/> An example of this would be [[Kevin of Glendalough]] and [[Cuthbert]] of [[Lindisfarne]].\n\nOne outdated belief is that that the true ecclesiastical power in the Celtic world lay in the hands of [[abbots]] of [[monasteries]], rather than bishops of [[dioceses]].<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433>{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=433}}</ref> It is certain that the ideal of monasticism was universally esteemed in Celtic Christianity.<ref name=Herren13>{{harvnb|Herren|Brown|2002|p=13}}</ref> This was especially true in Ireland and areas evangelised by Irish missionaries, where monasteries and their abbots came to be vested with a great deal of ecclesiastical and secular power. Following the growth of the monastic movement in the 6th century, abbots controlled not only individual monasteries, but also expansive estates and the secular communities that tended them.<ref name=Hughes311312>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=311\u2013312}}</ref> As monastics, abbots were not necessarily [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|ordained]] (i.e. they were not necessarily [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or bishops). They were usually descended from one of the many Irish royal families, and the founding regulations of the abbey sometimes specified that the abbotcy should if possible be kept within one family lineage.<ref>[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, D\u00e1ibh\u00ed]] in {{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nThis focus on the monastery has led some scholars, most notably [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)|Kathleen Hughes]], to argue that the monastic system came to be the dominant ecclesiastical structure in the Irish church, essentially replacing the earlier [[Episcopal polity|episcopal structure]] of the type found in most of the rest of the Christian world.<ref name=Hughes311>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=311 and note }}</ref> Hughes argued that the ''paruchia'', or network of monasteries attached to an [[abbey]], replaced the diocese as the chief administrative unit of the church, and the position of Abbot largely replaced that of bishop in authority and prominence.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=312}}</ref> According to this model, bishops were still needed, since certain [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacramental]] functions were reserved only for the ordained, but they had little authority in the ecclesiastical structure.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nHowever, more recent scholarship, particularly the work of [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] and [[Richard Sharpe (historian)|Richard Sharpe]], has offered a more nuanced view of the interrelationships between the monastic system and the traditional Church structures.<ref name=Hughes311/> Sharpe argues that there is no evidence that the ''paruchia'' overrode the diocese, or that the abbot replaced the Bishop;<ref name=Herren13/> Bishops still exercised ultimate spiritual authority and remained in charge of the diocesan clergy.<ref name=Hughes311/> But either way, the monastic ideal was regarded as the utmost expression of the Christian life.<ref name=Herren13/>\n\nThe focus on powerful abbots and monasteries was limited to the Irish Church, however, and not in Britain. The British church employed an episcopal structure corresponding closely to the model used elsewhere in the Christian world.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\nIrish monasticism was notable for its permeability. In permeable monasticism, people were able to move freely in and out of the monastic system at different points of life. Young boys and girls would enter the system to pursue Latin scholarship.  Students would sometimes travel from faraway lands to enter the Irish monasteries. When these students became adults, they would leave the monastery to live out their lives. Eventually, these people would retire back to secure community provided by the monastery and stay until their death. However, some would stay within the monastery and become leaders. Since most of the clergy were Irish, native traditions were well-respected. Permeable monasticism popularised the use of vernacular and helped mesh the norms of secular and monastic element in Ireland, unlike other parts of Europe where monasteries were more isolated. Examples of these intertwining motifs can be seen in the hagiographies of [[St. Brigid]] and [[St. Columba]].<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\">{{cite book|last1=de Paor|first1=M\u00e1ire|last2=de Paor|author1link=M\u00e1ire de Paor|first2=Liam|title=Early Christian Ireland: Ancient Peoples and Places|year=1958|publisher=Frederick A. Praeger}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThis willingness to learn, and also to teach, was a hallmark of the \"permeable monasticism\" that so characterised the Irish monastery. While a hermitage was still the highest form of dedication, the monasteries were very open to allowing students and children within the walls for an education, without requiring them to become monks. These students were then allowed to leave and live within the community, and were welcomed back in their old age to retire in peace. This style of monasticism allowed for the monastery to connect with, and become a part of, the community at large. The availability of the monks to the people was instrumental in converting Ireland from paganism to Christianity, allowing a blend of the two cultures.<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Wales====\n{{main article|Clas (ecclesiastical settlement)}}\nAccording to [[hagiography|hagiographies]] written some centuries later, [[Illtud]] and his pupils [[Saint David|David]], Gildas, and [[Deiniol]] were leading figures in 6th-century Britain.\n\nNot far from Llantwit Fawr stood [[Cadoc]]'s foundation of [[Llancarfan]], founded in the latter part of the fifth century. The son of [[Gwynllyw]], a prince of South Wales, who before his death renounced the world to lead an eremitical life. Cadoc followed his father's example and received the religious habit from St. Tathai, an Irish monk, superior of a small community at Swent near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a church and monastery, which was called Llancarfan, or the \"Church of the Stags\". Here he established a monastery, college and hospital. The spot at first seemed an impossible one, and an almost inaccessible marsh, but he and his monks drained and cultivated it, transforming it into one of the most famous religious houses in South Wales.<ref name=Chandlery>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15585a.htm |last=Chandlery |first=Peter |title=Welsh Monastic Foundations |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=15 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |date=1912 |access-date=18 December 2015 }}</ref> His legend recounts that he daily fed a hundred clergy and a hundred soldiers, a hundred workmen, a hundred poor men, and the same number of widows.

It was well placed to be a centre of Insular Christianity. When [[Alfred the Great]] sought a scholar for his court, he summoned [[Asser]] of Saint David's. Contemporary with David were [[Saint Teilo]], Cadoc, [[Padarn]], [[Beuno]] and [[Tysilio]] among them. It was from Illtud and his successors that the Irish sought guidance on matters of ritual and discipline. [[Finnian of Clonard]] studied under Cadoc at [[Llancarfan]] in [[Glamorgan]].\n\n====Ireland====\n[[Finnian of Clonard]] is said to have trained the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]] at [[Clonard Abbey]]. \n[[File:BookMullingFol193StJohnPortrait.jpg|thumb|[[John the Evangelist|Saint John]], [[evangelist portrait]] from the [[Book of Mulling]], Irish, late 8th century]]\nThe achievements of [[insular art]], in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], [[high cross]]es, and metalwork like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] remain very well known, and in the case of manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art.<ref>{{harvnb|Nordenfalk|1977}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}; {{harvnb|P\u00e4cht|1986}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The manuscripts were certainly produced by and for monasteries, and the evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops, perhaps as well as secular commercial ones.<ref>{{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=15\u201316, 125}}</ref>\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, Irish monks established monastic institutions in parts of modern-day Scotland (especially [[Columba]], also known as ''Colmcille'' or, in [[Old Irish]], ''Colum Cille''), and on the [[Continental Europe|continent]], particularly in Gaul (especially [[Columbanus]]). Monks from [[Iona Abbey|Iona]] under [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|St. Aidan]] founded the See of [[Lindisfarne]] in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Northumbria]] in 635, whence Gaelic-Irish practice heavily influenced northern England.\n\nIrish monks also founded monasteries across the continent, exerting influence greater than many more ancient continental centres.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=36}}</ref> The first issuance of a papal privilege granting a monastery freedom from episcopal oversight was that of Pope Honorius I to [[Bobbio Abbey]], one of Columbanus's institutions.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=37}}</ref>\n\nAt least in Ireland, the monastic system became increasingly secularised from the 8th century, as close ties between ruling families and monasteries became apparent. The major monasteries were now wealthy in land and had political importance. On occasion they made war either upon each other or took part in secular wars \u2013 a battle in 764 is supposed to have killed 200 from [[Durrow Abbey]] when they were defeated by [[Clonmacnoise]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=317}}</ref> From early periods the kin nature of many monasteries had meant that some married men were part of the community, supplying labour and with some rights, including in the election of abbots (but obliged to abstain from sex during fasting periods). Some abbacies passed from father to son, and then even grandsons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=313, 316, 319}}</ref> A revival of the [[ascetic]] tradition came in the second half of the century, with the [[culdee]] or \"clients ([[vassal]]s) of God\" movement founding new monasteries detached from family groupings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\n===Rule of Columbanus===\nThe monasteries of the Irish missions, and many at home, adopted the Rule of Saint [[Columbanus]], which was stricter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the main alternative in the West.  In particular there was more [[fasting]] and an emphasis on [[corporal punishment]]. For some generations monks trained by Irish missionaries continued to use the Rule and to found new monasteries using it, but most converted to the Benedictine Rule over the 8th and 9th centuries.{{efn|The main source for Columbanus's life or vita is recorded by [[Jonas of Bobbio]], an Italian monk who entered the monastery in Bobbio in 618, three years after the Saint's death; Jonas wrote the life c. 643. This author lived during the abbacy of Attala, Columbanus's immediate successor, and his informants had been companions of the saint. Mabillon in the second volume of his \"Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.\" gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.}}\n\nAgain, however, the Rule of Columbanus was used exclusively in monasteries in the Irish sphere of influence; it was not followed in British monasteries.\n\n===Baptism===\nBede implies that in the time of Augustine of Canterbury, British churches used a baptismal rite that was in some way at variance with the Roman practice. According to Bede, the British Christians' failure to \"complete\" the sacrament of baptism was one of the three specific issues with British practice that Augustine could not overlook.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|p=175}}</ref> There is no indication as to how the baptism was \"incomplete\" according to the Roman custom. It may be that there was some difference in the [[confirmation]] rite, or that there was no confirmation at all.<ref name=Lloyd177/> At any rate, it is unlikely to have caused as much discord as the Easter controversy or the tonsure, as no other source mentions it.<ref name=Lloyd177/> As such there is no evidence that heterodox baptism figured into the practice of the Irish church.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\n===Accusations of Judaizing===\nA recurrent accusation levelled against the Irish throughout the Middle Ages is that they were [[Judaizers]], which is to say that they observed certain religious rites after the manner of the Jews.<ref name=\"flech\"/> The belief that Irish Christians were Judaizers can be observed in three main areas: the Easter Controversy, the notion that the Irish practiced obsolete laws from the [[Old Testament]] and (not unrelated to this) the view that they adhered too closely to the Old Testament. Quite apart from the intricate theological concerns that underpinned the debate over Easter in early 7th-century Gaul, Columbanus also found himself accused of [[Quartodecimanism]], a heresy whose central tenet was observing Easter on the same date as the eve of the Jewish [[Passover]], namely the fourteenth day of the Jewish lunar month of [[Nisan]]. Although this false accusation was raised at a time of heightened political tensions between Columbanus and the Gallic bishops, some historians have cautioned that it ought not be dismissed as a mere ruse because the Gauls may have been genuinely worried about blurring the boundaries between Gallic Christians and their Jewish neighbours.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancliffe|1992|pp=211\u201312}}</ref> That the Irish practiced obsolete Old Testament laws is another accusation that repeats itself a number of times in the early Middle Ages, most famously in the case of the 8th-century Irish charismatic preacher, [[Clement Scotus I]] (fl. 745), who was condemned as a heretic, in part for urging followers to follow Old Testament law in such controversial matters as obliging a man to marry his widowed sister-in-law upon his brother's death.<ref name=\"Meeder\">{{harvnb|Meeder|2011|pp=251\u201380}}</ref> Finally, a good example for the Irish tendency to adhere closely to the Old Testament is the [[Collectio canonum Hibernensis|''Hibernensis'']], a late 7th- or early 8th-century Irish canon law collection which was the first text of church law to draw heavily on the Bible, and in particular the Old Testament, at a time when Christians were meant to be \"dead to the old law\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+7%3A4&version=NIV Romans 7:4]). In Scotland similar accusations surround the supposed [[Scottish pork taboo|cultural taboo concerning pork]].\n\n==Celtic Christian revivalism==\n{{See also|Neo-Celtic Christianity}}\n[[Ian Bradley]] notes that the recurrent interest in medieval insular Christianity has led to successive [[revival movement]]s he terms \"Celtic Christian revivalism\". According to Bradley, most, though not all, revivalists are non-Celts for whom Celtic Christianity has an \"exotic and peripheral\" appeal.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|pp=viii\u2013ix}}</ref> Adherents typically claim their revivals restore authentic practices and traits, though Bradley notes they reflect contemporary concerns and prejudices much more closely, and most are \"at least partially inspired and driven by denominational and national rivalries, ecclesiastical and secular power politics, and an anti-Roman Catholic agenda.\" Though often inaccurate or distorted, the beliefs of these movements have greatly influenced popular conceptions of historical Celtic Christianity.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=ix}}</ref>\n\nBradley traces the origins of Celtic Christian revivalism to the Middle Ages. In the 8th and 9th century, authors wrote idealised [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of earlier saints, whose \"golden age\" of extraordinary holiness contrasted with the perceived corruption of later times. Similarly, the 12th- and 13th-century [[Renaissance of the 12th century|literary revival]] popularised and romanticised older Celtic traditions such as the [[Arthurian legend]].

[[Protestant]] writers of this time popularised the idea of an indigenous British Christianity that opposed the foreign \"Roman\" church and was purer (and [[proto-Protestant]]) in thought. The English church, they claimed, was not forming a new institution, but casting off the shackles of Rome and returning to its true roots as the indigenous national church of Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 2}}</ref>\n*  The [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] of the 18th century, in particular Romantic notions of the [[noble savage]] and the intrinsic qualities of the \"Celtic race\", further influenced ideas about Celtic Christianity. Romantics idealised the Celts as a primitive, bucolic people who were far more poetic, spiritual, and freer of [[rationalism]] than their neighbours. The Celts were seen as having an inner spiritual nature that shone through even after their form of Christianity had been destroyed by the authoritarian and rational Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|pp= 2\u20133}}</ref>\n* In the 20th and 21st centuries, ideas about \"Celtic Christians\" combined with appeals by certain modern churches, [[Modern Paganism |modern pagan]] groups, and [[New Age]] groups seeking to recover something of ancient spirituality that they believe is missing from the modern world. For these groups, Celtic Christianity becomes a cipher for whatever is lost in the modern religious experience. Corning notes that these notions say more about modern desires than about the reality of Christianity in the Early Middle Ages.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p= 3}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to associate the early Christians of Celtic-speaking [[Galatia]] (purportedly recipients of [[Paul the Apostle | Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians]]) with later Christians of north-western Europe's [[Celtic fringe]] appear fanciful.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Boyle\n| first1 = Elizabeth\n| author-link1 = \n| chapter = Writing Medieval Irish History in the Nineteenth Century \n| editor1-last = Hill\n| editor1-first = Jacqueline\n| editor2-last = Lyons\n| editor2-first = Mary Ann\n| title = Representing Irish Religious Histories: Historiography, Ideology and Practice\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a5XlDQAAQBAJ\n| series = Histories of the Sacred and Secular, 1700-2000\n| location = Cham, Switzerland\n| publisher = Springer\n| date = 2017\n| page = 72\n| isbn = 9783319415314\n| access-date = 4 February 2018\n| quote = '[...] a Celtic Christianity, with its peculiar national faults and characteristics, finds place even in the New Testament.

The [[tonsure]] differed from that elsewhere and also became a point of contention.

Gregory intended for Augustine to become the [[metropolitan bishop]] over all of southern Britain, including the existing dioceses under Welsh and Cornish control. Augustine met with British bishops in a series of conferences \u2013 known as the [[Synod of Chester]] \u2013 that attempted to assert his authority and to compel them to abandon aspects of their service that had fallen out of line with Roman practice. The [[Northumbria]]n cleric [[Bede]]'s ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' is the only surviving account of these meetings: according to it, some of the clerics of the nearest British province met Augustine at a site on the border of the [[Kingdom of Kent]] that was known thereafter as Augustine's Oak. Augustine focused on seeking assistance for his work among the Saxons and reforming the Britons' [[Easter controversy|obsolete method for calculating Easter]]; the clerics responded that they would need to confer with their people and await a larger assembly.<ref name=Lloyd174175>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref> Bede relates that the bishops particularly consulted a hermit on how to respond. He told them to respond based on Augustine's conduct: were he to rise to greet them, they would know him for a humble servant of Christ and should submit to his authority but, were he to remain seated, they would know him to be arrogant and prideful and should reject him. As it happened, Augustine did keep his seat, provoking outrage. In the negotiations that followed, he offered to allow the Britons to maintain all their native customs but three: they should adopt Rome's more advanced method of calculating the date of Easter, reform their baptismal ritual, and join the missionary efforts among the Saxons. The British clerics rejected all of these, as well as Augustine's authority over them.<ref name=Lloyd174175/> [[John Edward Lloyd]] argues that the primary reason for the British bishops' rejection of Augustine \u2013 and especially his call for them to join his missionary effort \u2013 was his claim to sovereignty over them, given that his see would be so deeply entwined with Anglo-Saxon Kent.<ref name=Lloyd177>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe death of hundreds of British clerics to the pagan king [[\u00c6thelfrith]] of the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] around 616 at the [[Battle of Chester]] was taken by [[Bede]] as fulfillment of a prophecy allegedly made by [[Augustine of Hippo]] that the British church would receive war and death from the Saxons they refused to proselytise.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|p=180}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|pp=118\u2013119}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Bede |title=Ecclesiastical History of England |location=London |publisher=George Bell and Sons |date=1907 |url=https://archive.org/details/forestculturean01coopgoog |via=Internet Archive }}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2017}}{{efn|Bede says 1,200 British clergy died; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' says 200.

It was not until the death of [[Bishop of St Davids|Bishop]] [[Bernard (bishop of St Davids)|Bernard]] ({{circa|lk=no|1147}}) that St&nbsp;Davids finally abandoned its claims to metropolitan status and submitted to the [[Province of Canterbury]], by which point the popularity of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudohistorical ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' had begun spreading these inventions further afield.

The less exact [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise \"[[De ratione Paschae|On the measurement of Easter]]\", which includes an 84-year cycle based on [[Metonic cycle|Meton]]. This was introduced to Britain, whose clerics at some point modified it to use the [[Julian calendar]]'s original equinox on 25 March instead of the Nicaean equinox, which had already drifted to 21 March. This calendar was conserved by the Britons and Irish<ref>{{harvnb|Wormald|2006|p=224 n. 1}}</ref> while the Romans and French began to use the [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorian]] cycle of 532 years. The Romans (but not the French) then adopted the still-better work of [[Dionysius Exiguus|Dionysius]] in 525, which brought them into harmony with the [[Church of Alexandria]].\n\nIn the early 600s Christians in Ireland and Britain became aware of the divergence in dating between them and those in Europe. The first clash came in 602 when a synod of French bishops opposed the practices of the monasteries established by [[Columbanus|St&nbsp;Columbanus]]; Columbanus appealed to [[Pope Gregory I|the pope]] but received no answer and finally moved from their jurisdiction. It was a primary concern for [[Augustine of Canterbury|St&nbsp;Augustine]] and [[Gregorian mission|his mission]], although [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]]'s flight to [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and eventual restoration to his throne meant that Celtic practice was introduced to [[Northumbria]] until the 664 [[Synod of Whitby|synod in Whitby]]. The groups furthest away from the [[Gregorian mission]] were generally the readiest to acknowledge the superiority of the new tables: the bishops of southern Ireland adopted the continental system at the [[Synod of Mag L\u00e9ne]] ({{circa|lk=no|630}}); the {{circa|lk=no|697}} [[Council of Birr]] saw the northern Irish bishops follow suit.

Penitents were divided into a separate part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to Mass wearing [[sackcloth]] and ashes in a process known as ''exomologesis'' that often involved some form of general confession.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=7\u20139}}</ref> There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (''sacerdos''), and it seems that, for some sins, private penance was allowed instead.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=9\u201312}}</ref> Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included [[absolution]] at its conclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Gamer|1938|pp=13\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe Irish penitential practice spread throughout the continent, where the form of public penance had fallen into disuse. Saint [[Columbanus]] was credited with introducing the ''medicamenta paentitentiae'', the \"medicines of penance\", to Gaul at a time when they had come to be neglected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2003|p=252}}</ref> Though the process met some resistance, by 1215 the practice had become established as the norm, with the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] establishing a canonical statute requiring confession at a minimum of once per year.\n\n===Peregrinatio===\nA final distinctive tradition common across Britain and Ireland was the popularity of ''peregrinatio pro Christo'' (\"exile for Christ\"). The term ''peregrinatio'' is [[Latin]], and referred to the state of living or sojourning away from one's homeland in [[Roman law]]. It was later used by the [[Church Fathers]], in particular Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who wrote that Christians should live a life of ''peregrinatio'' in the present world while awaiting the [[Kingdom of God]]. Augustine's version of ''peregrinatio'' spread widely throughout the Christian church, but it took two additional unique meanings in Celtic countries.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn the first sense, the penitentials prescribed permanent or temporary ''peregrinatio'' as penance for certain infractions. Additionally, there was a tradition of undertaking a voluntary ''peregrinatio pro Christo'', in which individuals permanently left their homes and put themselves entirely in God's hands. In the Irish tradition there were two types of such ''peregrinatio'', the \"lesser\" peregrinatio, involving leaving one's home area but not the island, and the \"superior\" peregrinatio, which meant leaving Ireland for good. This voluntary exile to spend one's life in a foreign land far from friends and family came to be termed the \"white martyrdom\".<ref name=woods>{{cite journal |url=http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |last=Woods |first=Richard |title=The Spirituality of the Celtic Church |journal=Spirituality Today |date=Fall 1985 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=243\u2013255 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103040938/http://www.spiritualitytoday.org/spir2day/853735woods.html#3 |archive-date=3 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMost ''peregrini'' or exiles of this type were seeking personal spiritual fulfilment, but many became involved in missionary endeavours. The Briton [[Saint Patrick]] became the evangelist of Ireland during what he called his ''peregrinatio'' there, while [[Samson of Dol|Saint Samson]] left his home to ultimately become bishop in [[Brittany]]. The Irishmen [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]] similarly founded highly important religious communities after leaving their homes.<ref name=Corningperegrinatio/> Irish-educated English Christians such as [[Gerald of Mayo]], the [[Two Ewalds]], [[Willehad]], [[Willibrord]], [[Wilfrid]], [[Ceolfrith]], and other English all followed these Irish traditions.\n\n==Other British and Irish traditions==\nA number of other distinctive traditions and practices existed (or are taken to have existed) in Britain or Ireland, but are not known to have been in use across the entire region. Different writers and commenters have identified different traditions as representative of so-called Celtic Christianity.<ref>This list includes information from {{cite book |first=Charles |last=Plummer |chapter=Excursus on the Paschal Controversy and Tonsure |title=Venerablilis Baedae, Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Plummer |orig-year=1892 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1975 |pages=348\u2013354 }}</ref>\n\n===Monasticism===\n[[Image:National Library of Ireland MS G10 p24.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from the [[Martyrology of Oengus]]]]\nMonastic spirituality came to Britain and then Ireland from Gaul, by way of L\u00e9rins, Tours, and Auxerre. Its spirituality was heavily influenced by the [[Desert Fathers]]. According to Richard Woods, the familial, democratic, and decentralized aspects of Egyptian Christianity were better suited to structures and values of Celtic culture than was a legalistic diocesan form.<ref name=woods/> Monasteries tended to be cenobitical in that monks lived in separate cells but came together for common prayer, meals, and other functions. Some more austere ascetics became hermits living in remote locations in what came to be called the \"green martyrdom\".<ref name=woods/> An example of this would be [[Kevin of Glendalough]] and [[Cuthbert]] of [[Lindisfarne]].\n\nOne outdated belief is that that the true ecclesiastical power in the Celtic world lay in the hands of [[abbots]] of [[monasteries]], rather than bishops of [[dioceses]].<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433>{{harvnb|Koch|2006|p=433}}</ref> It is certain that the ideal of monasticism was universally esteemed in Celtic Christianity.<ref name=Herren13>{{harvnb|Herren|Brown|2002|p=13}}</ref> This was especially true in Ireland and areas evangelised by Irish missionaries, where monasteries and their abbots came to be vested with a great deal of ecclesiastical and secular power. Following the growth of the monastic movement in the 6th century, abbots controlled not only individual monasteries, but also expansive estates and the secular communities that tended them.<ref name=Hughes311312>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=311\u2013312}}</ref> As monastics, abbots were not necessarily [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|ordained]] (i.e. they were not necessarily [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or bishops). They were usually descended from one of the many Irish royal families, and the founding regulations of the abbey sometimes specified that the abbotcy should if possible be kept within one family lineage.<ref>[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn|\u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, D\u00e1ibh\u00ed]] in {{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nThis focus on the monastery has led some scholars, most notably [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)|Kathleen Hughes]], to argue that the monastic system came to be the dominant ecclesiastical structure in the Irish church, essentially replacing the earlier [[Episcopal polity|episcopal structure]] of the type found in most of the rest of the Christian world.<ref name=Hughes311>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=311 and note }}</ref> Hughes argued that the ''paruchia'', or network of monasteries attached to an [[abbey]], replaced the diocese as the chief administrative unit of the church, and the position of Abbot largely replaced that of bishop in authority and prominence.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=312}}</ref> According to this model, bishops were still needed, since certain [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacramental]] functions were reserved only for the ordained, but they had little authority in the ecclesiastical structure.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|pp=32\u201334}}</ref>\n\nHowever, more recent scholarship, particularly the work of [[Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in]] and [[Richard Sharpe (historian)|Richard Sharpe]], has offered a more nuanced view of the interrelationships between the monastic system and the traditional Church structures.<ref name=Hughes311/> Sharpe argues that there is no evidence that the ''paruchia'' overrode the diocese, or that the abbot replaced the Bishop;<ref name=Herren13/> Bishops still exercised ultimate spiritual authority and remained in charge of the diocesan clergy.<ref name=Hughes311/> But either way, the monastic ideal was regarded as the utmost expression of the Christian life.<ref name=Herren13/>\n\nThe focus on powerful abbots and monasteries was limited to the Irish Church, however, and not in Britain. The British church employed an episcopal structure corresponding closely to the model used elsewhere in the Christian world.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\nIrish monasticism was notable for its permeability. In permeable monasticism, people were able to move freely in and out of the monastic system at different points of life. Young boys and girls would enter the system to pursue Latin scholarship.  Students would sometimes travel from faraway lands to enter the Irish monasteries. When these students became adults, they would leave the monastery to live out their lives. Eventually, these people would retire back to secure community provided by the monastery and stay until their death. However, some would stay within the monastery and become leaders. Since most of the clergy were Irish, native traditions were well-respected. Permeable monasticism popularised the use of vernacular and helped mesh the norms of secular and monastic element in Ireland, unlike other parts of Europe where monasteries were more isolated. Examples of these intertwining motifs can be seen in the hagiographies of [[St. Brigid]] and [[St. Columba]].<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\">{{cite book|last1=de Paor|first1=M\u00e1ire|last2=de Paor|author1link=M\u00e1ire de Paor|first2=Liam|title=Early Christian Ireland: Ancient Peoples and Places|year=1958|publisher=Frederick A. Praeger}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThis willingness to learn, and also to teach, was a hallmark of the \"permeable monasticism\" that so characterised the Irish monastery. While a hermitage was still the highest form of dedication, the monasteries were very open to allowing students and children within the walls for an education, without requiring them to become monks. These students were then allowed to leave and live within the community, and were welcomed back in their old age to retire in peace. This style of monasticism allowed for the monastery to connect with, and become a part of, the community at large. The availability of the monks to the people was instrumental in converting Ireland from paganism to Christianity, allowing a blend of the two cultures.<ref name=\"de Paor 1958\"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n====Wales====\n{{main article|Clas (ecclesiastical settlement)}}\nAccording to [[hagiography|hagiographies]] written some centuries later, [[Illtud]] and his pupils [[Saint David|David]], Gildas, and [[Deiniol]] were leading figures in 6th-century Britain.\n\nNot far from Llantwit Fawr stood [[Cadoc]]'s foundation of [[Llancarfan]], founded in the latter part of the fifth century. The son of [[Gwynllyw]], a prince of South Wales, who before his death renounced the world to lead an eremitical life. Cadoc followed his father's example and received the religious habit from St. Tathai, an Irish monk, superior of a small community at Swent near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a church and monastery, which was called Llancarfan, or the \"Church of the Stags\". Here he established a monastery, college and hospital. The spot at first seemed an impossible one, and an almost inaccessible marsh, but he and his monks drained and cultivated it, transforming it into one of the most famous religious houses in South Wales.<ref name=Chandlery>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15585a.htm |last=Chandlery |first=Peter |title=Welsh Monastic Foundations |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |volume=15 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |date=1912 |access-date=18 December 2015 }}</ref> His legend recounts that he daily fed a hundred clergy and a hundred soldiers, a hundred workmen, a hundred poor men, and the same number of widows. When thousands left the world and became monks, they very often did so as clansmen, dutifully following the example of their chief.

It was well placed to be a centre of Insular Christianity. When [[Alfred the Great]] sought a scholar for his court, he summoned [[Asser]] of Saint David's. Contemporary with David were [[Saint Teilo]], Cadoc, [[Padarn]], [[Beuno]] and [[Tysilio]] among them. It was from Illtud and his successors that the Irish sought guidance on matters of ritual and discipline. [[Finnian of Clonard]] studied under Cadoc at [[Llancarfan]] in [[Glamorgan]].\n\n====Ireland====\n[[Finnian of Clonard]] is said to have trained the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]] at [[Clonard Abbey]]. \n[[File:BookMullingFol193StJohnPortrait.jpg|thumb|[[John the Evangelist|Saint John]], [[evangelist portrait]] from the [[Book of Mulling]], Irish, late 8th century]]\nThe achievements of [[insular art]], in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], [[high cross]]es, and metalwork like the [[Ardagh Chalice]] remain very well known, and in the case of manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art.<ref>{{harvnb|Nordenfalk|1977}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}; {{harvnb|P\u00e4cht|1986}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The manuscripts were certainly produced by and for monasteries, and the evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops, perhaps as well as secular commercial ones.<ref>{{harvnb|Youngs|1989|pp=15\u201316, 125}}</ref>\n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, Irish monks established monastic institutions in parts of modern-day Scotland (especially [[Columba]], also known as ''Colmcille'' or, in [[Old Irish]], ''Colum Cille''), and on the [[Continental Europe|continent]], particularly in Gaul (especially [[Columbanus]]). Monks from [[Iona Abbey|Iona]] under [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|St. Aidan]] founded the See of [[Lindisfarne]] in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Northumbria]] in 635, whence Gaelic-Irish practice heavily influenced northern England.\n\nIrish monks also founded monasteries across the continent, exerting influence greater than many more ancient continental centres.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=36}}</ref> The first issuance of a papal privilege granting a monastery freedom from episcopal oversight was that of Pope Honorius I to [[Bobbio Abbey]], one of Columbanus's institutions.<ref>{{harvnb|John|2000|p=37}}</ref>\n\nAt least in Ireland, the monastic system became increasingly secularised from the 8th century, as close ties between ruling families and monasteries became apparent. The major monasteries were now wealthy in land and had political importance. On occasion they made war either upon each other or took part in secular wars \u2013 a battle in 764 is supposed to have killed 200 from [[Durrow Abbey]] when they were defeated by [[Clonmacnoise]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=317}}</ref> From early periods the kin nature of many monasteries had meant that some married men were part of the community, supplying labour and with some rights, including in the election of abbots (but obliged to abstain from sex during fasting periods). Some abbacies passed from father to son, and then even grandsons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=313, 316, 319}}</ref> A revival of the [[ascetic]] tradition came in the second half of the century, with the [[culdee]] or \"clients ([[vassal]]s) of God\" movement founding new monasteries detached from family groupings.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=319\u2013320}}</ref>\n\n===Rule of Columbanus===\nThe monasteries of the Irish missions, and many at home, adopted the Rule of Saint [[Columbanus]], which was stricter than the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], the main alternative in the West.  In particular there was more [[fasting]] and an emphasis on [[corporal punishment]]. For some generations monks trained by Irish missionaries continued to use the Rule and to found new monasteries using it, but most converted to the Benedictine Rule over the 8th and 9th centuries.{{efn|The main source for Columbanus's life or vita is recorded by [[Jonas of Bobbio]], an Italian monk who entered the monastery in Bobbio in 618, three years after the Saint's death; Jonas wrote the life c. 643. This author lived during the abbacy of Attala, Columbanus's immediate successor, and his informants had been companions of the saint. Mabillon in the second volume of his \"Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.\" gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.}}\n\nAgain, however, the Rule of Columbanus was used exclusively in monasteries in the Irish sphere of influence; it was not followed in British monasteries.\n\n===Baptism===\nBede implies that in the time of Augustine of Canterbury, British churches used a baptismal rite that was in some way at variance with the Roman practice. According to Bede, the British Christians' failure to \"complete\" the sacrament of baptism was one of the three specific issues with British practice that Augustine could not overlook.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1912|p=175}}</ref> There is no indication as to how the baptism was \"incomplete\" according to the Roman custom. It may be that there was some difference in the [[confirmation]] rite, or that there was no confirmation at all.<ref name=Lloyd177/> At any rate, it is unlikely to have caused as much discord as the Easter controversy or the tonsure, as no other source mentions it.<ref name=Lloyd177/> As such there is no evidence that heterodox baptism figured into the practice of the Irish church.<ref name=Corning1/><ref name=Koch433/>\n\n===Accusations of Judaizing===\nA recurrent accusation levelled against the Irish throughout the Middle Ages is that they were [[Judaizers]], which is to say that they observed certain religious rites after the manner of the Jews.<ref name=\"flech\"/> The belief that Irish Christians were Judaizers can be observed in three main areas: the Easter Controversy, the notion that the Irish practiced obsolete laws from the [[Old Testament]] and (not unrelated to this) the view that they adhered too closely to the Old Testament. Quite apart from the intricate theological concerns that underpinned the debate over Easter in early 7th-century Gaul, Columbanus also found himself accused of [[Quartodecimanism]], a heresy whose central tenet was observing Easter on the same date as the eve of the Jewish [[Passover]], namely the fourteenth day of the Jewish lunar month of [[Nisan]]. Although this false accusation was raised at a time of heightened political tensions between Columbanus and the Gallic bishops, some historians have cautioned that it ought not be dismissed as a mere ruse because the Gauls may have been genuinely worried about blurring the boundaries between Gallic Christians and their Jewish neighbours.<ref>{{harvnb|Stancliffe|1992|pp=211\u201312}}</ref> That the Irish practiced obsolete Old Testament laws is another accusation that repeats itself a number of times in the early Middle Ages, most famously in the case of the 8th-century Irish charismatic preacher, [[Clement Scotus I]] (fl. 745), who was condemned as a heretic, in part for urging followers to follow Old Testament law in such controversial matters as obliging a man to marry his widowed sister-in-law upon his brother's death.<ref name=\"Meeder\">{{harvnb|Meeder|2011|pp=251\u201380}}</ref> Finally, a good example for the Irish tendency to adhere closely to the Old Testament is the [[Collectio canonum Hibernensis|''Hibernensis'']], a late 7th- or early 8th-century Irish canon law collection which was the first text of church law to draw heavily on the Bible, and in particular the Old Testament, at a time when Christians were meant to be \"dead to the old law\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+7%3A4&version=NIV Romans 7:4]). In Scotland similar accusations surround the supposed [[Scottish pork taboo|cultural taboo concerning pork]].\n\n==Celtic Christian revivalism==\n{{See also|Neo-Celtic Christianity}}\n[[Ian Bradley]] notes that the recurrent interest in medieval insular Christianity has led to successive [[revival movement]]s he terms \"Celtic Christian revivalism\". According to Bradley, most, though not all, revivalists are non-Celts for whom Celtic Christianity has an \"exotic and peripheral\" appeal.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|pp=viii\u2013ix}}</ref> Adherents typically claim their revivals restore authentic practices and traits, though Bradley notes they reflect contemporary concerns and prejudices much more closely, and most are \"at least partially inspired and driven by denominational and national rivalries, ecclesiastical and secular power politics, and an anti-Roman Catholic agenda.\" Though often inaccurate or distorted, the beliefs of these movements have greatly influenced popular conceptions of historical Celtic Christianity.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=ix}}</ref>\n\nBradley traces the origins of Celtic Christian revivalism to the Middle Ages. In the 8th and 9th century, authors wrote idealised [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of earlier saints, whose \"golden age\" of extraordinary holiness contrasted with the perceived corruption of later times. Similarly, the 12th- and 13th-century [[Renaissance of the 12th century|literary revival]] popularised and romanticised older Celtic traditions such as the [[Arthurian legend]]. These ideas were expanded during the [[English Reformation]], as Protestant authors appropriated the concept of a \"Celtic Church\" as a native, anti-Roman predecessor to their own movement.<ref name=Bradleyviii>{{harvnb|Bradley|1999|p=viii}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, [[antiquarian]]ism, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement, and growing nationalism influenced ideas about what was becoming known as \"Celtic Christianity\". Beginning in the early 20th century, a full-fledged revival movement began, centred on the island of [[Iona]] and influenced by the [[Irish Literary Revival]] and more general Christian revivals.
