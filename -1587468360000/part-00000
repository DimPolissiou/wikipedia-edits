Transportation of the phosphate to the port of Casablanca also started in 1921, allowing the first export of phosphate that year. Subsequently, OCP launched other mining sites in Youssoufia in 1931 and in Benguerir in 1976, and launched chemical production in Safi in 1965 and in Jorf Lasfar in 1984. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1962/06/A/24781|title=L'Office ch\u00e9rifien des phosphates amorce une nouvelle phase d'expansion|date=1962-06-01|website=Le Monde diplomatique|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Ownership ===\nIn 2008, the OCP Group became a limited company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/MA/Office_Chrifien_des_Phosphates_Group__OCP___%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%84%C3%99%C2%85%C3%98%C2%AC%C3%99%C2%85%C3%98%C2%B9_%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%99%C2%84%C3%98%C2%B4%C3%98%C2%B1%C3%99%C2%8A%C3%99%C2%81_%C3%99%C2%84%C3%99%C2%84%C3%99%C2%81%C3%99%C2%88%C3%98%C2%B3%C3%99%C2%81%C3%98%C2%A7%C3%98%C2%B7__en_3853612.html|title=Office Chrifien des Phosphates Group (OCP) Company Profile - Morocco {{!}} Financials & Key Executives {{!}} EMIS|website=www.emis.com|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.le360.ma/economie/ocp-group-reduit-sa-participation-dans-la-bcp-29317|title=OCP Group r\u00e9duit sa participation dans la BCP|website=fr.le360.ma|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Currently 95% of the OCP Group is owned by the Moroccan state and 5% by Banque Centrale Populaire investment funds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/monde/afrique/maroc-le-nouvel-age-d-or-des-phosphates_1072371.html|title=Maroc: le nouvel \u00e2ge d'or des phosphates|date=2012-01-17|website=LExpress.fr|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fr.le360.ma/economie/ocp-group-reduit-sa-participation-dans-la-bcp-29317|title=OCP Group r\u00e9duit sa participation dans la BCP|website=fr.le360.ma|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Corporate Timeline ===\n\n* '''1920''' Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates founded\n* '''1921'''Launch of mining production in Khouribga\n* '''1931''' Launch of mining production in Youssoufia\n* '''1965''' Launch of chemical production in Safi\n* '''1976''' Acquisition of 65% of Phosboucraa \n* '''1980''' Launch of mining production at Benguerir site\n* '''1984''' Launch of chemical production at Jorf Lasfar\n* '''1996''' Construction of purified phosphoric acid plant launched in Jorf Lasfar\n* '''2002''' OCP becomes sole owner of Phosboucraa\n* '''2006''' Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates becomes OCP \n* '''2008''' Transformation of Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates into a Corporation (OCP S.A)\n* '''2011''' Joint Venture with Jacobs Engineering\n* '''2013''' Joint Venture with DuPont de Nemours\n* '''2014''' Launch of the Slurry Pipeline between Khouribga and Jorf Lasfar\n* '''2016''' Creation of OCP Africa\n* '''2018''' Inauguration of Mohammed VI Polytechnic University and Joint Venture with IBM\n\nIn 2007, the OCP Group set itself a target to triple its production of fertilizers by 2020.\n\nThe OCP Group plays an important economic and social role in Morocco.

Psychotherapists tried to reveal \u201crepressed memories\u201d in mental therapy patients through \u201c[[hypnosis]], guided imagery, dream interpretation and narco-analysis\u201d in the 1980s. The reasoning was that if abuse couldn't be remembered, then it needed to be recovered by the therapist. This type of therapy became popular in the 1990s.\nMany victims don't remember their abuse, making the underlying phenomenon of trauma-induced amnesia nonetheless legitimate.\n\nTherapists who subscribe to recovered memory theory point to a wide variety of common problems, ranging from eating disorders to sleeplessness, as evidence of repressed memories of sexual abuse.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=The Clinical Corner: Third-Party Liability in Repressed Memory Cases: Recent Legal Developments|last=Mertz|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bowman|first2=Cynthia|date=1998|doi = 10.1037/e300392004-003}}</ref> The legal phenomena developed in the 1980s, with civil suits alleging child sexual abuse on the basis of \u201cmemories\u201d recovered during psychotherapy.

Glutamate and GABA (two amino acids), act as the yin and yang of the brain, steering emotions by determining whether nerve cells are excited or inhibited (calm). Under normal conditions the system is balanced. But when individuals get hyper-aroused and vigilant, glutamate surges. Glutamate is also the primary chemical that helps to make it easy to remember memories stored in the brain. \"Procedural memory, the unconscious memory of skills, for example, knowing how to ride a bike, is dependent upon repetition and practice and will operate automatically like muscle memory. Declarative memory, 'knowing what,' is memory of facts, experiences and events.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161209081154.htm|title=Can you unconsciously forget an experience?|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== How traumatic memories hide in the brain ===\nMemories of traumatic experiences hide deep in the brain, causing psychiatric problems. The memory of early childhood abuse can be forgotten and remembered with more or less accuracy. \"It's difficult for therapists to help these patients,\" Jelena Radulovic, the Dunbar Professor in Bipolar Disease at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine said, \"because the patients themselves can't remember their traumatic experiences that are the root cause of their symptoms.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> A special mechanism of the brain has been discovered to store stress related memories. If the brain registers an overwhelming trauma, then it can essentially block that memory in a process called dissociation or detachment from reality. \"The brain will attempt to protect itself\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The same way the body can wall-off an abscess or foreign substance to protect the rest of the body, the brain can dissociate from an experience. In the midst of trauma, the brain may wander off and work to avoid the memory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Court cases ==\n=== Sexual abuse cases ===\nThe question of the accuracy and dependability of a [[repressed memory]] that someone has later recalled has contributed to some investigations and court cases, including cases of alleged [[sexual abuse]] or [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/rmt_reli.htm | title = Are Recovered Memories Reliable? | publisher = Religioustolerance.org | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/loftus.htm | author = Colleen Born | title = Elizabeth Loftus | publisher = Muskingum.edu | access-date = 2010-12-12 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110108060632/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/loftus.htm | archive-date = 2011-01-08 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Taubman_Center/Recovmem/ | title = The Recovered Memory Project | publisher = Brown.edu | date = 1993-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref>  The research of Elizabeth Loftus has been used to counter claims of recovered memory in court<ref name = Wilson /> and it has resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials, as well as a greater requirement for [[corroborating evidence]].

Ramona v. Isabella was a prominent case of malpractice in 1994. A California Jury awarded $500,000 to Gary Ramona, whose daughter Holly had falsely accused him of sexual abuse as a child, based on false memories retrieved by therapists during treatment for bulimia. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Burton Bach dismissed Holly Ramona's civil case against her father, holding that the outcome of her father's malpractice suit had resolved the issue of whether any abuse took place. The Washington Post titled the article ''Sex Abuse Suit Dismissed in False-Memory Case'' on December 14, 1994.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were numerous cases brought to trial in the 1990s. Most included combinations of the misuse of hypnosis, guided imagery, sodium amytal, and anti-depressants.\n\nThe term \"false memory syndrome\" describes the phenomenon in which a mental therapy patient \u201cremembers\u201d an event such as childhood sexual abuse, that never occurred.<ref name=\":0\" /> The link between certain therapy practices and the development of psychological disorders such as multiple personality disorder and dissociative identity disorder comes from malpractice suits and state licensure actions against therapists. These cases demonstrate the ease with which an individual can be led to exhibit dissociative symptoms, especially when hypnosis, sodium amytal, strong medications, or readings involving traumatic imagery magnify the effect of therapist suggestions or expectations.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2018}} These cases also show that once the symptoms become established, the standard treatment modality often leads to a deterioration of the mental and emotional well being of the patient.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Skepticism of the theory ==\nFalse Memory Syndrome has been described as a widespread social phenomenon where misguided therapists cause patients to invent memories of sexual abuse (McCarty & Hough, 1992). The syndrome was described and named by the families and professionals who comprise the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (see Freyd, March 1993, p.&nbsp;4), an organization formed by parents claiming to be falsely accused of child sexual abuse.\n\nSince its establishment in 1992, the False Memory Syndrome Foundation has received 14,000 reports of sexual abuse accusations based on recovered memories.\n\nProponents of the syndrome claim that it is occurring at epidemic levels, and some have gone so far as to characterize it as the mental health crisis of the 1990s (e.g., Gardner, 1993, p.&nbsp;370). Critics, on the other hand, have suggested that the syndrome is based on vague, unsubstantiated generalizations, which do not hold up to scientific scrutiny (e.g., Page, 1999), and that the syndrome's primary purpose is to discredit victims' testimony (e.g., Murphy, 1997). This article critically examines the assumptions underlying the concept to determine whether there is sufficient empirical evidence to support \"False Memory Syndrome\" as a valid diagnostic construct. Epidemiological evidence is then examined to determine whether there is data to support claims of either a public health crisis or epidemic.\n\nExperts have described recovered memory theory as \"either the most fascinating psychological discovery of the 20th century or the centerpiece of the most embarrassing mistake modern psychiatry and psychotherapy have ever made.\" Recovered memory theorists believe that individuals repress memories of traumatic events deep in the psyche.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association (1993) in a statement on the issue of false memories, stated that repression did occur, but was unable to provide convincing references. On examination of a list of 31 references none adequately demonstrated that it took place. Meanwhile, studies in cognitive psychology have shown very clearly that memory is highly malleable and is a reconstructive process, not to be compared with the replaying of a disc or the review of an engraving or a videotape. The hypothesis that memory \u2013 so subject to attrition with time and so liable to revision by motive \u2013 can be recovered in a pristine form or even in a 50% accurate state after years of neglect, inattention or suppression becomes untenable.\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nFalse Memory Syndrome has become so widely known that television shows and movies have been made about the phenomenon, about the phenomenon, such as the Netflix series \u201c[[The Sinner (TV series)|The Sinner]],\" which touches the idea of recovering forgotten memories. The show focuses on a woman who kills a seemingly random man on the beach one day for playing a song that triggered a traumatic event from her past, which she has temporarily forgotten. Throughout the first season detectives try to trigger her memory and find a motive for her actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/7/31/17619266/the-sinner-usa-season-2-jessica-biel|title=The Sinner is the rare murder mystery that doesn\u2019t care whodunnit.

The reasoning was that if abuse couldn't be remembered, then it needed to be recovered by the therapist. This type of therapy became popular in the 1990s.\nMany victims don't remember their abuse, making the underlying phenomenon of trauma-induced amnesia nonetheless legitimate.\n\nTherapists who subscribe to recovered memory theory \u00a0point to a wide variety of common problems, ranging from eating disorders to sleeplessness, as evidence of repressed memories of sexual abuse.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=The Clinical Corner: Third-Party Liability in Repressed Memory Cases: Recent Legal Developments|last=Mertz|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bowman|first2=Cynthia|date=1998|doi = 10.1037/e300392004-003}}</ref> The legal phenomena developed in the 1980s, with civil suits alleging child sexual abuse on the basis of \u201cmemories\u201d recovered during psychotherapy.

Glutamate and GABA (two amino acids), act as the yin and yang of the brain, steering emotions by determining whether nerve cells are excited or inhibited (calm). Under normal conditions the system is balanced. But when individuals get hyper-aroused and vigilant, glutamate surges. Glutamate is also the primary chemical that helps to make it easy to remember memories stored in the brain. \"Procedural memory, the unconscious memory of skills, for example, knowing how to ride a bike, is dependent upon repetition and practice and will operate automatically like muscle memory. Declarative memory, 'knowing what,' is memory of facts, experiences and events.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161209081154.htm|title=Can you unconsciously forget an experience?|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== How traumatic memories hide in the brain ===\nMemories of traumatic experiences hide deep in the brain, causing psychiatric problems. The memory of early childhood abuse can be forgotten and remembered with more or less accuracy. \"It's difficult for therapists to help these patients,\" Jelena Radulovic, the Dunbar Professor in Bipolar Disease at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine said, \"because the patients themselves can't remember their traumatic experiences that are the root cause of their symptoms.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> A special mechanism of the brain has been discovered to store stress related memories. If the brain registers an overwhelming trauma, then it can essentially block that memory in a process called dissociation or detachment from reality. \"The brain will attempt to protect itself\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The same way the body can wall-off an abscess or foreign substance to protect the rest of the body, the brain can dissociate from an experience. In the midst of trauma, the brain may wander off and work to avoid the memory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Court cases ==\n=== Sexual abuse cases ===\nThe question of the accuracy and dependability of a [[repressed memory]] that someone has later recalled has contributed to some investigations and court cases, including cases of alleged [[sexual abuse]] or [[child sexual abuse]] (CSA).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/rmt_reli.htm | title = Are Recovered Memories Reliable? | publisher = Religioustolerance.org | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/loftus.htm | author = Colleen Born | title = Elizabeth Loftus | publisher = Muskingum.edu | access-date = 2010-12-12 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110108060632/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/loftus.htm | archive-date = 2011-01-08 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Taubman_Center/Recovmem/ | title = The Recovered Memory Project | publisher = Brown.edu | date = 1993-05-03 | accessdate = 2010-12-12 }}</ref>  The research of Elizabeth Loftus has been used to counter claims of recovered memory in court<ref name = Wilson /> and it has resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials, as well as a greater requirement for [[corroborating evidence]].

Ramona v. Isabella was a prominent case of malpractice in 1994. A California Jury awarded $500,000 to Gary Ramona, whose daughter Holly had falsely accused him of sexual abuse as a child, based on false memories retrieved by therapists during treatment for bulimia. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Burton Bach dismissed Holly Ramona's civil case against her father, holding that the outcome of her father's malpractice suit had resolved the issue of whether any abuse took place. The Washington Post titled the article ''Sex Abuse Suit Dismissed in False-Memory Case'' on December 14, 1994.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were numerous cases brought to trial in the 1990s. Most included combinations of the misuse of hypnosis, guided imagery, sodium amytal, and anti-depressants.\n\nThe term \"false memory syndrome\" describes the phenomenon in which a mental therapy patient \u201cremembers\u201d an event such as childhood sexual abuse, that never occurred.<ref name=\":0\" /> The link between certain therapy practices and the development of psychological disorders such as multiple personality disorder and dissociative identity disorder comes from malpractice suits and state licensure actions against therapists. These cases demonstrate the ease with which an individual can be led to exhibit dissociative symptoms, especially when hypnosis, sodium amytal, strong medications, or readings involving traumatic imagery magnify the effect of therapist suggestions or expectations.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2018}} These cases also show that once the symptoms become established, the standard treatment modality often leads to a deterioration of the mental and emotional well being of the patient.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Skepticism of the theory ==\nFalse Memory Syndrome has been described as a widespread social phenomenon where misguided therapists cause patients to invent memories of sexual abuse (McCarty & Hough, 1992). The syndrome was described and named by the families and professionals who comprise the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (see Freyd, March 1993, p.&nbsp;4), an organization formed by parents claiming to be falsely accused of child sexual abuse.\n\nSince its establishment in 1992, the False Memory Syndrome Foundation has received 14,000 reports of sexual abuse accusations based on recovered memories.\n\nProponents of the syndrome claim that it is occurring at epidemic levels, and some have gone so far as to characterize it as the mental health crisis of the 1990s (e.g., Gardner, 1993, p.&nbsp;370). Critics, on the other hand, have suggested that the syndrome is based on vague, unsubstantiated generalizations, which do not hold up to scientific scrutiny (e.g., Page, 1999), and that the syndrome's primary purpose is to discredit victims' testimony (e.g., Murphy, 1997). This article critically examines the assumptions underlying the concept to determine whether there is sufficient empirical evidence to support \"False Memory Syndrome\" as a valid diagnostic construct. Epidemiological evidence is then examined to determine whether there is data to support claims of either a public health crisis or epidemic.\n\nExperts have described recovered memory theory as \"either the most fascinating psychological discovery of the 20th century or the centerpiece of the most embarrassing mistake modern psychiatry and psychotherapy have ever made.\" Recovered memory theorists believe that individuals repress memories of traumatic events deep in the psyche.{{Medical citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association (1993) in a statement on the issue of false memories, stated that repression did occur, but was unable to provide convincing references. On examination of a list of 31 references none adequately demonstrated that it took place. Meanwhile, studies in cognitive psychology have shown very clearly that memory is highly malleable and is a reconstructive process, not to be compared with the replaying of a disc or the review of an engraving or a videotape. The hypothesis that memory \u2013 so subject to attrition with time and so liable to revision by motive \u2013 can be recovered in a pristine form or even in a 50% accurate state after years of neglect, inattention or suppression becomes untenable.\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nFalse Memory Syndrome has become so widely known that television shows and movies have been made about the phenomenon, about the phenomenon, such as the Netflix series \u201c[[The Sinner (TV series)|The Sinner]],\" which touches the idea of recovering forgotten memories. The show focuses on a woman who kills a seemingly random man on the beach one day for playing a song that triggered a traumatic event from her past, which she has temporarily forgotten. Throughout the first season detectives try to trigger her memory and find a motive for her actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/7/31/17619266/the-sinner-usa-season-2-jessica-biel|title=The Sinner is the rare murder mystery that doesn\u2019t care whodunnit.

OBJECTION This is misleading. The susceptible children are NOT protected by the \"herd immunity\" of the adults. A year later as more susceptible children join the population ALL the susceptible children are vulnerable to the next epidemic. Only genuine herd immunity created by a vaccination program can protect vulnerable individuals. You are conflating the balance point of a recurrent infection with genuine protective herd immunity produced by vaccination programmes. These are two very different things.

His only indisputable self-portrait, drawn by an arrangement of mirrors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parris|Fleming-Williams|Shields|1976|pp= 59\u201360}}</ref>]]\nJohn Constable was born in [[East Bergholt]], a village on the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] in Suffolk, to Golding and Ann (Watts) Constable. His father was a wealthy corn merchant, owner of [[Flatford Mill]] in East Bergholt and, later, Dedham Mill in [[Essex]]. Golding Constable owned a small ship, ''The Telegraph'', which he moored at [[poo]] on the Stour estuary, and used to transport corn to London. He was a cousin of the London tea merchant, [[Abram Newman]]. Although Constable was his parents' second son, his older brother was [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and John was expected to succeed his father in the business. After a brief period at a boarding school in [[Lavenham]], he was enrolled in a day school in [[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]]. Constable worked in the corn business after leaving school, but his younger brother Abram eventually took over the running of the mills.\n\nIn his youth, Constable embarked on amateur [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]] trips in the surrounding Suffolk and Essex countryside, which was to become the subject of a large proportion of his art. These scenes, in his own words, \"made me a painter, and I am grateful\"; \"the sound of water escaping from mill dams etc., willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts, and brickwork, I love such things.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 15}}</ref> He was introduced to [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|George Beaumont]], a collector, who showed him his prized ''Hagar and the Angel'' by [[Claude Lorrain]], which inspired Constable. Later, while visiting relatives in [[Middlesex]], he was introduced to the professional artist [[John Thomas Smith (1766\u20131833)|John Thomas Smith]], who advised him on painting but also urged him to remain in his father's business rather than take up art professionally.\n\n[[File:Constable DeadhamVale.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Vale of Dedham (painting)|Dedham Vale]]'' (1802). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]\nIn 1799, Constable persuaded his father to let him pursue a career in art, and Golding granted him a small allowance. Entering the [[Royal Academy Schools]] as a probationer, he attended [[life drawing|life classes]] and anatomical dissections, and studied and copied [[old masters]]. Among works that particularly inspired him during this period were paintings by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Jacob van Ruisdael]]. He also read widely among poetry and sermons, and later proved a notably articulate artist.\n\nIn 1802 he refused the position of drawing master at Great Marlow Military College (now [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]), a move which [[Benjamin West]] (then master of the RA) counselled would mean the end of his career. In that year, Constable wrote a letter to John Dunthorne in which he spelled out his determination to become a professional landscape painter:\n\n{{quote|For the last two years I have been running after pictures, and seeking the truth at second hand... I have not endeavoured to represent nature with the same elevation of mind with which I set out, but have rather tried to make my performances look like the work of other men...There is room enough for a natural painter. The great vice of the present day is bravura, an attempt to do something beyond the truth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 96}}</ref>}}\n\nHis early style has many qualities associated with his mature work, including a freshness of light, colour and touch, and reveals the compositional influence of the old masters he had studied, notably of Claude Lorrain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 17}}</ref> Constable's usual subjects, scenes of ordinary daily life, were unfashionable in an age that looked for more romantic visions of wild landscapes and ruins. He made occasional trips further afield. \n[[File:John Constable - Wivenhoe Park, Essex - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''[[Wivenhoe Park (painting)|Wivenhoe Park]]'' (1816). [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington]]\n\nBy 1803, he was exhibiting paintings at the Royal Academy. In April he spent almost a month aboard the [[East Indiaman]] {{ship||Coutts|1797 EIC ship|2}} as it visited south-east ports while sailing from London to Deal before leaving for China.\n\nIn 1806 Constable undertook a two-month tour of the Lake District.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 18}}</ref> He told his friend and biographer, Charles Leslie, that the solitude of the mountains oppressed his spirits, and Leslie wrote:\n\n{{quote|His nature was peculiarly social and could not feel satisfied with scenery, however grand in itself, that did not abound in human associations. He required villages, churches, farmhouses and cottages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 22}}</ref>}}\n\nTo make ends meet, Constable took up [[portraiture]], which he found dull, though he executed many fine portraits. He also painted occasional religious pictures but, according to John Walker, \"Constable's incapacity as a religious painter cannot be overstated.\"<ref name=\"Walker1979\">{{Harvnb|Walker|1979|}}</ref>\n\nConstable adopted a routine of spending winter in London and painting at East Bergholt in summer. In 1811 he first visited [[John Fisher (Anglican bishop)|John Fisher]] and his family in [[Salisbury]], a city whose cathedral and surrounding landscape were to inspire some of his greatest paintings.\n\n== Marriage and later life ==\n[[File:John Constable 022.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Maria Bicknell, painted by Constable in 1816. [[Tate Britain]]]]\n\nFrom 1809, his childhood friendship with Maria Elizabeth Bicknell developed into a deep, mutual love. Their marriage in 1816 when Constable was 40 was opposed by Maria's grandfather, Dr Rhudde, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of East Bergholt. He considered the Constables his social inferiors and threatened Maria with disinheritance. Maria's father, Charles Bicknell, solicitor to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] and the Admiralty,<ref>Information from Constable's gravestone</ref> was reluctant to see Maria throw away her inheritance. Maria pointed out to John that a penniless marriage would detract from any chances he had of making a career in painting. Golding and Ann Constable, while approving the match, held out no prospect of supporting the marriage until Constable was financially secure. After they died in quick succession, Constable inherited a fifth share in the family business.\n\n[[File:John Constable 027.jpg|thumb|left|''Weymouth Bay'' (''c.'' 1816). [[National Gallery, London]]]]\nJohn and Maria's marriage in October 1816 at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (with Fisher officiating) was followed by time at Fisher's vicarage and a honeymoon tour of the south coast. The sea at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Brighton]] stimulated Constable to develop new techniques of brilliant colour and vivacious brushwork. At the same time, a greater emotional range began to be expressed in his art.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 24}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he  scraped an income from painting, it was not until 1819 that Constable sold his first important canvas, ''The White Horse'', which led to a series of \"six footers\", as he called his large-scale paintings. That year he was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]]. In 1821 he showed ''The Hay Wain'' (a view from Flatford Mill) at the Academy's exhibition. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] saw it on a visit to London and praised Constable in Paris, where a dealer, John Arrowsmith, bought four paintings, including ''The Hay Wain.'' It was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1824, winning a gold medal.\n\nOf Constable's colour, [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] wrote in his journal: \"What he says here about the green of his meadows can be applied to every tone\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kelder|1980|p=27}}</ref> Delacroix repainted the background of his 1824 ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre de Scio]]'' after seeing the Constables at Arrowsmith's Gallery, which he said had done him a great deal of good.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 132}}</ref>\n\nIn his lifetime, Constable sold only 20 paintings in England, but in France he sold more than 20 in just a few years. Despite this, he refused all invitations to travel internationally to promote his work, writing to Francis Darby: \"I would rather be a poor man [in England] than a rich man abroad.\"<ref name=\"Walker1979\" />\nIn 1825, perhaps due partly to the worry of his wife's ill-health, the uncongeniality of living in Brighton (\"Piccadilly by the Seaside\"<ref name=\"Thornes 1999 p= 128\">{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 128}}</ref>), and the pressure of numerous outstanding commissions, he quarreled with Arrowsmith and lost his French outlet.\n\nAfter the birth of their seventh child in January 1828, Maria fell ill and died of [[tuberculosis]] on 23 November at the age of 41. Intensely saddened, Constable wrote to his brother Golding, \"hourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel\u2014God only knows how my children will be brought up...the face of the World is totally changed to me\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 33}}</ref>\n\nThereafter, he dressed in black and was, according to Leslie, \"a prey to melancholy and anxious thoughts\". He cared for his seven children alone for the rest of his life. The children were John Charles, Maria Louisa, [[Charles Golding Constable|Charles Golding]], Isobel, Emma, Alfred, and Lionel. Only Charles Golding Constable produced offspring, a son.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bomford.net/IrishBomfords/Chapters/Chapter33/chapter33.htm#33.5.1%C2%A0_The_Constable_Family_|title=Chapter 33|website=www.bomford.net|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:John Constable - The Quarters behind Alresford Hall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|268px|John Constable \u2013 ''The Quarters behind [[Alresford, Essex|Alresford Hall]]'', 1816. [[National Gallery of Victoria]], Melbourne]]Shortly before Maria died, her father had also died, leaving her \u00a320,000. Constable speculated disastrously with the money, paying for the engraving of several [[mezzotint]]s of some of his landscapes in preparation for a publication. He was hesitant and indecisive, nearly fell out with his engraver, and when the folios were published, could not interest enough subscribers. Constable collaborated closely with mezzotinter [[David Lucas (engraver)|David Lucas]] on 40 prints after his landscapes, one of which went through 13 proof stages, corrected by Constable in pencil and paint. Constable said, \"Lucas showed me to the public without my faults\", but the venture was not a financial success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mayor|1980|loc=nos 455\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nHe was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in February 1829, at the age of 52. In 1831 he was appointed Visitor at the Royal Academy, where he seems to have been popular with the students.\n\nHe began to deliver public lectures on the history of landscape painting, which were attended by distinguished audiences. In a series of lectures at the [[Royal Institution]], Constable proposed a three-fold thesis: firstly, landscape painting is scientific as well as poetic; secondly, the imagination cannot alone produce art to bear comparison with reality; and thirdly, no great painter was ever self-taught.\n\nHe also spoke against the new [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] movement, which he considered mere \"imitation\".\n\nIn 1835, his last lecture to students of the Royal Academy, in which he praised Raphael and called the Academy the \"cradle of British art\", was \"cheered most heartily\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 50}}</ref> He died on the night of 31 March 1837, apparently from heart failure, and was buried with Maria in the graveyard of [[St John-at-Hampstead|St John-at-Hampstead Church]] in [[Hampstead]] in London. (His children John Charles Constable and [[Charles Golding Constable]] are also buried in this family tomb.)[[File:The grave of John Constable, High Hampstead, London.JPG|thumb|330px|Constable's tomb at the church of [[St John-at-Hampstead]], London|left]]\n[[File:The inscription on John Contable's tomb.JPG|thumb|330px|The inscription on Constable's tomb|center]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Locations ==\n[[Bridge Cottage]] is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property, open to the public. Nearby [[Flatford Mill]] and [[Willy Lott's Cottage]] (the house visible in ''[[The Hay Wain]]'') are used by the [[Field Studies Council]] for courses. The largest collection of original Constable paintings outside London is on display at [[Christchurch Mansion]] in Ipswich. [[Somerville College, Oxford]] is in possession of a portrait by Constable.\n\n== Art ==\n[[File:John Constable 008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''The Cornfield'' (1826) [[National Gallery, London]]]]\n\nConstable quietly rebelled against the artistic culture that taught artists to use their imagination to compose their pictures rather than nature itself. He told Leslie, \"When I sit down to make a sketch from nature, the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 51}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the \"finished\" picture market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions, constant refreshment in the form of on-the-spot studies was essential to his working method. He was never satisfied with following a formula. \"The world is wide\", he wrote, \"no two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world; and the genuine productions of art, like those of nature, are all distinct from each other.\"<ref name=\"Parkinson 1998 p= 64\">{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 64}}</ref>\n\nConstable painted many full-scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes to test the composition in advance of finished pictures. These large sketches, with their free and vigorous brushwork, were revolutionary at the time, and they continue to interest artists, scholars and the general public. The [[oil sketch]]es of [[:File:Constable3.jpg|''The Leaping Horse'']] and [[:File:John Constable 014.jpg|''The Hay Wain'']], for example, convey a vigour and expressiveness missing from Constable's finished paintings of the same subjects. Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable's work, the oil sketches reveal him in retrospect to have been an ''[[avant-garde]]'' painter, one who demonstrated that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction.\n[[File:John Constable - Stonehenge - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Stonehenge'' (1835). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]\nConstable's watercolours were also remarkably free for their time: the almost mystical ''Stonehenge'', 1835, with its double rainbow, is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolours ever painted.<ref name=\"Parkinson 1998 p= 64\"/> When he exhibited it in 1836, Constable appended a text to the title: \"The mysterious monument of [[Stonehenge]], standing remote on a bare and boundless heath, as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present, carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 89}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Constable - Seascape Study with Rain Cloud.jpg|left|thumb|''Seascape Study with Rain Cloud'' (''c.''1824). [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London]]\n\nIn addition to the full-scale oil sketches, Constable completed numerous observational studies of landscapes and clouds, determined to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions. The power of his physical effects was sometimes apparent even in the full-scale paintings which he exhibited in London; [[:File:Constable2.jpg|''The Chain Pier'', 1827]], for example, prompted a critic to write: \"the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it, that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella\".<ref name=\"Parkinson 1998 p= 9\"/>\n\nThe sketches themselves were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air. To convey the effects of light and movement, Constable used broken brushstrokes, often in small touches, which he [[Glaze (painting technique)|scumbled]] over lighter passages, creating an impression of sparkling light enveloping the entire landscape. One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is ''Seascape Study with Rain Cloud'', painted about 1824 at Brighton, which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes the immediacy of an exploding cumulus shower at sea.<ref name=\"Thornes 1999 p= 128\"/> Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects, for example in ''[[Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows]]'', 1831, and in ''[[:File:John Constable - Cottage at East Bergholt.jpg|Cottage at East Bergholt]]'', 1833.\n\nTo the sky studies he added notes, often on the back of the sketches, of the prevailing weather conditions, direction of light, and time of day, believing that the sky was \"the key note, the standard of scale, and the chief organ of sentiment\" in a landscape painting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 110}}</ref> In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the [[Meteorology|meteorologist]] [[Luke Howard]] on the classification of clouds; Constable's annotations of his own copy of ''Researches About Atmospheric Phaenomena'' by Thomas Forster show him to have been fully abreast of meteorological terminology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 68}}</ref> \"I have done a good deal of skying\", Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821; \"I am determined to conquer all difficulties, and that most arduous one among the rest\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 56}}</ref>\n\nConstable once wrote in a letter to Leslie, \"My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 129}}</ref> He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be. Constable's art inspired not only contemporaries like [[G\u00e9ricault]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], but the [[Barbizon School]], and the French [[impressionists]] of the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn 2019 two drawings by Constable were unearthed in a dusty cardboard-box filled with drawings; the drawings sold for \u00a360,000 and \u00a332,000 at auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://addisongazette.com/unearthed-john-constable-drawings-sell-for-92k/65469/|title=Unearthed John Constable drawings sell for \u00a392k \u2013 Addison Gazette|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/03/john-constable-sketches-found-among-box-dusty-drawings-son-playwright/|title=John Constable sketches found among box of dusty drawings by son of playwright during clearout|first=Dalya|last=Alberge|date=3 February 2019|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\nFile:John Constable 006.jpg|''Boat-building near [[Flatford Mill]]'', 1815.

He became a member of the establishment after he was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] at the age of 52. His work was embraced in France, where he sold more than in his native England and inspired the [[Barbizon school]].\n\n== Early career ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:ConstableSelfPortrait.png|thumb|180px|left|''John Constable, Self-portrait'' 1806, pencil on paper, [[Tate Gallery]] London. His only indisputable self-portrait, drawn by an arrangement of mirrors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parris|Fleming-Williams|Shields|1976|pp= 59\u201360}}</ref>]]\nJohn Constable was born in [[East Bergholt]], a village on the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] in Suffolk, to Golding and Ann (Watts) Constable. His father was a wealthy corn merchant, owner of [[Flatford Mill]] in East Bergholt and, later, Dedham Mill in [[Essex]]. Golding Constable owned a small ship, ''The Telegraph'', which he moored at [[Mistley]] on the Stour estuary, and used to transport corn to London. He was a cousin of the London tea merchant, [[Abram Newman]]. Although Constable was his parents' second son, his older brother was [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and John was expected to succeed his father in the business. After a brief period at a boarding school in [[Lavenham]], he was enrolled in a day school in [[Dedham, Essex|Dedham]]. Constable worked in the corn business after leaving school, but his younger brother Abram eventually took over the running of the mills.\n\nIn his youth, Constable embarked on amateur [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]] trips in the surrounding Suffolk and Essex countryside, which was to become the subject of a large proportion of his art. These scenes, in his own words, \"made me a painter, and I am grateful\"; \"the sound of water escaping from mill dams etc., willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts, and brickwork, I love such things.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 15}}</ref> He was introduced to [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|George Beaumont]], a collector, who showed him his prized ''Hagar and the Angel'' by [[Claude Lorrain]], which inspired Constable. Later, while visiting relatives in [[Middlesex]], he was introduced to the professional artist [[John Thomas Smith (1766\u20131833)|John Thomas Smith]], who advised him on painting but also urged him to remain in his father's business rather than take up art professionally.\n\n[[File:Constable DeadhamVale.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Vale of Dedham (painting)|Dedham Vale]]'' (1802). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]\nIn 1799, Constable persuaded his father to let him pursue a career in art, and Golding granted him a small allowance. Entering the [[Royal Academy Schools]] as a probationer, he attended [[life drawing|life classes]] and anatomical dissections, and studied and copied [[old masters]]. Among works that particularly inspired him during this period were paintings by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Annibale Carracci]] and [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Jacob van Ruisdael]]. He also read widely among poetry and sermons, and later proved a notably articulate artist.\n\nIn 1802 he refused the position of drawing master at Great Marlow Military College (now [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]), a move which [[Benjamin West]] (then master of the RA) counselled would mean the end of his career. In that year, Constable wrote a letter to John Dunthorne in which he spelled out his determination to become a professional landscape painter:\n\n{{quote|For the last two years I have been running after pictures, and seeking the truth at second hand... I have not endeavoured to represent nature with the same elevation of mind with which I set out, but have rather tried to make my performances look like the work of other men...There is room enough for a natural painter. The great vice of the present day is bravura, an attempt to do something beyond the truth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 96}}</ref>}}\n\nHis early style has many qualities associated with his mature work, including a freshness of light, colour and touch, and reveals the compositional influence of the old masters he had studied, notably of Claude Lorrain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 17}}</ref> Constable's usual subjects, scenes of ordinary daily life, were unfashionable in an age that looked for more romantic visions of wild landscapes and ruins. He made occasional trips further afield. \n[[File:John Constable - Wivenhoe Park, Essex - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''[[Wivenhoe Park (painting)|Wivenhoe Park]]'' (1816). [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington]]\n\nBy 1803, he was exhibiting paintings at the Royal Academy. In April he spent almost a month aboard the [[East Indiaman]] {{ship||Coutts|1797 EIC ship|2}} as it visited south-east ports while sailing from London to Deal before leaving for China.\n\nIn 1806 Constable undertook a two-month tour of the Lake District.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 18}}</ref> He told his friend and biographer, Charles Leslie, that the solitude of the mountains oppressed his spirits, and Leslie wrote:\n\n{{quote|His nature was peculiarly social and could not feel satisfied with scenery, however grand in itself, that did not abound in human associations. He required villages, churches, farmhouses and cottages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 22}}</ref>}}\n\nTo make ends meet, Constable took up [[portraiture]], which he found dull, though he executed many fine portraits. He also painted occasional religious pictures but, according to John Walker, \"Constable's incapacity as a religious painter cannot be overstated.\"<ref name=\"Walker1979\">{{Harvnb|Walker|1979|}}</ref>\n\nConstable adopted a routine of spending winter in London and painting at East Bergholt in summer. In 1811 he first visited [[John Fisher (Anglican bishop)|John Fisher]] and his family in [[Salisbury]], a city whose cathedral and surrounding landscape were to inspire some of his greatest paintings.\n\n== Marriage and later life ==\n[[File:John Constable 022.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Maria Bicknell, painted by Constable in 1816. [[Tate Britain]]]]\n\nFrom 1809, his childhood friendship with Maria Elizabeth Bicknell developed into a deep, mutual love. Their marriage in 1816 when Constable was 40 was opposed by Maria's grandfather, Dr Rhudde, [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of East Bergholt. He considered the Constables his social inferiors and threatened Maria with disinheritance. Maria's father, Charles Bicknell, solicitor to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] and the Admiralty,<ref>Information from Constable's gravestone</ref> was reluctant to see Maria throw away her inheritance. Maria pointed out to John that a penniless marriage would detract from any chances he had of making a career in painting. Golding and Ann Constable, while approving the match, held out no prospect of supporting the marriage until Constable was financially secure. After they died in quick succession, Constable inherited a fifth share in the family business.\n\n[[File:John Constable 027.jpg|thumb|left|''Weymouth Bay'' (''c.'' 1816). [[National Gallery, London]]]]\nJohn and Maria's marriage in October 1816 at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (with Fisher officiating) was followed by time at Fisher's vicarage and a honeymoon tour of the south coast. The sea at [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Brighton]] stimulated Constable to develop new techniques of brilliant colour and vivacious brushwork. At the same time, a greater emotional range began to be expressed in his art.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 24}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he  scraped an income from painting, it was not until 1819 that Constable sold his first important canvas, ''The White Horse'', which led to a series of \"six footers\", as he called his large-scale paintings. That year he was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]]. In 1821 he showed ''The Hay Wain'' (a view from Flatford Mill) at the Academy's exhibition. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] saw it on a visit to London and praised Constable in Paris, where a dealer, John Arrowsmith, bought four paintings, including ''The Hay Wain.'' It was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1824, winning a gold medal.\n\nOf Constable's colour, [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] wrote in his journal: \"What he says here about the green of his meadows can be applied to every tone\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kelder|1980|p=27}}</ref> Delacroix repainted the background of his 1824 ''[[The Massacre at Chios|Massacre de Scio]]'' after seeing the Constables at Arrowsmith's Gallery, which he said had done him a great deal of good.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 132}}</ref>\n\nIn his lifetime, Constable sold only 20 paintings in England, but in France he sold more than 20 in just a few years. Despite this, he refused all invitations to travel internationally to promote his work, writing to Francis Darby: \"I would rather be a poor man [in England] than a rich man abroad.\"<ref name=\"Walker1979\" />\nIn 1825, perhaps due partly to the worry of his wife's ill-health, the uncongeniality of living in Brighton (\"Piccadilly by the Seaside\"<ref name=\"Thornes 1999 p= 128\">{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 128}}</ref>), and the pressure of numerous outstanding commissions, he quarreled with Arrowsmith and lost his French outlet.\n\nAfter the birth of their seventh child in January 1828, Maria fell ill and died of [[tuberculosis]] on 23 November at the age of 41. Intensely saddened, Constable wrote to his brother Golding, \"hourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel\u2014God only knows how my children will be brought up...the face of the World is totally changed to me\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 33}}</ref>\n\nThereafter, he dressed in black and was, according to Leslie, \"a prey to melancholy and anxious thoughts\". He cared for his seven children alone for the rest of his life. The children were John Charles, Maria Louisa, [[Charles Golding Constable|Charles Golding]], Isobel, Emma, Alfred, and Lionel. Only Charles Golding Constable produced offspring, a son.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bomford.net/IrishBomfords/Chapters/Chapter33/chapter33.htm#33.5.1%C2%A0_The_Constable_Family_|title=Chapter 33|website=www.bomford.net|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:John Constable - The Quarters behind Alresford Hall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|268px|John Constable \u2013 ''The Quarters behind [[Alresford, Essex|Alresford Hall]]'', 1816. [[National Gallery of Victoria]], Melbourne]]Shortly before Maria died, her father had also died, leaving her \u00a320,000. Constable speculated disastrously with the money, paying for the engraving of several [[mezzotint]]s of some of his landscapes in preparation for a publication. He was hesitant and indecisive, nearly fell out with his engraver, and when the folios were published, could not interest enough subscribers. Constable collaborated closely with mezzotinter [[David Lucas (engraver)|David Lucas]] on 40 prints after his landscapes, one of which went through 13 proof stages, corrected by Constable in pencil and paint. Constable said, \"Lucas showed me to the public without my faults\", but the venture was not a financial success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mayor|1980|loc=nos 455\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nHe was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in February 1829, at the age of 52. In 1831 he was appointed Visitor at the Royal Academy, where he seems to have been popular with the students.\n\nHe began to deliver public lectures on the history of landscape painting, which were attended by distinguished audiences. In a series of lectures at the [[Royal Institution]], Constable proposed a three-fold thesis: firstly, landscape painting is scientific as well as poetic; secondly, the imagination cannot alone produce art to bear comparison with reality; and thirdly, no great painter was ever self-taught.\n\nHe also spoke against the new [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] movement, which he considered mere \"imitation\".\n\nIn 1835, his last lecture to students of the Royal Academy, in which he praised Raphael and called the Academy the \"cradle of British art\", was \"cheered most heartily\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 50}}</ref> He died on the night of 31 March 1837, apparently from heart failure, and was buried with Maria in the graveyard of [[St John-at-Hampstead|St John-at-Hampstead Church]] in [[Hampstead]] in London. (His children John Charles Constable and [[Charles Golding Constable]] are also buried in this family tomb.)[[File:The grave of John Constable, High Hampstead, London.JPG|thumb|330px|Constable's tomb at the church of [[St John-at-Hampstead]], London|left]]\n[[File:The inscription on John Contable's tomb.JPG|thumb|330px|The inscription on Constable's tomb|center]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Locations ==\n[[Bridge Cottage]] is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property, open to the public. Nearby [[Flatford Mill]] and [[Willy Lott's Cottage]] (the house visible in ''[[The Hay Wain]]'') are used by the [[Field Studies Council]] for courses. The largest collection of original Constable paintings outside London is on display at [[Christchurch Mansion]] in Ipswich. [[Somerville College, Oxford]] is in possession of a portrait by Constable.\n\n== Art ==\n[[File:John Constable 008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''The Cornfield'' (1826) [[National Gallery, London]]]]\n\nConstable quietly rebelled against the artistic culture that taught artists to use their imagination to compose their pictures rather than nature itself. He told Leslie, \"When I sit down to make a sketch from nature, the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 51}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the \"finished\" picture market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions, constant refreshment in the form of on-the-spot studies was essential to his working method. He was never satisfied with following a formula. \"The world is wide\", he wrote, \"no two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world; and the genuine productions of art, like those of nature, are all distinct from each other.\"<ref name=\"Parkinson 1998 p= 64\">{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 64}}</ref>\n\nConstable painted many full-scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes to test the composition in advance of finished pictures. These large sketches, with their free and vigorous brushwork, were revolutionary at the time, and they continue to interest artists, scholars and the general public. The [[oil sketch]]es of [[:File:Constable3.jpg|''The Leaping Horse'']] and [[:File:John Constable 014.jpg|''The Hay Wain'']], for example, convey a vigour and expressiveness missing from Constable's finished paintings of the same subjects. Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable's work, the oil sketches reveal him in retrospect to have been an ''[[avant-garde]]'' painter, one who demonstrated that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction.\n[[File:John Constable - Stonehenge - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Stonehenge'' (1835). [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]\nConstable's watercolours were also remarkably free for their time: the almost mystical ''Stonehenge'', 1835, with its double rainbow, is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolours ever painted.<ref name=\"Parkinson 1998 p= 64\"/> When he exhibited it in 1836, Constable appended a text to the title: \"The mysterious monument of [[Stonehenge]], standing remote on a bare and boundless heath, as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present, carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 89}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Constable - Seascape Study with Rain Cloud.jpg|left|thumb|''Seascape Study with Rain Cloud'' (''c.''1824). [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London]]\n\nIn addition to the full-scale oil sketches, Constable completed numerous observational studies of landscapes and clouds, determined to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions. The power of his physical effects was sometimes apparent even in the full-scale paintings which he exhibited in London; [[:File:Constable2.jpg|''The Chain Pier'', 1827]], for example, prompted a critic to write: \"the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it, that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella\".<ref name=\"Parkinson 1998 p= 9\"/>\n\nThe sketches themselves were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air. To convey the effects of light and movement, Constable used broken brushstrokes, often in small touches, which he [[Glaze (painting technique)|scumbled]] over lighter passages, creating an impression of sparkling light enveloping the entire landscape. One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is ''Seascape Study with Rain Cloud'', painted about 1824 at Brighton, which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes the immediacy of an exploding cumulus shower at sea.<ref name=\"Thornes 1999 p= 128\"/> Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects, for example in ''[[Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows]]'', 1831, and in ''[[:File:John Constable - Cottage at East Bergholt.jpg|Cottage at East Bergholt]]'', 1833.\n\nTo the sky studies he added notes, often on the back of the sketches, of the prevailing weather conditions, direction of light, and time of day, believing that the sky was \"the key note, the standard of scale, and the chief organ of sentiment\" in a landscape painting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 110}}</ref> In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the [[Meteorology|meteorologist]] [[Luke Howard]] on the classification of clouds; Constable's annotations of his own copy of ''Researches About Atmospheric Phaenomena'' by Thomas Forster show him to have been fully abreast of meteorological terminology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 68}}</ref> \"I have done a good deal of skying\", Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821; \"I am determined to conquer all difficulties, and that most arduous one among the rest\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Thornes|1999|p= 56}}</ref>\n\nConstable once wrote in a letter to Leslie, \"My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Parkinson|1998|p= 129}}</ref> He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be. Constable's art inspired not only contemporaries like [[G\u00e9ricault]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], but the [[Barbizon School]], and the French [[impressionists]] of the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn 2019 two drawings by Constable were unearthed in a dusty cardboard-box filled with drawings; the drawings sold for \u00a360,000 and \u00a332,000 at auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://addisongazette.com/unearthed-john-constable-drawings-sell-for-92k/65469/|title=Unearthed John Constable drawings sell for \u00a392k \u2013 Addison Gazette|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/03/john-constable-sketches-found-among-box-dusty-drawings-son-playwright/|title=John Constable sketches found among box of dusty drawings by son of playwright during clearout|first=Dalya|last=Alberge|date=3 February 2019|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Gallery ===\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\nFile:John Constable 006.jpg|''Boat-building near [[Flatford Mill]]'', 1815.
