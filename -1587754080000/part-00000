Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n-->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===25===\n\n===24===\n*[[Abdullah al-Hamid]], 69, Saudi poet and human rights activist, co-founder of the [[Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association]], stroke.<ref>[https://www.arab48.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9/2020/04/24/%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B2-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%AF-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%86 \u0648\u0641\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0632 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0645\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062c\u0646] {{in lang|ar}}</ref>\n*[[Dimitri Diatchenko]], 52, American actor (''[[Chernobyl Diaries]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'').<ref>[https://www.tmz.com/2020/04/24/chernobyl-diaries-star-dimitri-diatchenko-dead-dies-52/ 'Chernobyl Diaries' Star Dimitri Diatchenko Dead at 52]</ref> (death announced on this date)\n*[[Mircea Mure\u0219an]], 91, Romanian film director (''[[R\u0103scoala]]'', ''[[Blestemul p\u0103m\u00e2ntului, blestemul iubirii]]'').<ref>[https://adevarul.ro/entertainment/film/a-murit-regizorul-mircea-muresan-ramas-definitiv-memoria-cinefililor-serialului-toate-panzele-sus-1_5ea2afc85163ec42711552a2/index.html A murit regizorul Mircea Mure\u015fan, r\u0103mas definitiv \u00een memoria cinefililor datorit\u0103 serialului \u201eToate p\u00e2nzele sus\u201c] {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Gerard Scholten|nl| Gerard Scholten (burgemeester)}}, 86, Dutch mayor and politician.<ref>[https://www.bd.nl/meierij/gerard-scholten-overleden-een-van-de-meest-schilderachtige-burgemeesters-van-schijndel~a6b936be Gerard Scholten overleden: een van de meest schilderachtige burgemeesters van Schijndel] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n*[[Vishnu Rasiah]], British neonatologist. <ref>[https://www.expressandstar.com/news/health/coronavirus-covid19/2020/04/24/birmingham-doctor-dies-after-undergoing-treatment-for-covid-19/ Leading West Midlands neonatal doctor dies after catching Covid-19]</ref> COVID-19\n*[[Lynn Faulds Wood]], 72, Scottish television presenter (''[[Watchdog (TV programme)|Watchdog]]'') and journalist, stroke.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52410491 Former Watchdog host Lynn Faulds Wood dies aged 72]</ref>\n*{{ill|Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara|it}}, 84, Italian businessman and football executive, Chairman of [[Bologna FC|Bologna]] (1993\u20132001).<ref>[https://www.tuttobolognaweb.it/news/il-saluto-del-bologna-a-gazzoni/?intcmp=gazzanet-bologna Il saluto del Bologna a Gazzoni] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n\n===23===\n*{{ill|Andy Ayunir|id}}, 53, Indonesian composer.<ref>[https://www.kompas.com/hype/read/2020/04/23/161729266/komposer-andy-ayunir-meninggal-dunia Komposer Andy Ayunir Meninggal Dunia] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Pahri Azhari|id}}, 57, Indonesian politician, [[Musi Banyuasin Regency|Musi Banyuasin]] regent (2008\u20132015), traffic collision.<ref>[https://sumsel.idntimes.com/news/sumsel/muhammad-rangga-erfizal/breaking-mantan-bupati-muba-pahri-azhari-meninggal-dunia/full Mantan Bupati Muba, Pahri Azhari Meninggal Dunia] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n*[[Norbert Bl\u00fcm]], 84, German politician, [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister for Social Affairs and Labour]] (1982\u20131998).<ref>[https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/norbert-bluem-frueherer-arbeitsminister-im-alter-von-84-jahren-gestorben-a-74ccbfb1-ce4f-4e06-b3d5-644ec7b31a23 Norbert Bl\u00fcm gestorben] {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n*[[Arief Budiman]], 79, Indonesian political activist and sociologist.<ref>[https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/04/23/arief-budiman-dissident-academic-under-new-order-dies-at-79.html Arief Budiman, dissident academic under New Order, dies at 79]</ref>\n*[[Chen Liangting]], 91, Chinese translator.<ref>[http://www.bjnews.com.cn/culture/2020/04/24/720657.html \u300a\u4e71\u4e16\u4f73\u4eba\u300b\u8bd1\u8005\u9648\u826f\u5ef7\u901d\u4e16\uff0c\u4eab\u5e7491\u5c81] {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n*[[Rinaldo Entingh]], 64, Surinamese footballer ([[S.V.

Mandakini is so sincere that she chides her father for arriving at the airport in his department vehicle. She gets delusioned by the corruption in India and resolves to put an end to it.\n\nKanwar Lal, a notorious criminal, is released from prison after serving a life sentence. His master and partners were killed years ago by Susheel Kumar, an undercover cop and Kanwar's lookalike. He meets Babu who gives him a shelter and aspires to follow his path. Kanwar meets a shrewd money minded middleman through whom he manages to make an unfriendly alliance with a few corrupt politicians.\n\nMaster Hirannaiah and his friend are social workers and theatre artists. They expose a few politicians' dirty world through their street plays. The politicians sent Kanwar to get them injured. Mandakini witnesses it and takes them to the hospital. They discover that they have the same ideals and decides to work as a team. Mandakini captures the videos and photos of the corrupt politicians in their dirty world while the Duo criticises the government through their plays and newspaper articles. The politicians upon finding the truth sends Kanwar and his gang to somehow take the video tapes and photos from her. He leaves after giving her a warning. Mandakini is advised by her father to stay away from the politicians and criminals and justifies his point by narrating the story of Kanwar's lookalike Susheel( the story of Antha ).After listening to her father she decides to bail out Susheel and devises a unique plan. \nShe manages to prove that Kanwar who was released recently is actually Susheel while the real Susheel is Kanwar. Thereby Susheel is bailed out while Kanwar is taken back to prison.\nUpon release Susheel kidnaps  Mandakini and her friends and takes them to an isolated building. He sells the photos and videos to the politicians for a hefty sum of 50lakhs( equivalent to 30 crores today). Susheel meets the middleman and organises a few goons after which he starts to form gangs by killing the major goons. This shocks everyone. Susheel later asks Kulwanth not to trace them since his daughter is in their custody. When Mandakini demands an explanation for the crimes committed by him, he says that he is on a mission to kill some unknown person who has become really powerful after he was jailed. He formed a nexus with the politicians so as to fight his rival. However Kulwanth traces them and sends police force to attack. Susheel and his gang overpowers them and Kulwanth gets killed by Susheel in the crossfire. Mandakini who witnesses her father's death curses and abuses Susheel. The trio claims that the major mistake they committed was that they helped to bail out Susheel. Susheel then reveals that his rival is the system of India and proclaims that he will go to any extent to eradicate corruption even if that means the death of his close friends . He begins the ''''' ''Operation Antha'' '''''.\n\nSusheel offers publicity to the mission by forcing the medias to showcase their views and acts against crimes. If an auto driver  refuses to take a pregnant woman to the hospital his leg his broken. A member of the black market has his eye plucked out and the police officers who attempts to rape a girl have their penis broken. The gang offers severe punishment for even the slightest crimes. The politicians who found this development alarming secretly manages to get Kanwar released from prison. Susheel releases the trio who gets shocked to see the change brought by Operation Antha and decides to support it. Meanwhile, Susheel travels to Mumbai for obtaining some weapons required for their mission. The politicians finding it as an excellent opportunity replaces Kanwar in place of Susheel by indicating that an accident occurred during the latter's journey. He crushes the mission and shows his face to the public through a TV channel thereby helping the police to identify the so-called anarchist.\n\nOn his return Susheel is startled to see the condition of Karnataka and happens to find that Kanwar is responsible for it. While trying to kill Mandakini for sending him to prison Kanwar is confronted by Susheel who kills him. However the politicians give the police the complete authority to terminate  Susheel and his gang. Susheel manages to escape in a helicopter promising to come back again.

Mandakini is so sincere that she chides her father for arriving at the airport in his department vehicle. She gets delusioned by the corruption in India and resolves to put an end to it.\n\nKanwar Lal, a notorious criminal, is released from prison after serving a life sentence. His master and partners were killed years ago by Susheel Kumar, an undercover cop and Kanwar's lookalike. He meets Babu who gives him a shelter and aspires to follow his path. Kanwar meets a shrewd money minded middleman through whom he manages to make an unfriendly alliance with a few corrupt politicians.\n\nMaster Hirannaiah and his friend are social workers and theatre artists.

He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] at the age of 44 in 1957, the second-youngest recipient in history.\n\nCamus was [[pied-noir|born in Algeria]] to French ''[[Pied-Noir|Pieds Noirs]]'' parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighborhood \nand later studied philosophy at the [[University of Algiers]]. He was in Paris when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] during [[World War II]] in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the [[French Resistance]] where he served as editor-in-chief at ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] that opposed the [[Soviet Union]] because of its [[totalitarianism]]. Camus was a [[Moralism|moralist]] and leaned towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. He was part of many organizations seeking European integration. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954 \u20131962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.\n\nPhilosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He is also considered to be an [[existentialist]], even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years and education===\n\n[[File:Algiers The University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighborhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sint\u00e8s Camus, was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-[[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] descent. His father, Lucien Camus, a poor French-Algerian agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus never knew him. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. He was a second-generation French immigrant to Algeria. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Africa for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French who were born in Algeria\u2014and his binational identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen, in contrast to the [[Arab]] or [[Berbers|Berber]] inhabitants of Algeria who were denied the associated privileges this brought.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, Camus developed a love for football and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, then a partner of a friend of Camus, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}}\n\n===Formative years===\nIn 1934, aged 20, Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hi\u00e9.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1986|1p=30|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|p=9}} Simone suffered from an addiction to [[morphine]], a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hi\u00e9 to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}} Camus was a womanizer throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=13}}\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]]. He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|1p=12|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===World War II, Resistance and ''Combat''===\n\nSoon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of [[World War II]] began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from ''Paris-Soir'' and ended up in [[Lyon]], where he married pianist and mathematician [[Francine Faure]] on 3 December 1940.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=13\u201314}} Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria ([[Oran]]) where he taught in primary schools.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=13}} Because of his tuberculosis, he moved to the French Alps after doctor's suggestion. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt\u2014a novel ''La Peste'' (''[[The Plague]]'') and a play ''Le Malentendu'' (''[[The Misunderstanding]]''). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and others. Among them was the actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], who would later have an affair with Camus.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|p=14|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}}\n\nCamus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the [[Occupation of France|French Occupation]]. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}} Camus used a pseudonym for his ''Combat'' articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death|Lettres \u00e0 un Ami Allemand]]'' (''Letters to a German Friend''), explaining why resistance was necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=15}}\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Albert Camus2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Albert Camus in the 1950s|Albert Camus in the 1950s]]\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nAfter the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean in 1945.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the novel ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''). Camus attacked [[totalitarian]] [[communism]] while advocating [[libertarian]] [[socialism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=17}} Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the [[Algerian War]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nCamus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organizations working towards that end.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1944, he founded the ''Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais pour la f\u00e9deration europ\u00e9enne''\u2014(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))\u2014declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1947\u201348, he founded the Groupes de liaison internationale (GLI) a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary [[syndicalism]] (\"syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire\").{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Schaffner|2y=2006|2p=107}} His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the [[Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet intervention in Hungary]] and the totalitarian tendencies of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime in Spain.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}}\n\nCamus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress Mar\u00eda Casares, with whom he had an extensive correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=14\u201317|2a1=Zaretsky|2y=2018}} Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalization in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}}\n\nIn 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography ''[[The First Man|Le Premier Homme]]'' (''The First Man'') in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}} Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The play opened in January 1959 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Antoine Theatre]] in Paris and was a critical success.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=18}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Camus's gravestone| Albert Camus's gravestone]] [[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

He had spent the New Year's holiday of 1960 at his house in [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]] with his family, and his publisher [[Michel Gallimard]] of [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]], along with his wife, Janine, and daughter. Camus's wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard's luxurious [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]]. The car crashed into a [[Platanus|plane tree]] on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the [[Route nationale 6|RN 6]]). Camus, who was in the passenger seat and not wearing a safety belt, died instantly.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Life}} Gallimard died a few days later, although his wife and daughter were unharmed.

Camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in Algeria would be his finest work.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Vaucluse, France, where he had lived. {{sfn|Bloom|2009|p=52}} His friend Sartre read a eulogy, paying tribute to Camus's heroic \"stubborn humanism\".{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Life}}\n\n==Literary career==\n\n[[File:Lucia 1957.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Camus crowning Stockholm's Lucia after accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature.|Camus crowning Stockholm's [[St Lucy's Day#In the Nordic countries|Lucia]] on 13 December 1957, three days after accepting the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nCamus's first publication was a play called ''[[R\u00e9volte dans les Asturies]]'' (''Revolt in the Asturias'') written with three friends in May 1936. The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, ''L'Envers et l'Endroit'' (''[[Betwixt and Between]]'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side''). Both were published by [[Edmond Charlot]]'s small publishing house.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=11}}\n \nCamus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ''L'\u00c9tranger'', ''Le Mythe de Sysiphe'', and ''Caligula''. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included ''La Peste'' (''The Plague''), ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel''), and ''Les Justes'' (''The Just Assassins''). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of ''Nemesis''. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp=41\u201344}}\n\nThe books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=23}} With this cycle, Camus aims to pose a question on the [[human condition]], discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=41}}\n\nCamus began his work on the second cycle while he was in [[Algeria]], in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=14}} In the second cycle, Camus used [[Prometheus]], who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, its connection to politics, and examines it under the lens of modernity, of [[historicity]] and the absence of a God.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at ''Actuelles III: Chronique alg\u00e9rienne 1939\u20131958'' (''Algerian Chronicles''). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess [[Nemesis]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}}\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first entitled ''La mort heureuse'' (''[[A Happy Death]]'') (1970), features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''The Stranger''{{'}}s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''Le Premier homme'' (''The First Man'') (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria and its publication in  1994 sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus's allegedly unrepentant colonialism.{{sfn|Carroll|2007}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Works of Camus by genre and cycle, <small>according to Matthew Sharpe{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=44}}</small>\n|-\n!

While he did not deny that morals change over time, he rejected the classical [[Marxist doctrine]] that history defines morality.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nCamus was also strongly critical of authoritarian communism, especially in the case of the Soviet regime, which he considered [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. Camus rebuked Soviet apologists and their \"decision to call total servitude freedom\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=75\u201376}} As a proponent of [[libertarian socialism]], he claimed the USSR was not socialist, and the United States was not liberal.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=185\u201387}} His fierce critique of the USSR caused him to clash with others on the political left, most notably with his friend Jean-Paul Sartre.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nActive in the [[French Resistance]] to the German occupation of France during World War II, Camus wrote for and edited the famous Resistance journal ''Combat''. Of the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers#France|French collaboration]] with the German occupiers, he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\"{{sfn|Bernstein|1997}} After France's liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a [[Talleyrand]], but a [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].\"{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}} The reality of the bloody [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|postwar tribunals]] soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}}\n\nCamus leaned towards anarchism, a tendency that intensified in the 1950s, when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt.{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1p=86|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=445}} Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authority and property, bosses, the State and centralization.{{sfn|Dunwoodie|1993|p=87}} Philosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an [[anarcho-syndicalist]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=185}} [[Graeme Nicholson]] considers Camus an [[Existentialist anarchism|existentialist anarchist]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1971|p=14}}\n\nThe anarchist [[Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting of the Cercle des \u00c9tudiants Anarchistes (\"Anarchist Student Circle\") in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''[[Le Libertaire]]'', ''[[La R\u00e9volution prol\u00e9tarienne]]'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (\"Workers' Solidarity\"), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) (\"National Confederation of Labor\").{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1pp=87-87|1ps=: See also appendix p 97|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=18}}\n\nCamus kept a neutral stance during the [[Algerian Revolution]] (1954\u201362). While he was against the violence of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France|Pierre Mend\u00e8s]]' [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU) and its approach to the crisis;\u00b7 Mendes advocated reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant, [[Aziz Kessous]]. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=17\u201318 & 188|2a1=Cohn|2y=1986|2pp=30 & 38}} His confrontation with an Algerian nationalist during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize caused a sensation. When confronted with the dilemma of choosing between his mother and justice, his response was: \"I have always condemned [[terrorism]], and I must condemn a terrorism that works blindly in the streets of Algiers and one day might strike at my mother and family. I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice.\"{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}} Camus' critics called it reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=584}} According to David Sherman, though, Camus tried to highlight the false dichotomy of the two choices as the use of terrorism and indiscriminate violence could not bring justice under any circumstances.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}}\n\nHe was sharply critical of the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear weapons]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=87}} In the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain, under the leadership of the [[caudillo]] General Francisco Franco, as a member.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}} Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment entitled ''[[R\u00e9flexions sur la peine capitale]]'', published by [[Calmann-Levy]] in 1957.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=73 & 85}}\n\n==Role in Algeria==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements fran\u00e7ais d'Alg\u00e9rie 1934-1955 map-fr.svg|thumb|alt=Map of French Algeria showing its administrative organization between 1905 and 1955 |Administrative organization of French Algeria between 1905 and 1955]]\n\nBorn in Algeria to French parents, Camus was familiar with the [[institutional racism]] of France against Arabs and Berbers, but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens' rights; the Arab and Berbers majority of the country were not.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nCamus was a vocal advocate of the \"new Mediterranean Culture\". This was a term he used to describe his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to \"Latiny\", a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other ''[[Pieds-Noirs]]''\u2014or French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=141-143}} His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus's most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the [[Blum\u2013Viollette proposal]] to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=145}} In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands. He advocated for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=356}}\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions, and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the \"new [[Arab imperialism]]\" led by Egypt, and an \"anti-Western\" offensive orchestrated by Russia to \"encircle Europe\" and \"isolate the United States\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=322}} Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=161}} His position drew much criticism from the left who considered colonialism unacceptable. In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nCamus once confided that the troubles in Algeria \"affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.\"{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=9}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Existentialism===\n\nEven though Camus is mostly connected to [[Absurdism]],{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=3}} he is routinely categorized as an [[Existentialist]], a term he rejected on several occasions.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=3}}\n\nCamus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy, [[Nietzsche]], and 17th-century moralists whereas existentialism arises from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Sharpe|2y=2015|2p=29}} He also said his work, ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=2}} Camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy, but his critique was mostly focused on [[Sartre]]an existentialism, and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom.{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=3}} David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=4|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Existentialism}}\n\nOn the other hand, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life, the inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in his acts. His belief that the absurd\u2014life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist\u2014was something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity, his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1pp=5\u20136|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} More importantly, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of [[suicide]]. He wrote: \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\" Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus's thoughts on the Absurd begins with his first cycle of books and the literary essay ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', (''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''), his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in ''L'\u00c9tranger''. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor [[Caligula]], pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between'') in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''[[Nuptials (Camus)|Nuptials]]''), in 1938 and ''Betwixt and Between''. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=23}} Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in ''The Plague''.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=8}}\n\nCamus follows Sartre's definition of the Absurd: \"That which is meaningless. Thus man's existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the \"confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\"{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=6}} Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=7-10}}\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Lib\u00e9ration'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libert\u00e9s'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''.\n\nCamus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus's Absurd\".{{sfn|Curtis|1972|p=335-348}}\n\n===Revolt===\n\nCamus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1p=18|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Revolt}} ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel'') explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd (described in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'') but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase \"I revolt, therefore we exist\" implying the recognition of a common human condition.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=55\u201356}} Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebel's revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime. So he places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=56\u201358}} Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner, in a silent universe? According to him the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=43\u201344}} Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is \"the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation.\" The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=50\u201355}}\n\n==Legacy==\nCamus's novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death, interest in Camus followed the rise (and diminution) of the [[New Left]]. Following the [[collapse of Soviet Union]], interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp= 241\u2013242}}\n\nAlthough Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism, reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism, some neo-liberals have tried to associate him with their policies, e.g. when the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] suggested that his remains to be moved to the [[Panth\u00e9on]], an idea that angered many on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zaretsky|1y=2013|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=208}}\n\n==Works==\nWorks of Albert Camus include:{{sfn|Hughes|2007|p=xvii}}\n===Novels===\n* ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (''L'\u00c9tranger'', often translated as ''The Outsider''.

He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] at the age of 44 in 1957, the second-youngest recipient in history.\n\nCamus was [[pied-noir|born in Algeria]] to French ''[[Pied-Noir|Pieds Noirs]]'' parents. He spent his childhood in a poor neighborhood \nand later studied philosophy at the [[University of Algiers]]. He was in Paris when the [[Battle of France|Germans invaded France]] during [[World War II]] in 1940. Camus tried to flee but finally joined the [[French Resistance]] where he served as editor-in-chief at ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', an outlawed newspaper. After the war, he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world. He married twice but had many extramarital affairs. Camus was politically active; he was part of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] that opposed the [[Soviet Union]] because of its [[totalitarianism]]. Camus was a [[Moralism|moralist]] and leaned towards [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. He was part of many organizations seeking European integration. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954 \u20131962), he kept a neutral stance, advocating for a multicultural and pluralistic Algeria, a position that caused controversy and was rejected by most parties.\n\nPhilosophically, Camus's views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He is also considered to be an [[existentialist]], even though he firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years and education===\n\n[[File:Algiers The University (GRI).jpg|thumb|alt=A postcard showing the University of Algiers|A 20th-century postcard of the University of Algiers]]\nAlbert Camus was born on 7 November 1913 in a working-class neighborhood in Mondovi (present-day [[Dr\u00e9an]]), in [[French Algeria]]. His mother, Catherine H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sint\u00e8s Camus, was of [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-[[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] descent. His father, Lucien Camus, a poor French-Algerian agricultural worker, died in the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in 1914 during [[World War I]]. Camus never knew him. Camus, his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Belcourt section of [[Algiers]]. He was a second-generation French immigrant to Algeria. His paternal grandfather, along with many others of his generation, had moved to Africa for a better life during the first decades of the 19th century. Hence, he was called {{lang-fr|[[pied-noir]]|label=none|lit='black foot'}}\u2014a slang term for French who were born in Algeria\u2014and his binational identity and his poor background had a substantial effect on his later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=10|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=7|3a1=Lottman|3y=1979|3p=11|4a1=Carroll|4y=2007|4pp=2\u20133}} Nevertheless, Camus was a French citizen, in contrast to the [[Arab]] or [[Berbers|Berber]] inhabitants of Algeria who were denied the associated privileges this brought.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=2\u20133}} During his childhood, Camus developed a love for football and swimming.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}}\n\nUnder the influence of his teacher Louis Germain, Camus gained a scholarship in 1924 to continue his studies at a prestigious [[lyceum]] (secondary school) near Algiers.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=8}} In 1930, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} Because it is a transmitted disease, he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle Gustave Acault, a butcher, who influenced the young Camus. It was at that time that Camus turned to philosophy, with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher [[Jean Grenier]]. He was impressed by [[ancient Greek philosopher]]s and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=11}} During that time, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the Meteorological Institute.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nIn 1933, Camus enrolled at the [[University of Algiers]] and completed his ''[[Licentiate (degree)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on [[Plotinus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sherman|2009|p=11|ps=: Camus' thesis was titled \"Rapports de l'hell\u00e9nisme et du christianisme \u00e0 travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian Thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\") for his ''dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).}}</ref> Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but Nietzsche and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as [[Stendhal]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Franz Kafka]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc=Background and Influences}} In 1933, he also met Simone Hi\u00e9, then a partner of a friend of Camus, who would become his first wife.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}}\n\nCamus played [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Racing Universitaire d'Alger]] junior team from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously.{{sfn|Lattal|1995}} In match reports, he was often praised for playing with passion and courage. Any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}} Camus drew parallels among football, human existence, morality, and personal identity. For him, the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and Church.{{sfn|Clarke|2009|p=488}}\n\n===Formative years===\nIn 1934, aged 20, Camus was in a relationship with Simone Hi\u00e9.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1986|1p=30|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|p=9}} Simone suffered from an addiction to [[morphine]], a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains. His uncle Gustave did not approve of the relationship, but Camus married Hi\u00e9 to help her fight her addiction. He subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=9}} Camus was a womanizer throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=13}}\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) in early 1935. He saw it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria,\" even though he was not a [[Marxist]]. He explained: \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\" Camus left the PCF a year later.{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=12}} In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Travail'' (\"Workers' Theatre\"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien ([[Algerian People's Party]] (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the [[interwar period]] escalated, the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Equipe (\"Theatre of the Team\"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn 1938, Camus began working for the leftist newspaper ''[[Alger r\u00e9publicain]]'' (founded by [[Pascal Pia]]) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative [[colonialism]] as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the [[Arab-Berber|Arabs]] and Berbers by French authorities. ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' was banned in 1940 and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his \"first cycle\" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless\u2014the novel ''L'\u00c9tranger'' (''The Outsider'' (UK), or [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']] (US)), the philosophical essay ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'') and the play ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]''. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|1p=12|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===World War II, Resistance and ''Combat''===\n\nSoon after Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of [[World War II]] began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from ''Paris-Soir'' and ended up in [[Lyon]], where he married pianist and mathematician [[Francine Faure]] on 3 December 1940.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=13\u201314}} Camus and Faure moved back to Algeria ([[Oran]]) where he taught in primary schools.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=13}} Because of his tuberculosis, he moved to the French Alps after doctor's suggestion. There he began writing his second cycle of works, this time dealing with revolt\u2014a novel ''La Peste'' (''[[The Plague]]'') and a play ''Le Malentendu'' (''[[The Misunderstanding]]''). By 1943 he was known because of his earlier work. He returned to Paris where he met and became friends with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He also became part of a circle of intellectuals including [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], and others. Among them was the actress [[Mar\u00eda Casares]], who would later have an affair with Camus.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|p=14|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}}\n\nCamus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the [[Occupation of France|French Occupation]]. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France.{{sfnm|1a1=Hayden|1y=2016|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=13}} Camus used a pseudonym for his ''Combat'' articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death|Lettres \u00e0 un Ami Allemand]]'' (''Letters to a German Friend''), explaining why resistance was necessary.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=15}}\n\n===Post-World War II===\n[[File:Albert Camus2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Albert Camus in the 1950s|Albert Camus in the 1950s]]\n{{external media| float = right| width = 230px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?97122-1/albert-camus-life Presentation by Olivier Todd on ''Albert Camus: A Life'', December 15, 1997], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n\nAfter the War, Camus lived in Paris with Faure, who gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean in 1945.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the Resistance. He gave lectures at various universities in the United States and Latin America during two separate trips. He also visited Algeria once more, only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies, which he had warned about many times. During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the novel ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''). Camus attacked [[totalitarian]] [[communism]] while advocating [[libertarian]] [[socialism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=17}} Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the [[Algerian War]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nCamus was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organizations working towards that end.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1944, he founded the ''Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais pour la f\u00e9deration europ\u00e9enne''\u2014(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))\u2014declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}} In 1947\u201348, he founded the Groupes de liaison internationale (GLI) a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary [[syndicalism]] (\"syndicalisme r\u00e9volutionnaire\").{{sfnm|1a1=Todd|1y=2000|1pp=249\u2013250|2a1=Schaffner|2y=2006|2p=107}} His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of Andr\u00e9 Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the [[Hungary\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet intervention in Hungary]] and the totalitarian tendencies of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime in Spain.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=18}}\n\nCamus had numerous affairs, particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish-born actress Mar\u00eda Casares, with whom he had an extensive correspondence.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=14\u201317|2a1=Zaretsky|2y=2018}} Faure did not take this affair lightly. She had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalization in the early 1950s. Camus, who felt guilty, withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}}\n\nIn 1957, Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This came as a shock to him. He was anticipating [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] would win the prestigious award. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography ''[[The First Man|Le Premier Homme]]'' (''The First Man'') in an attempt to examine \"moral learning\". He also turned to the theatre once more. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}} Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]''. The play opened in January 1959 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Antoine Theatre]] in Paris and was a critical success.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=18}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Camus's gravestone| Albert Camus's gravestone]] [[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|thumb|The bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

He had spent the New Year's holiday of 1960 at his house in [[Lourmarin]], [[Vaucluse]] with his family, and his publisher [[Michel Gallimard]] of [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]], along with his wife, Janine, and daughter. Camus's wife and children went back to Paris by train on 2 January, but Camus decided to return in Gallimard's luxurious [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]]. The car crashed into a [[Platanus|plane tree]] on a long straight stretch of the Route nationale 5 (now the [[Route nationale 6|RN 6]]). Camus, who was in the passenger seat and not wearing a safety belt, died instantly.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Life}} Gallimard died a few days later, although his wife and daughter were unharmed.

Camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in Algeria would be his finest work.{{sfn|Willsher|2011}} Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, Vaucluse, France, where he had lived. {{sfn|Bloom|2009|p=52}} His friend Sartre read a eulogy, paying tribute to Camus's heroic \"stubborn humanism\".{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Life}}\n\n==Literary career==\n\n[[File:Lucia 1957.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Camus crowning Stockholm's Lucia after accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature.|Camus crowning Stockholm's [[St Lucy's Day#In the Nordic countries|Lucia]] on 13 December 1957, three days after accepting the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nCamus's first publication was a play called ''[[R\u00e9volte dans les Asturies]]'' (''Revolt in the Asturias'') written with three friends in May 1936. The subject was the 1934 revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government resulting in 1,500 to 2,000 deaths. In May 1937 he wrote his first book, ''L'Envers et l'Endroit'' (''[[Betwixt and Between]]'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side''). Both were published by [[Edmond Charlot]]'s small publishing house.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=11}}\n \nCamus separated his work into three cycles. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay, and a play. The first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ''L'\u00c9tranger'', ''Le Mythe de Sysiphe'', and ''Caligula''. The second was the cycle of the revolt which included ''La Peste'' (''The Plague''), ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel''), and ''Les Justes'' (''The Just Assassins''). The third, the cycle of the love, consisted of ''Nemesis''. Each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp=41\u201344}}\n\nThe books in the first cycle were published between 1942 and 1944, but the theme was conceived earlier, at least as far back as 1936.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=23}} With this cycle, Camus aims to pose a question on the [[human condition]], discuss the world as an absurd place, and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=41}}\n\nCamus began his work on the second cycle while he was in [[Algeria]], in the last months of 1942, just as the Germans were reaching North Africa.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=14}} In the second cycle, Camus used [[Prometheus]], who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist, to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion. He analyses various aspects of rebellion, its metaphysics, its connection to politics, and examines it under the lens of modernity, of [[historicity]] and the absence of a God.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize, Camus gathered, clarified, and published his pacifist leaning views at ''Actuelles III: Chronique alg\u00e9rienne 1939\u20131958'' (''Algerian Chronicles''). He then decided to distance himself from the Algerian War as he found the mental burden too heavy. He turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess [[Nemesis]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=19}}\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first entitled ''La mort heureuse'' (''[[A Happy Death]]'') (1970), features a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''The Stranger''{{'}}s Meursault. There is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''Le Premier homme'' (''The First Man'') (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. It was an autobiographical work about his childhood in Algeria and its publication in  1994 sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus's allegedly unrepentant colonialism.{{sfn|Carroll|2007}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Works of Camus by genre and cycle, <small>according to Matthew Sharpe{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=44}}</small>\n|-\n!

While he did not deny that morals change over time, he rejected the classical [[Marxist doctrine]] that history defines morality.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nCamus was also strongly critical of authoritarian communism, especially in the case of the Soviet regime, which he considered [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. Camus rebuked Soviet apologists and their \"decision to call total servitude freedom\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=75\u201376}} As a proponent of [[libertarian socialism]], he claimed the USSR was not socialist, and the United States was not liberal.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=185\u201387}} His fierce critique of the USSR caused him to clash with others on the political left, most notably with his friend Jean-Paul Sartre.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\nActive in the [[French Resistance]] to the German occupation of France during World War II, Camus wrote for and edited the famous Resistance journal ''Combat''. Of the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers#France|French collaboration]] with the German occupiers, he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\"{{sfn|Bernstein|1997}} After France's liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a [[Talleyrand]], but a [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].\"{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}} The reality of the bloody [[\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale|postwar tribunals]] soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of [[capital punishment]].{{sfn|Bronner|2009|p=74}}\n\nCamus leaned towards anarchism, a tendency that intensified in the 1950s, when he came to believe that the Soviet model was morally bankrupt.{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1p=86|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=445}} Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authority and property, bosses, the State and centralization.{{sfn|Dunwoodie|1993|p=87}} Philosophy professor David Sherman considers Camus an [[anarcho-syndicalist]].{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=185}} [[Graeme Nicholson]] considers Camus an [[Existentialist anarchism|existentialist anarchist]].{{sfn|Nicholson|1971|p=14}}\n\nThe anarchist [[Andr\u00e9 Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting of the Cercle des \u00c9tudiants Anarchistes (\"Anarchist Student Circle\") in 1948 as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''[[Le Libertaire]]'', ''[[La R\u00e9volution prol\u00e9tarienne]]'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (\"Workers' Solidarity\"), the organ of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) (\"National Confederation of Labor\").{{sfnm|1a1=Dunwoodie|1y=1993|1pp=87-87|1ps=: See also appendix p 97|2a1=Hayden|2y=2016|2p=18}}\n\nCamus kept a neutral stance during the [[Algerian Revolution]] (1954\u201362). While he was against the violence of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist France. He was supportive of [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s France|Pierre Mend\u00e8s]]' [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU) and its approach to the crisis;\u00b7 Mendes advocated reconciliation. Camus also supported a like-minded Algerian militant, [[Aziz Kessous]]. Camus traveled to Algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1pp=17\u201318 & 188|2a1=Cohn|2y=1986|2pp=30 & 38}} His confrontation with an Algerian nationalist during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize caused a sensation. When confronted with the dilemma of choosing between his mother and justice, his response was: \"I have always condemned [[terrorism]], and I must condemn a terrorism that works blindly in the streets of Algiers and one day might strike at my mother and family. I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice.\"{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}} Camus' critics called it reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=19|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=584}} According to David Sherman, though, Camus tried to highlight the false dichotomy of the two choices as the use of terrorism and indiscriminate violence could not bring justice under any circumstances.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=191}}\n\nHe was sharply critical of the [[Nuclear proliferation|proliferation of nuclear weapons]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=87}} In the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain, under the leadership of the [[caudillo]] General Francisco Franco, as a member.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=17}} Camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual, and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment entitled ''[[R\u00e9flexions sur la peine capitale]]'', published by [[Calmann-Levy]] in 1957.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=73 & 85}}\n\n==Role in Algeria==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements fran\u00e7ais d'Alg\u00e9rie 1934-1955 map-fr.svg|thumb|alt=Map of French Algeria showing its administrative organization between 1905 and 1955 |Administrative organization of French Algeria between 1905 and 1955]]\n\nBorn in Algeria to French parents, Camus was familiar with the [[institutional racism]] of France against Arabs and Berbers, but he was not part of a rich elite. He lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of France and as such was entitled to citizens' rights; the Arab and Berbers majority of the country were not.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nCamus was a vocal advocate of the \"new Mediterranean Culture\". This was a term he used to describe his vision of embracing the multi-ethnicity of the Algerian people, in opposition to \"Latiny\", a popular pro-fascist and antisemitic ideology among other ''[[Pieds-Noirs]]''\u2014or French or Europeans born in Algeria. For Camus, this vision encapsulated the Hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=141-143}} His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus's most systematic statement of his views at this time. Camus also supported the [[Blum\u2013Viollette proposal]] to grant Algerians full French citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds. {{sfn|Hayden|2016|p=145}} In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the ''Alger r\u00e9publicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the [[Kabylie]] highlands. He advocated for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=356}}\n\nIn 1945, following the [[S\u00e9tif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony. He wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions, and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nWhen the Algerian War began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''Pieds-Noirs'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the \"new [[Arab imperialism]]\" led by Egypt, and an \"anti-Western\" offensive orchestrated by Russia to \"encircle Europe\" and \"isolate the United States\".{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=322}} Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war, he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians. It was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began working for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=161}} His position drew much criticism from the left who considered colonialism unacceptable. In their eyes, Camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed.{{sfn|Carroll|2007|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nCamus once confided that the troubles in Algeria \"affected him as others feel pain in their lungs.\"{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=9}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n===Existentialism===\n\nEven though Camus is mostly connected to [[Absurdism]],{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=3}} he is routinely categorized as an [[Existentialist]], a term he rejected on several occasions.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|p=3}}\n\nCamus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient Greek philosophy, [[Nietzsche]], and 17th-century moralists whereas existentialism arises from 19th- and early 20th-century philosophy such as [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Heidegger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Sharpe|2y=2015|2p=29}} He also said his work, ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=2}} Camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy, but his critique was mostly focused on [[Sartre]]an existentialism, and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism. He thought that the importance of history held by Marx and Sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom.{{sfnm|1a1=Foley|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=3}} David Sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between Sartre and Camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism.{{sfnm|1a1=Sherman|1y=2009|1p=4|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} David Simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]].{{sfn|Simpson|2019|loc= Existentialism}}\n\nOn the other hand, Camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions. The absurdity of life, the inevitable ending (death) is highlighted in his acts. His belief that the absurd\u2014life being void of meaning, or man's inability to know that meaning if it were to exist\u2014was something that man should embrace. His anti-Christianity, his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1pp=5\u20136|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc= Existentialism}} More importantly, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of [[suicide]]. He wrote: \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\" Camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life.{{sfn|Aronson|2017|loc=Introduction}}\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} Sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus's thoughts on the Absurd begins with his first cycle of books and the literary essay ''The Myth of Sisyphus'', (''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''), his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in ''L'\u00c9tranger''. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor [[Caligula]], pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between'') in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''[[Nuptials (Camus)|Nuptials]]''), in 1938 and ''Betwixt and Between''. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=23}} Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in ''The Plague''.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=8}}\n\nCamus follows Sartre's definition of the Absurd: \"That which is meaningless. Thus man's existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification\".{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=5\u20136}} The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the \"confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.\"{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=6}} Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.{{sfn|Foley|2008|p=7-10}}\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Lib\u00e9ration'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libert\u00e9s'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres \u00e0 un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''.\n\nCamus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe''. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus's Absurd\".{{sfn|Curtis|1972|p=335-348}}\n\n===Revolt===\n\nCamus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression, injustice, or whatever disrespects the human condition. He is cautious enough, however, to set the limits on the rebellion.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharpe|1y=2015|1p=18|2a1=Simpson|2y=2019|2loc=Revolt}} ''L'Homme r\u00e9volt\u00e9'' (''The Rebel'') explains in detail his thoughts on the issue. There, he builds upon the absurd (described in ''The Myth of Sisyphus'') but goes further. In the introduction, where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion, he concludes with the phrase \"I revolt, therefore we exist\" implying the recognition of a common human condition.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=55\u201356}} Camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebel's revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime. So he places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution.{{sfn|Foley|2008|pp=56\u201358}} Camus poses a crucial question: Is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner, in a silent universe? According to him the answer is yes, as the experience and awareness of the Absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=43\u201344}} Camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes. First, there is the metaphysical rebellion, which is \"the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation.\" The other mode, historical rebellion, is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world. In this attempt, the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries, and not cause any unjustifiable suffering.{{sfn|Hayden|2016|pp=50\u201355}}\n\n==Legacy==\nCamus's novels and philosophical essays are still influential. After his death, interest in Camus followed the rise (and diminution) of the [[New Left]]. Following the [[collapse of Soviet Union]], interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|pp=207\u2013208}} He is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance, dialogue, and civil rights.{{sfn|Sharpe|2015|pp= 241\u2013242}}\n\nAlthough Camus has been linked to anti-Soviet communism, reaching as far as anarcho-syndicalism, some neo-liberals have tried to associate him with their policies, e.g. when the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] suggested that his remains to be moved to the [[Panth\u00e9on]], an idea that angered many on the [[Left-wing politics|Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zaretsky|1y=2013|1pp=3\u20134|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=208}}\n\n==Works==\nWorks of Albert Camus include:{{sfn|Hughes|2007|p=xvii}}\n===Novels===\n* ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (''L'\u00c9tranger'', often translated as ''The Outsider''.

It offers a wide range of courses including A-levels, BTECs and Secretarial. It is now one of two campuses of USP College.\n\n===History===\n\nPalmer's was first opened in 1706 when the merchant William Palmer founded a [[charity school]] for \"ten poore children\" of the parish of Grays Essex, endowing it with valuable property in the town and Lombard Street in the City of London. Initially located in a small building inside the churchyard the school evolved into a boys' school. However, in response to the changing educational landscape initiated by the 1870 Education Act, the trustees of Palmer's charity re-launched the school on a new site on the hill above the town in 1874. To this a girls' school was added in 1876.<ref>Herbert Brooks, ''William Palmer and his School. Being an account of the founder of Palmer's Charity at Grays Thurrock, Essex'' (Colchester, 1928).</ref> The schools were [[grammar schools]] for both boys' and girls', and [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang]], perhaps Palmer's most distinguished alumnus, recalled it in 1905 as 'a modest establishment, modest that is in size and in material equipment, but not at all modest in the opinion which it held of itself'.<ref>Lord Strang, 'Fifty Years Ago', in J. R. Hayston (ed.), ''250 Years on. To commemorate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the trust deed by which William Palmer endowed in 1706 a school in Grays Thurrock'' (1956), p. 59. See also Strang's autobiography, ''Home and abroad'' (1956)</ref> The boy school which admitted both day pupils and boarders until 1970, achieved the status of a [[state school|public school]] in 1931\u201346. In 1972, as part of the reorganisation of education in Essex, the boys' and girls' schools amalgamated, together with Aveley Technical High School, to constitute a sixth form college. During the mid-1970s, the boys' and Aveley schools relocated to the College's present site (until then occupied by the Girls' School alone). The College was supported by the William Palmer College Education Trust, the direct successor of the trustees William Palmer appointed to administer his charity. Artifacts from the schools' past can be seen in the College library.\n\nA 2007 inspection by [[Ofsted]] concluded: \"Palmer's is an outstanding college.\" Student achievement and the standard of work were good and success rates overall 'well above national averages for learners from all backgrounds'. The College was also praised for its retention rates and value-added scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/40/130682|title=''2007 Palmers College Report'' - Ofsted May 2017|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a subsequent report rated the college as \"Requires Improvement\" because few students studying academic courses were achieving high grades, there were no consistent standards of teaching, learning and assessment, and the college's leadership had failed to maintain the high standards reached in 2007, with many of the implemented measures, particularly regarding the performance management of teachers, being ineffective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2319935/urn/130682.pdf |title=Further Education and Skills Inspection report: Palmer's College |date=18 November 2013 |publisher=[[Ofsted]]}}</ref>\n\n2008 saw a record number of students applying to the College with over 2000 students enrolling. The College was equipped with modern teaching facilities set in landscaped grounds. Both students and the general public had access to a newly refurbished sports and fitness centre (including gym), Palmer's hosts a variety of events for children from local schools on its playing fields.\n\nThe Student Executive were the \"voice of the students\" within the college; they were responsible for organising various college events. The Student Executive of 2007\u20132008 raised \u00a34,000 for Little Havens Children's Hospice while the Student Executive of 2008/9 raised \u00a33,000 for Cancer Research UK as well as hosting various social events and fundraising days over the course of the year.\n\nThe school had a good record of students attaining places on the prestigious [[Prime Minister's Global Fellowship]] programme. The school achieved its first two students in the inaugural year of the programme, 2008. In 2009 it had another successful applicant.<ref>British Council website [http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 \"Fellows\"] accessed 10 November 2009.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912082919/http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 |date=12 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Palmer's College celebrated its 300th anniversary and is able to trace its roots back over 300 years.\n\n===Location===\nThe college is situated on Chadwell Road (B149) next to the A1089 just north of the A126 junction (Marshfoot Interchange).<ref>https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/39601</ref> It is close to the boundary between [[Little Thurrock]] (to the west) and Chadwell St Mary.

It offers a wide range of courses including A-levels, BTECs and Secretarial. It is now one of two campuses of USP College.\n\n===History===\n\nPalmer's was first opened in 1706 when the merchant William Palmer founded a [[charity school]] for \"ten poore children\" of the parish of Grays Essex, endowing it with valuable property in the town and Lombard Street in the City of London. Initially located in a small building inside the churchyard the school evolved into a boys' school. However, in response to the changing educational landscape initiated by the 1870 Education Act, the trustees of Palmer's charity re-launched the school on a new site on the hill above the town in 1874. To this a girls' school was added in 1876.<ref>Herbert Brooks, ''William Palmer and his School. Being an account of the founder of Palmer's Charity at Grays Thurrock, Essex'' (Colchester, 1928).</ref> The schools were [[grammar schools]] for both boys' and girls', and [[William Strang, 1st Baron Strang]], perhaps Palmer's most distinguished alumnus, recalled it in 1905 as 'a modest establishment, modest that is in size and in material equipment, but not at all modest in the opinion which it held of itself'.<ref>Lord Strang, 'Fifty Years Ago', in J. R. Hayston (ed.), ''250 Years on. To commemorate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the trust deed by which William Palmer endowed in 1706 a school in Grays Thurrock'' (1956), p. 59. See also Strang's autobiography, ''Home and abroad'' (1956)</ref> The boy school which admitted both day pupils and boarders until 1970, achieved the status of a [[state school|public school]] in 1931\u201346. In 1972, as part of the reorganisation of education in Essex, the boys' and girls' schools amalgamated, together with Aveley Technical High School, to constitute a sixth form college. During the mid-1970s, the boys' and Aveley schools relocated to the College's present site (until then occupied by the Girls' School alone). The College was supported by the William Palmer College Education Trust, the direct successor of the trustees William Palmer appointed to administer his charity. Artifacts from the schools' past can be seen in the College library.\n\nA 2007 inspection by [[Ofsted]] concluded: \"Palmer's is an outstanding college.\" Student achievement and the standard of work were good and success rates overall 'well above national averages for learners from all backgrounds'. The College was also praised for its retention rates and value-added scores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/40/130682|title=''2007 Palmers College Report'' - Ofsted May 2017|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a subsequent report rated the college as \"Requires Improvement\" because few students studying academic courses were achieving high grades, there were no consistent standards of teaching, learning and assessment, and the college's leadership had failed to maintain the high standards reached in 2007, with many of the implemented measures, particularly regarding the performance management of teachers, being ineffective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2319935/urn/130682.pdf |title=Further Education and Skills Inspection report: Palmer's College |date=18 November 2013 |publisher=[[Ofsted]]}}</ref>\n\n2008 saw a record number of students applying to the College with over 2000 students enrolling. The College was equipped with modern teaching facilities set in landscaped grounds. Both students and the general public had access to a newly refurbished sports and fitness centre (including gym), Palmer's hosts a variety of events for children from local schools on its playing fields.\n\nThe Student Executive were the \"voice of the students\" within the college; they were responsible for organising various college events. The Student Executive of 2007\u20132008 raised \u00a34,000 for Little Havens Children's Hospice while the Student Executive of 2008/9 raised \u00a33,000 for Cancer Research UK as well as hosting various social events and fundraising days over the course of the year.\n\nThe school had a good record of students attaining places on the prestigious [[Prime Minister's Global Fellowship]] programme. The school achieved its first two students in the inaugural year of the programme, 2008. In 2009 it had another successful applicant.<ref>British Council website [http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 \"Fellows\"] accessed 10 November 2009.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912082919/http://www.global-fellowship.org/default.aspx?page=2 |date=12 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Palmer's College celebrated its 300th anniversary and is able to trace its roots back over 300 years.\n\n===Location===\nThe college is situated on Chadwell Road (B149) next to the A1089 just north of the A126 junction (Marshfoot Interchange).<ref>https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/39601</ref> It is close to the boundary between [[Little Thurrock]] (to the west) and Chadwell St Mary.

On May 5, 2012, after promoting [[Political positions of Gary Johnson|his libertarian-oriented political positions]] to delegates, Johnson received the most votes at the convention and became the official 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee. On November 6, 2012, Johnson received just under 1% of the popular vote in the [[2012 United States presidential election|general election]], amounting to more than 1.2 million votes, more than double what the [[Bob Barr presidential campaign, 2008|Barr/Root ticket]] received in 2008.  This was the most successful result for a third-party presidential candidacy since [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and the best in the Libertarian Party's history by vote number at the time.<ref name=\"million\">{{cite web | url=http://reason.com/blog/2012/11/07/gary-johnson-pulls-one-million-votes-one | title=Gary Johnson Pulls One Million Votes, One Percent | work=[[Reason.com]] | date=November 7, 2012 | accessdate=November 7, 2012 | author=Tuccile, J.D.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/11/08/Libertarian-Party-buoyant-Greens-hopeful/UPI-46151352363400/|title= Libertarian Party buoyant; Greens hopeful |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> Johnson [[Gary Johnson 2016 presidential campaign|ran again in 2016]] and received nearly four times his 2012 vote total.\n\n==Background==\nJohnson initially indicated interest in running for president in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-republic-strikes-back/|title=The Republic Strikes Back|magazine=[[The American Conservative]]|author=Bill Kauffman|accessdate= April 21, 2011|date=21 April 2009|author-link=Bill Kauffman}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.770kkob.com/Article.asp?id=1564031&spid=18042|title=Ex-Gov Mulls Presidential Bid|publisher=770 KKOB AM|author=24 Hour Newsroom|accessdate=April 21, 2011|date=27 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707070020/http://www.770kkob.com/Article.asp?id=1564031&spid=18042|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> In October of that year, he founded the [[Our America Initiative]], a [[501(c)(4)]] \"nonprofit political advocacy committee that promotes common-sense business approaches to governing.\" The stated focus of the organization was to \"...speak out on issues regarding topics such as government efficiency, lowering taxes, ending the war on drugs, protecting [[civil liberties]], revitalizing the economy and promoting entrepreneurship and privatization.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ouramericainitiative.com/about-the-initiative |title=Information from the official website for the Our America Initiative |publisher=Ouramericainitiative.com |accessdate=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429175654/http://ouramericainitiative.com/about-the-initiative |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref> The move prompted speculation among media pundits and Johnson's supporters as to whether he was laying the groundwork for a 2012 presidential run.<ref>Steve Terrell (October 26, 2009) [http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Group-wants-Johnson-back-on-ballot \"Group wants Johnson on presidential ballot\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120908125408/http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Group-wants-Johnson-back-on-ballot |date=2012-09-08 }}, ''Santa Fe New Mexican''.

He declared his candidacy for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican Party nomination]] for [[President of the United States]]. On December 28, 2011, Johnson withdrew his candidacy for the Republican nomination, and declared his candidacy for the 2012 presidential nomination of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. The [[2012 Libertarian National Convention]] was held during the first weekend of May 2012.
