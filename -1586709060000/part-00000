However, rules governing radio stations are less restrictive than those for television, allowing as many as six radio stations under common ownership in the largest U.S. [[media market]]s.<ref name=\"FCClocal\">{{cite web|title=FCC revives local television ownership rules|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/1999/nrmm9019.html|work=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|date=August 5, 1999}}</ref> Ownership of television stations with overlapping coverage areas was normally not allowed in the United States prior to 2002, even those that were not duopolies under the present legal definition, by way of being located in separate albeit adjacent markets; this required broadcasters to apply for cross-ownership waivers in some cases to retain full-power stations based in adjacent markets.<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC grant of request for waiver of the duopoly rule for WCAU-TV (Philadelphia) / WNBC (New York City)|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/News_Releases/nrmm5081.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=July 25, 1995}}</ref> [[Non-commercial educational]] broadcasters, mainly those that were [[Network affiliate#Member stations|members]] of the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), were the only licensees allowed to sign-on or acquire a second television station that did not repeat the parent station's signal in the same market where they already owned a station (some of these acquired stations were originally licensed as commercial outlets).\n\nOn August 5, 1999, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] voted 4-1 to allow common ownership of two television stations within a single market by one company,<ref>{{cite web|title=F.C.C.

The operations of the two stations are usually consolidated into one facility, depending on the size and age of the facility chosen to house their operations. Since the stations involved in the duopoly are not restricted by FCC law from consolidating their operations, duplicative jobs at one of the stations are often terminated as the consolidation takes effect.\n\nNews departments are also often consolidated into a singular operation, with anchoring and reporting staffs from the respective stations often being folded into one unit, subject to hiring determinations made by management; anchors and reporters are usually shared between the two stations, though in some cases, certain anchors may be employed to appear only on each station's own newscasts. In some cases (like with [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] and [[WLVI]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], when the former's owner [[Sunbeam Television]] formed a duopoly with WLVI after purchasing the station from [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in 2006), the junior partner's news department is shut down completely, with the senior partner subsequently taking over production of its news content using only their existing staff. In many cases, news programming on a junior partner is structured to avoid direct competition with a senior partner affiliate of either [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] or [[CBS]] (one notable exception involves [[WTTV]] and [[WXIN (TV)|WXIN]] in [[Indianapolis]], which carry competing morning and evening newscasts as Tribune Broadcasting opted to launch a separate slate of newscasts for WTTV when it became a CBS affiliate in January 2015,<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS affiliation switch means major changes at WTTV|url=http://www.ibj.com/cbs-affiliation-switch-means-major-changes-at-wttv/PARAMS/article/48994|author=Anthony Schoetle|work=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=August 11, 2014}}</ref> rather than shift those seen on sister [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate WXIN to the station; WXIN and WTTV largely maintain their own anchors, but share a news department and most reporting staff). This situation is uncommon in duopolies involving only [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] affiliates, as stations affiliated with those networks are more inclined to carry newscasts in overlapping time periods in order to fulfill local programming requirements included in affiliation agreements.\n\nCertain [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs are also shared between the stations, in the form of either same-day repeat airings of programs seen on the one which holds primary rights or separated runs of programs that air on each station, although each station maintains separate syndication inventories as well. The junior partner, unless it is affiliated with a major network, may also be used to carry network (and occasionally, first-run syndicated) programs that the senior partner is unable to broadcast because of long-form [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] coverage or a locally produced [[television special|special]] airing in a scheduled program's normal timeslot, or in the case of certain non-prime time network programs, because the senior partner chooses not to carry it on its regular schedule to carry other scheduled programming.\n\nAlthough the FCC bars common ownership of any of the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit duopolies involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four duopolies exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non-English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most duopolies are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) or an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed.\n\nOne of the few markets where two major network duopolies exist in some form is [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where two companies once owned the licenses of the Big Four stations they respectively controlled. In 2000, the [[Gannett Company]], owner of NBC affiliate [[WTLV]], purchased ABC affiliate [[WJXX]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/121399/bus_1h10TV25.html|title=Changing the channel|last=Patton|first=Charlie|date=December 13, 1999|work=The Florida Times-Union|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> which had struggled in the local ratings since its sign-on in February 1997 (when it took the ABC affiliation from [[WCWJ|WJKS]] through a [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment#Other station group deals|group affiliation deal]] with the [[Allbritton Communications Company]]) due to its status as a relatively new station and issues with signal interference from PBS station [[WJCT (TV)|WJCT]] on its [[Mediacom]] cable channel slot. The following year, [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] created a legal duopoly involving its existing Fox affiliate WAWS (now [[WFOX-TV]]) and WTEV-TV (now [[WJAX-TV]]), a [[UPN]] affiliate that it had been managing under a local marketing agreement since 1994; WTEV's viewership gradually rose after it became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, putting it in the top four threshold with WAWS, resulting in [[Newport Television]] \u2013 upon purchasing the Clear Channel television group in 2007 \u2013 restructuring the operation as a virtual duopoly by selling WTEV to shell licensee High Plains Broadcasting (WFOX and WJAX are now respectively owned by the [[Cox Media Group]] and Bayshore Television, LLC, but remain under common management though an LMA in which WJAX is the junior partner).\n\nThe use of [[digital subchannel]]s has been termed an \"instant duopoly,\" because of the ease by which a single digital station can deliver multiple channels of programming from different networks at the same time. One station can carry four or more [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] digital channels; multiple [[high-definition television|high definition]] feeds typically require too large a bitrate size to be carried on different subchannels of the same station simultaneously without loss of image quality.\n\n===Virtual duopolies===\nSome broadcasting companies have used [[loophole]]s to establish duopolies in smaller markets by way of a [[local marketing agreement|local marketing agreement, shared services agreement or joint sales agreement]]; where a station effectively [[Brokered programming|brokers]] its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales \u2013 and in effect, operations. These are termed as \"virtual duopolies\" as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps.<ref name=tvnc-wrongway>{{cite web|title=FCC Moving The Wrong Way On JSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/64074/fcc-moving-the-wrong-way-on-jsas|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|accessdate=September 27, 2014|date=2012-12-07}}</ref>\n\nSome larger broadcasting companies have controversially built business models around the practice, by funding the acquisition of stations by what are effectively [[shill]] companies or [[shell corporation]]s; for example, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] operates the stations of [[Cunningham Broadcasting]] and [[Deerfield Media]] under LMAs or SSAs. Nearly all of Cunningham's stock is held by trusts in the name of Sinclair's founders and owners, the Smith family.<ref>{{cite news|title=Family's TV Clout in Bush's Corner|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25406-2004Oct11.html|author=Howard Kurtz|author2=Frank Ahrens|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=A1|date=October 12, 2004}}</ref> Similarly, [[Nexstar Media Group]] funds the purchase of stations by [[Mission Broadcasting]], which forms duopolies with their stations through shared services agreements with a Nexstar station.<ref name=nyt-change>{{cite news|title=You Can Change the Channel, but Local News Is the Same|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/business/media/local-tv-stations-cut-costs-by-sharing-news-operations.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=business|author=Brian Stelter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> In some cases, the senior partner may acquire a station's physical assets and intellectual property (such as the station's facilities and programming rights), but spin off the license itself to a shell corporation and enter into an agreement to operate the station, making it the ''de facto'' owner, but not the legal owner. Following the purchase, the station's operations and programming are often merged into that of its new parent station.<ref name=nyt-change/><ref name=\"hsb-tvswap\">{{cite news|title=Execs explain TV swap, but some see it as blurry|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090820_Execs_explain_TV_swap_but_some_see_it_as_blurry|author=Erika Engle|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|publisher=Oahu Publications|date=August 20, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref> Similarly, a company that acquires an existing legal duopoly that is no longer complies with FCC rules on  duopoly ownership may spin off the junior partner station's license to a shell, rather than sell one of the stations to a licensee that would also assume operational responsibilities, allowing the restructured duopoly to remain under common operation through a resulting management agreement.\n\nIn some cases, the use of an adjacent-market [[city of license]] has been used on a secondary station to avoid a limit on the number of stations controlled by the same broadcaster in the same market. Occasionally, those arrangements cross international borders.

In areas with high [[cable television]] penetration, this distinction is essentially meaningless. LPTV stations were also exempt from [[Digital television transition in the United States|digital television transition]] requirements imposed on full-service broadcasters upon the June 2009 digital conversion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtv2009.gov/lowpower|title=Low Power}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=FCC consumer facts: Low Power television service|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/lptv.html|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=2011-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs such, low-power stations can also be formed to create duopolies; for instance, [[Weigel Broadcasting]] maintains triopolies in three markets surrounding the southern part of [[Lake Michigan]] ([[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]; and [[South Bend, Indiana]]) using a combination of full-power and low-power television stations. In Chicago, it maintains one full-power signal (independent station [[WCIU-TV]]) and two low-power stations ([[WWME-CD]] and [[WMEU-CA]], the flagship stations of the [[Me-TV]] digital subchannel network). In Milwaukee, Weigel has two full-power stations (CBS affiliate [[WDJT-TV]] and full-power independent station [[WMLW-TV]]) and two low-power stations (Me-TV station [[WBME-CD]] and [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WYTU-LD]], though the latter station uses a subchannel of WMLW as its main conduit for cable carriage). Weigel also takes advantage of digital subchannel broadcasting heavily and airs [[This TV]] in Milwaukee and South Bend, and [[Bounce TV]] in Chicago and Milwaukee; the company had also previously executed time share agreements on other subchannels with ethnic broadcasters, and in Milwaukee, a local real estate agency to air programming.\n\nA similar situation exists in [[Lima, Ohio]], where [[Block Communications]] controls a quadropoly of stations owned by itself ([[WLIO]], a full-powered NBC affiliate which also carries Fox and MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel) and low-power stations owned by West Central Ohio Broadcasting, Inc. (which owns ABC affiliate [[WPNM-LP]]/[[WOHL-CD]], and CBS affiliate [[WAMS-LP]]) under an LMA. One of the latter company's heads, Allan J. Block, is the chairman of Block Communications.<ref name=\"tvbr-mvptowcob\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11550.html|title=Phipps flips Lima low-power cluster|date=November 29, 2008|work=Television Business Report|accessdate=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601041600/http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11550.html|archivedate=June 1, 2009}}</ref> The group is the sole over-air provider of secular network television programming in the Lima market, though area cable systems also carry out-of-market affiliates from [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].\n\n==Canada==\n===Radio===\nIn radio, [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) policy generally allows broadcasters to operate no more than three radio stations in any given market, of which no more than two may be on the same radio band \u2014 that is, a company may own two AM stations and an FM station, or two FM stations and an AM station, but may not own three AMs or three FMs. However, in major metropolitan markets where a large number of radio stations are already broadcasting, the limit is increased to four stations with a maximum of two on each band. A company may also exceed these limits if it owns stations broadcasting in both English and French; for instance, in the [[Montreal]] media market, [[Bell Media Radio]] owns six radio stations, of which two operate in French and four in English.\n\n===Television===\nOfficially, CRTC policy mandates that a broadcaster may only own one television station in a particular language in any given market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2000-221 (para. 11)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-221.HTM|work=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|year=2000}}</ref> However, there are two types of exemptions which may be granted:\n# small markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to limited advertising revenue;\n# large markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to audience fragmentation or the cost of programming rights.\n\nThe policy does not prevent companies from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of \"exemption\". [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]/[[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9|Radio-Canada]] [[owned-and-operated station]]s (O&Os) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a \"commercial\" general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter airs advertising, as with [[CTV Two Alberta|Access]] in Alberta.<ref name=\"ctvchum\">{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165 (para. 29)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/eng/Decisions/2007/db2007-165.htm|work=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|year=2000|access-date=2013-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906100523/http://crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/2007/db2007-165.htm|archive-date=2008-09-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the small and large market exemptions have a financial criterion in common, there are notable differences between the two. A small market twinstick may involve major network affiliates licensed to the same community, and is not obligated to provide distinct local news programming on the two stations, while in a large market the stations must be licensed to serve different communities or different programming niches, and ''cannot'' merge their news programming into a single operation. Small market twinsticks commonly share their branding across both stations, while twinsticks in large markets generally do not. As well, while small market twinsticks generally involve private [[network affiliate|affiliate]]s, major market twinsticks are virtually always owned-and-operated stations of their associated networks or [[television system|systems]].\n\nIn a few isolated cases, the CRTC has permitted \"triple-sticks\", or [[triopoly (disambiguation)|triopolies]], where a single broadcaster operates ''three'' stations in a market. These are only possible under unusual circumstances which are discussed as they arise below.\n\n====History====\nTwinsticks were first allowed in 1967, as a way to help expand [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] service to smaller markets. In the original twinstick model, the second station was a rebroadcaster of a CTV station in a larger market, to which the small market's existing [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate would be granted the advertising sales rights.\n\nAs the company's advertising revenue grew, the CTV transmitter would eventually become an originating station in its own right, and in theory would eventually be sold to another broadcaster. However, in many cases the subsequent sale never happened, as the community's economic growth failed to lend itself to competition between multiple television broadcasters. In other markets where the CRTC had licensed competing broadcasters, such as [[Northern Ontario]], twinstick mergers were subsequently allowed to permit the survival of both television stations after similar economic difficulties were encountered.\n\nWith the cross-national [[concentration of media ownership|consolidation]] of media ownership, nearly all of the original twinstick stations no longer share ownership with their former twin stations. However, the second type of twinstick, involving media consolidation in larger markets, began to arise in the 1990s.\n\n====Small markets====\nUp until February 2010, twinsticks of this type outside of [[Quebec]] involved CTV and CBC Television affiliates. Currently both small-market twinsticks in English Canada consist of [[Global Television Network|Global]] and CTV affiliates.\n* [[Lloydminster]] \u2013 [[CITL-TV|CITL]] and [[CKSA-TV|CKSA]] ([[Newcap Broadcasting]])\n* [[Thunder Bay]] \u2013 [[CHFD-TV|CHFD]] and [[CKPR-TV|CKPR]] ([[Dougall Media]])\n\nWithin Quebec, twinsticks may consist of any combination of Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] and [[V (TV network)|V]] affiliates:\n* [[Gatineau]] \u2013 [[CHOT-DT|CHOT]] and [[CFGS-DT|CFGS]] ([[RNC Media]])\n* [[Rouyn-Noranda]] \u2013 [[CKRN-DT|CKRN]] and [[CFEM-DT|CFEM]] (RNC Media)\n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, CTV directly owned several CBC twinstick stations that it had inherited from [[Baton Broadcasting]] ([[CKNC-TV|CKNC]], [[CHNB-TV|CHNB]], [[CJIC-TV|CJIC]] and [[CFCL-TV|CFCL]] in Northern Ontario, which were part of the [[CTV Northern Ontario|MCTV]] system, and [[CKBI-TV|CKBI]] and [[CKOS-TV|CKOS]] in [[Saskatchewan]]); these were sold to the CBC in 2002.\n\nOne \"triple-stick\" also exists, in which a single company, [[T\u00e9l\u00e9 Inter-Rives]], operates all three licensed stations in [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]]: [[CKRT-TV|CKRT]], [[CIMT-TV|CIMT]] and [[CFTF-TV|CFTF]]. An unofficial triple-stick also exists in the Rouyn-Noranda area, as RNC Media, the licensed owner of that city's twinstick, also operates [[CFVS-DT|CFVS]], the sole station licensed to the nearby city of [[Val-d'Or]]; in actual practice, all three stations serve both cities. These unusual situations arise because of the unique circumstances of francophone television stations in Quebec: with virtually no sources for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]], the stations are effectively constrained to network programming at all times, and both TVA and Radio-Canada maintain direct editorial control of local newscasts on all of their affiliates{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!-- this may have been true of certain SRC affils in the past - e.g. those owned by TQS (for conflict-of-interest reasons) - but I don't think it was ever a requirement for all SRC or TVA affils --> \u2013 meaning that despite being owned by a single company, the stations are still able to meet the guiding principles behind the CRTC's policies on media ownership.\n\nAs noted above, historically, twinstick operations were locally owned. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership in Canada, however, most twinstick operations are now owned by major media conglomerates. The [[Thunder Bay Television]] stations (CHFD/CKPR) are the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada. The aforementioned T\u00e9l\u00e9 Inter-Rives is similarly unique in Quebec, although it is itself ''partially'' owned by [[Quebecor]].\n\nUntil August 2008, [[Cogeco]] owned three twinsticks in Quebec: [[CKTV-TV|CKTV]] and [[CFRS-TV|CFRS]] in [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[CKSH-TV|CKSH]] and [[CFKS-TV|CFKS]] in [[Sherbrooke]] and [[CKTM-TV|CKTM]] and [[CFKM-TV|CFKM]] in [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]. These twinsticks were dissolved when Radio-Canada decided to acquire its former affiliates (CKTV, CKSH and CKTM), while the V affiliates (CFRS, CFKS and CFKM) were acquired by [[Remstar Corporation]], the new owner of V (then known as TQS).\n\n====Major markets====\nIn the mid-1990s, the CRTC also began to allow private companies operating in large markets to acquire smaller stations. In all such cases, the twinsticks are permitted because a diversity of broadcast voices already exists in the market,<ref>{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2000-221 (para. 12)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-221.HTM|work=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|year=2000}}</ref> and the stations are normally licensed to serve different communities in the metropolitan market or different programming niches. The stations must also be operated independently of each other, although they are permitted to cross-promote each other's programming. They may also air a very limited amount of common programming, although in practice this privilege is rarely used.\n\nCurrently, [[Bell Media]] operates twinsticks in three major markets, using the CTV and [[CTV Two]] brands:\n* [[Ottawa]] \u2013 [[CJOH-DT|CJOH]] and [[CHRO-DT|CHRO]]\n* [[Toronto]]-[[Barrie]] \u2013 [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] and [[CKVR-DT|CKVR]]\n* [[Vancouver]]-[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] \u2013 [[CIVT-DT|CIVT]] and [[CIVI-DT|CIVI]]\n\nIn addition to these \"true\" twinsticks, in some areas, Bell Media has taken a twinstick-type approach with two stations deemed to be in ''adjacent'' media markets, but which in practice serve both markets. For example, Bell operates both CTV station [[CKCO-DT]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] and CTV Two station [[CFPL-DT]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], about {{convert|100|km|mi}} away. Both have been carried on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band of basic cable throughout much of [[southwestern Ontario]] for several decades. Hence, presumably as a result of this duplicated coverage, their current owner has elected to continue airing distinct programming on both stations (on the other hand, Kitchener is also about 100&nbsp;km from Toronto; nevertheless both CKCO and Toronto's CFTO operate as CTV stations).\n\nFinally, in some markets, Bell Media operates both a local over-the-air CTV station, and a provincial or regional cable channel that broadcasts CTV Two programming. In Alberta, CTV stations [[CFCN-DT|CFCN]] in [[Calgary]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN]] in [[Edmonton]] co-exist with [[CTV Two Alberta]], which is officially licensed as the provincial educational broadcaster and is therefore technically exempt from the CRTC's common ownership policy<ref name=\"ctvchum\"/> (prior to September 2011, CTV Two Alberta also operated over-the-air transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton). In the [[Maritime Provinces]], Bell Media operates both the over-the-air [[CTV Atlantic]] group of stations and the cable-only [[CTV Two Atlantic]], which have been jointly owned (under various parent companies) since the latter's launch in 1983.\n\n====Previous examples====\n[[Canwest]]<!-- Shaw is not applicable here; Canwest divested all of the \"secondary\" stations before Shaw ever got control of it. --> operated the [[CIII-DT|CIII]]/[[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] twinstick in Toronto-[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and the [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]]/[[CHEK-DT|CHEK]] twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria until 2009, under the [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] brands. These two sets of twinsticks were separated as a result of E!'s demise in August 2009, with Canwest retaining the Global O&Os (CIII and CHAN) and selling off the E! stations (CHCH and CHEK). Additionally, Canwest previously owned the now-defunct [[CHCA-TV|CHCA]] in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], which was available on cable and via rebroadcast transmitters in both Calgary and Edmonton, where Canwest respectively already owned [[CICT-DT|CICT]] and [[CITV-DT|CITV]]. This was not considered a true twinstick as CHCA was not based in the larger markets, and did not have permission to solicit local advertising in those markets. It did, however, have [[simultaneous substitution]] rights.\n\n[[CHUM Television]] operated the [[CITY-DT|CITY]]/CKVR twinstick in Toronto-Barrie and the [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]]/CIVI twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria under the [[Citytv]] and [[CTV Two|A-Channel]] brands prior to its acquisition by [[CTVglobemedia]] in 2006. Following this acquisition, [[Rogers Media]] briefly held twinsticks in Vancouver (CKVU and [[CHNU-DT|CHNU]]) and Winnipeg ([[CHMI-DT|CHMI]] and [[CIIT-DT|CIIT]]), formed from its newly acquired Citytv stations and its [[Omni Television|Omni]]-branded religious stations; these two sets of twinsticks were dissolved in 2008 following the sales of CHNU and CIIT to [[S-VOX]].\n\nUnlike the situation in smaller markets, this type of \"[[concentration of media ownership|consolidation]]\" twinstick had been increasingly common up to the late 2000s, concurrently with the rise of secondary television systems (such as CH/E! and A-Channel) launched by their parent companies to complement their primary networks or systems (such as Global and Citytv). This trend was partially reversed in 2009 with the demise of E! and the subsequent dissolution of the Global/E! twinsticks.\n\n====Multiple languages====\nIn many major markets, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] operates both [[CBC Television]] (English) and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]] (French) stations, as listed below. Prior to the CBC decommissioning all of its television rebroadcasters in 2012, both networks were available over-the-air in numerous other markets not listed below, but one or both of the transmitters was a rebroadcaster of a station originating in a different city; these were not usually considered true twinsticks. Nevertheless, both networks continue to be available as part of the basic programming tier on all cable and satellite providers nationwide.\n* [[Edmonton]] \u2013 [[CBXT-DT|CBXT]] and [[CBXFT-DT|CBXFT]]\n* [[Montreal]] \u2013 [[CBMT-DT|CBMT]] and [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]]\n* Ottawa \u2013 [[CBOT-DT|CBOT]] and [[CBOFT-DT|CBOFT]]\n* [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] \u2013 [[CBKT-DT|CBKT]] and [[CBKFT]]\n* Toronto \u2013 [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] and [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT]]\n* Vancouver \u2013 [[CBUT-DT|CBUT]] and [[CBUFT-DT|CBUFT]]\n* [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] \u2013 [[CBET-DT|CBET]] and [[CBEFT]]\n* [[Winnipeg]] \u2013 [[CBWT-DT|CBWT]] and [[CBWFT-DT|CBWFT]]\n\nIn Toronto, Edmonton and [[Calgary]], Rogers Media's acquisition of the Citytv system put those stations in twinsticks with the multilingual [[Omni Television]] stations. In Toronto, Omni Television has its own twinstick, giving the company a nominal \"triple-stick\" in that market. The two Omni stations in Toronto each serve different segments of the market's multicultural audience, and thus are ''also'' permitted under the language exemption.\n* [[Calgary]] \u2013 [[CKAL-DT|CKAL]] and [[CJCO-DT|CJCO]]\n* Edmonton \u2013 [[CKEM-DT|CKEM]] and [[CJEO-DT|CJEO]]\n* Toronto \u2013 [[CFMT-DT|CFMT]], [[CJMT-DT|CJMT]] and [[CITY-DT|CITY]]\n* Vancouver \u2013 [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] and [[CHNM-DT|CHNM]]\n\nIn Montreal, Canwest owned both Global station [[CKMI-DT|CKMI]] and multicultural station [[CJNT-DT|CJNT]] until August 2009, when the latter was sold to [[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]].\n\nCTV was formerly a part-owner of the francophone [[V (TV network)|V]] network (formerly TQS) in Quebec, meaning that V's owned-and-operated [[CFJP-DT|CFJP]] in Montreal was a partial twinstick with CTV's [[CFCF-DT|CFCF]] for most of the 2000s. CFCF was, in fact, the original ''owner'' of TQS, meaning that the stations were once a true twinstick under the language exemption, although the two stations went through very different sequences of ownership changes after 1995.\n\n==Triopolies and quadropolies==\n[[NBCUniversal]] formerly owned three full-power stations in [[Los Angeles]], NBC owned-and-operated station [[KNBC]], [[Telemundo]] O&O [[KVEA]] and [[Spanish language]] independent station [[KWHY-TV]], before selling KWHY to the [[Alex Meruelo|Meruelo Group]] in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC decision on transfer of existing Telemundo O&O stations to NBC-Telemundo's TN Acquisition Corp|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Orders/2002/fcc02113r.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission|year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Universal to Sell LA Station KWHY-TV to Meruelo|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nbc-universal-sell-la-station-76275|author=George Szalai|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref> The FCC allows common ownership of three full-power television stations if there are 18 stations that are licensed within the market; as such, Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] are the only two U.S. markets which can legally have a true full-power triopoly,<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC adopts media ownership rules|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/06/02/news/companies/fcc_rules/|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=June 2, 2003}}</ref> though Sinclair owns a legal triopoly in [[Salt Lake City]] with CBS affiliate [[KUTV]], independent station [[KJZZ-TV]], and MyNetworkTV station [[KMYU]].\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission otherwise only permits common ownership of three full-power television stations within one market if the tertiary station is licensed under a [[broadcast relay station#satellite station|satellite station]] waiver (the FCC constitutes a full-power station that is licensed as a satellite as the same entity as its parent station, and therefore does not count them toward market ownership caps). A unique instance exists in [[Austin, Texas]], involving the ''de facto'' triopoly of NBC affiliate [[KXAN-TV]], CW affiliate [[KNVA]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KBVO (TV)|KBVO]], the latter of which signed on in 1991 as a [[Llano, Texas|Llano]]-based satellite of KXAN to serve western portions of the market where reception of that station's UHF signal was impaired by the [[Texas Hill Country|hilly terrain]] within the area. Even though KBVO was converted into a separately programmed station in October 2009 (and therefore no longer acts as a KXAN repeater, even by way of a subchannel), the FCC granted Media General permission to acquire its license under an existing satellite waiver during that company's merger with [[LIN Media]] in 2014<ref>{{cite web|title=Consent to Transfer Control of Licenses by Shareholders of Media General, Inc. and Shareholders of LIN Media, LLC to Post-Merger Shareholders of Media General, Inc.|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-14-1810A1.docx|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> (without the waiver, Media General/LIN would have been forced to sell either KBVO or KNVA, which would not have been viable in any event, since there are not enough unique full-power station owners in the Austin market to permit a second legal duopoly with an owner of one of the market's three English language [[KTBC (TV)|major]] [[KVUE|network]] [[KEYE-TV|affiliates]] and neither would have likely had long-term financial survivability as a standalone station).\n\nIn addition, the FCC permits common ownership of three television stations if there are low-powered stations that are involved.\n\nIn 2013, through its acquisition of stations from [[Newport Television]], Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a full-power virtual quadropoly made up of two legal duopolies in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], consisting of NBC affiliate [[KARK-TV]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KARZ-TV]] (which Nexstar already owned), and Fox affiliate [[KLRT-TV]] and CW affiliate [[KASN]] (another existing duopoly that was acquired by Mission).

Unlike the quadropoly in Little Rock, Sinclair has not consolidated all four stations into one facility and each duopoly maintains their own studios in different parts of the market (WEAR/WFGX on the Florida side, WPMI/WJTC on the Alabama side). Similarly structured virtual triopolies (many of which are run by Nexstar and Sinclair) also exist in a few markets, in which either an existing owner-operator of a legal duopoly also manages a tertiary station owned by a separate if indirectly related licensee, or owns-operates one station and runs two others that are owned by different licensees.\n\nIn Canada, at least one community ([[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]], [[Quebec]]) has all three of its local [[French language]] stations \u2013 [[CKRT-DT]], [[CIMT-DT]] and [[CFTF-DT]] \u2013 under common ownership, however such levels of common ownership are for the most part strongly discouraged by the CRTC unless the stations serve remote communities or separately carry programming in different languages (such as Rogers Media's aforementioned triopoly in Toronto, consisting of the English-language CITY-DT and multicultural stations CFMT-DT and CJMT-DT).\n\nIn Mexico, media concentration is endemic and it is not uncommon for as many as four stations to be operated by one entity. [[Televisa]] owns four [[Mexico City]] stations ([[XEW-TV|XEW]], [[XHTV-TV|XHTV]], [[XHGC-TV|XHGC]] and [[XEQ-TV|XEQ]]) while [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|Azteca]], Mexico's second-largest broadcaster, owns three ([[XHIMT-TV|XHIMT]], [[XHDF-TV|XHDF]] and [[XHTVM-TV|XHTVM]]). These stations, in turn, feed large numbers of full-power affiliates. The largest Mexican network is the Televisa-owned [[Canal de las Estrellas]], which feeds its programming to more than 100 stations nationwide.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trimulcast]]\n* [[Concentration of media ownership]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duopoly (Broadcasting)}}\n[[Category:Broadcast law]]\n[[Category:Concentration of media ownership]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:United States communications regulation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Ownership of multiple broadcast stations in the same community}}\nA '''duopoly''' (or '''twinstick''', referring to \"stick\" as [[jargon]] for a [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]]) is a situation in [[terrestrial television|television]] and [[radio industry|radio]] broadcasting in which two or more stations in the same city or community share [[common ownership]].\n\n==United States==\nIn the [[United States]], the practice of duopolies has been frowned upon when using public airwaves, on the premise that it gives too much influence to one company.

The operations of the two stations are usually consolidated into one facility, depending on the size and age of the facility chosen to house their operations. Since the stations involved in the duopoly are not restricted by FCC law from consolidating their operations, duplicative jobs at one of the stations are often terminated as the consolidation takes effect.\n\nNews departments are also often consolidated into a singular operation, with anchoring and reporting staffs from the respective stations often being folded into one unit, subject to hiring determinations made by management; anchors and reporters are usually shared between the two stations, though in some cases, certain anchors may be employed to appear only on each station's own newscasts. In some cases (like with [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] and [[WLVI]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], when the former's owner [[Sunbeam Television]] formed a duopoly with WLVI after purchasing the station from [[Tribune Broadcasting]] in 2006), the junior partner's news department is shut down completely, with the senior partner subsequently taking over production of its news content using only their existing staff. In many cases, news programming on a junior partner is structured to avoid direct competition with a senior partner affiliate of either [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]] or [[CBS]] (one notable exception involves [[WTTV]] and [[WXIN (TV)|WXIN]] in [[Indianapolis]], which carry competing morning and evening newscasts as Tribune Broadcasting opted to launch a separate slate of newscasts for WTTV when it became a CBS affiliate in January 2015,<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS affiliation switch means major changes at WTTV|url=http://www.ibj.com/cbs-affiliation-switch-means-major-changes-at-wttv/PARAMS/article/48994|author=Anthony Schoetle|work=[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=August 11, 2014}}</ref> rather than shift those seen on sister [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate WXIN to the station; WXIN and WTTV largely maintain their own anchors, but share a news department and most reporting staff). This situation is uncommon in duopolies involving only [[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] affiliates, as stations affiliated with those networks are more inclined to carry newscasts in overlapping time periods in order to fulfill local programming requirements included in affiliation agreements.\n\nCertain [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs are also shared between the stations, in the form of either same-day repeat airings of programs seen on the one which holds primary rights or separated runs of programs that air on each station, although each station maintains separate syndication inventories as well. The junior partner, unless it is affiliated with a major network, may also be used to carry network (and occasionally, first-run syndicated) programs that the senior partner is unable to broadcast because of long-form [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] coverage or a locally produced [[television special|special]] airing in a scheduled program's normal timeslot, or in the case of certain non-prime time network programs, because the senior partner chooses not to carry it on its regular schedule to carry other scheduled programming.\n\nAlthough the FCC bars common ownership of any of the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit duopolies involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four duopolies exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non-English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most duopolies are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) or an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed.\n\nOne of the few markets where two major network duopolies exist in some form is [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where two companies once owned the licenses of the Big Four stations they respectively controlled. In 2000, the [[Gannett Company]], owner of NBC affiliate [[WTLV]], purchased ABC affiliate [[WJXX]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/121399/bus_1h10TV25.html|title=Changing the channel|last=Patton|first=Charlie|date=December 13, 1999|work=The Florida Times-Union|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> which had struggled in the local ratings since its sign-on in February 1997 (when it took the ABC affiliation from [[WCWJ|WJKS]] through a [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment#Other station group deals|group affiliation deal]] with the [[Allbritton Communications Company]]) due to its status as a relatively new station and issues with signal interference from PBS station [[WJCT (TV)|WJCT]] on its [[Mediacom]] cable channel slot. The following year, [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] created a legal duopoly involving its existing Fox affiliate WAWS (now [[WFOX-TV]]) and WTEV-TV (now [[WJAX-TV]]), a [[UPN]] affiliate that it had been managing under a local marketing agreement since 1994; WTEV's viewership gradually rose after it became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, putting it in the top four threshold with WAWS, resulting in [[Newport Television]] \u2013 upon purchasing the Clear Channel television group in 2007 \u2013 restructuring the operation as a virtual duopoly by selling WTEV to shell licensee High Plains Broadcasting (WFOX and WJAX are now respectively owned by the [[Cox Media Group]] and Bayshore Television, LLC, but remain under common management though an LMA in which WJAX is the junior partner).\n\nThe use of [[digital subchannel]]s has been termed an \"instant duopoly,\" because of the ease by which a single digital station can deliver multiple channels of programming from different networks at the same time. One station can carry four or more [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] digital channels; multiple [[high-definition television|high definition]] feeds typically require too large a bitrate size to be carried on different subchannels of the same station simultaneously without loss of image quality.\n\n===Virtual duopolies===\nSome broadcasting companies have used [[loophole]]s to establish duopolies in smaller markets by way of a [[local marketing agreement|local marketing agreement, shared services agreement or joint sales agreement]]; where a station effectively [[Brokered programming|brokers]] its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales \u2013 and in effect, operations. These are termed as \"virtual duopolies\" as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps.<ref name=tvnc-wrongway>{{cite web|title=FCC Moving The Wrong Way On JSAs|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/64074/fcc-moving-the-wrong-way-on-jsas|website=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheckMedia|accessdate=September 27, 2014|date=2012-12-07}}</ref>\n\nSome larger broadcasting companies have controversially built business models around the practice, by funding the acquisition of stations by what are effectively [[shill]] companies or [[shell corporation]]s; for example, [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] operates the stations of [[Cunningham Broadcasting]] and [[Deerfield Media]] under LMAs or SSAs.

Following the purchase, the station's operations and programming are often merged into that of its new parent station.<ref name=nyt-change/><ref name=\"hsb-tvswap\">{{cite news|title=Execs explain TV swap, but some see it as blurry|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090820_Execs_explain_TV_swap_but_some_see_it_as_blurry|author=Erika Engle|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|publisher=Oahu Publications|date=August 20, 2009|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}</ref> Similarly, a company that acquires an existing legal duopoly that is no longer complies with FCC rules on  duopoly ownership may spin off the junior partner station's license to a shell, rather than sell one of the stations to a licensee that would also assume operational responsibilities, allowing the restructured duopoly to remain under common operation through a resulting management agreement.\n\nIn some cases, the use of an adjacent-market [[city of license]] has been used on a secondary station to avoid a limit on the number of stations controlled by the same broadcaster in the same market. Occasionally, those arrangements cross international borders. For instance, [[radio station]] [[WLYK]] in [[Cape Vincent (town), New York|Cape Vincent, New York]] in the United States is operated from the Canadian studios of [[Kingston, Ontario]]'s [[CIKR-FM]], a broadcaster already at the two-station limit in its own market, under an LMA.<ref>{{cite web|title=102.7 The Lake WLYK|url=http://www.1027thelake.com/page/feedback.html|access-date=2008-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213233441/http://www.1027thelake.com/page/feedback.html|archive-date=2008-12-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> Broadcasters such as [[Entravision Communications Corporation|Entravision]] have often entered into local marketing agreements with Mexican border stations (such as [[Tecate]]'s [[XHDTV-TDT]] for content directed at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]).\n\n===Failing station waivers===\nIt is also possible to obtain a \"failing station waiver,\" which can exempt a broadcaster from some portion of the existing restrictions on common ownership in order to acquire and operate a station which otherwise would be economically non-viable or would be forced to [[dark (broadcasting)|cease operations]].\n\nRequests for failing station waivers have historically met with variable reception; in general, a prospective buyer is on the same wavelength with the FCC on failing-station policies if it can demonstrate to the Commission that:\n* The failing station consistently received less than 4% of all local all-day audience share;\n* the station is in poor financial condition, normally operating at a loss for at least the previous three years;\n* the merger will produce public interest benefits, and;\n* the in-market buyer is the only suitable candidate as a sale to an out-of-market buyer would result in an artificially depressed price.<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC application to assign the license for KNIN-TV (CW 9 Caldwell, Idaho) to Journal Broadcast Corp (KIVI-TV)|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2008/db1110/DA-08-2471A1.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWaivers under these criteria were granted to sell [[WASV-TV]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] to [[Media General]], owner of CBS affiliate [[WSPA-TV]] in that market,<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC application for assignment of WASV-TV, Asheville, North Carolina|url=http://ftp.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2002/da020103.pdf|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=January 15, 2002|access-date=November 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926101902/http://ftp.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2002/da020103.pdf|archive-date=September 26, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[KWBA-TV|KWBA]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] to the [[Journal Communications|Journal Broadcast Group]], owner of that market's ABC affiliate [[KGUN-TV]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Epic fail: FCC gives Tucson a \"failing station\" TV duopoly|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080603-epic-fail-fcc-gives-tucson-a-failing-station-tv-duopoly.html|author=Matthew Lasar|work=ArsTechica|date=June 3, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=FCC green lights sale of KWBA to KGUN owner|url=http://www.azbiz.com/articles/2008/06/06/media_technology/inside_media/doc48497d44733b5027858362.txt|author=David Hatfield|work=Inside Tucson Business|date=June 6, 2008}}</ref> A similar waiver was refused to [[KNIN-TV]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] as the station, a CW affiliate at the time the waiver application was filed, appeared to have reasonable prospects of financial break-even without a takeover by Journal-owned ABC affiliate [[KIVI-TV]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Journal Boise duop dropped|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11178.html|work=Radio-Television Business Report|date=November 9, 2008|access-date=November 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716144435/http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/tv_deals/11178.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> that decision was subsequently appealed, with the waiver being granted upon further review (Journal Broadcast Group would eventually be required to sell KNIN in 2014, as the station's financial condition improved enough in its post-2011 existence as a Fox affiliate to make it unsuitable for the [[E.

In Chicago, it maintains one full-power signal (independent station [[WCIU-TV]]) and two low-power stations ([[WWME-CD]] and [[WMEU-CA]], the flagship stations of the [[Me-TV]] digital subchannel network). In Milwaukee, Weigel has two full-power stations (CBS affiliate [[WDJT-TV]] and full-power independent station [[WMLW-TV]]) and two low-power stations (Me-TV station [[WBME-CD]] and [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[WYTU-LD]], though the latter station uses a subchannel of WMLW as its main conduit for cable carriage). Weigel also takes advantage of digital subchannel broadcasting heavily and airs [[This TV]] in Milwaukee and South Bend, and [[Bounce TV]] in Chicago and Milwaukee; the company had also previously executed time share agreements on other subchannels with ethnic broadcasters, and in Milwaukee, a local real estate agency to air programming.\n\nA similar situation exists in [[Lima, Ohio]], where [[Block Communications]] controls a quadropoly of stations owned by itself ([[WLIO]], a full-powered NBC affiliate which also carries Fox and MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel) and low-power stations owned by West Central Ohio Broadcasting, Inc. (which owns ABC affiliate [[WPNM-LP]]/[[WOHL-CD]], and CBS affiliate [[WAMS-LP]]) under an LMA. One of the latter company's heads, Allan J.

A company may also exceed these limits if it owns stations broadcasting in both English and French; for instance, in the [[Montreal]] media market, [[Bell Media Radio]] owns six radio stations, of which two operate in French and four in English.\n\n===Television===\nOfficially, CRTC policy mandates that a broadcaster may only own one television station in a particular language in any given market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2000-221 (para. 11)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-221.HTM|work=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|year=2000}}</ref> However, there are two types of exemptions which may be granted:\n# small markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to limited advertising revenue;\n# large markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to audience fragmentation or the cost of programming rights.\n\nThe policy does not prevent companies from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of \"exemption\". [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]/[[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9|Radio-Canada]] [[owned-and-operated station]]s (O&Os) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a \"commercial\" general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter airs advertising, as with [[CTV Two Alberta|Access]] in Alberta.<ref name=\"ctvchum\">{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165 (para. 29)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/eng/Decisions/2007/db2007-165.htm|work=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|year=2000|access-date=2013-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906100523/http://crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/2007/db2007-165.htm|archive-date=2008-09-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the small and large market exemptions have a financial criterion in common, there are notable differences between the two. A small market twinstick may involve major network affiliates licensed to the same community, and is not obligated to provide distinct local news programming on the two stations, while in a large market the stations must be licensed to serve different communities or different programming niches, and ''cannot'' merge their news programming into a single operation. Small market twinsticks commonly share their branding across both stations, while twinsticks in large markets generally do not. As well, while small market twinsticks generally involve private [[network affiliate|affiliate]]s, major market twinsticks are virtually always owned-and-operated stations of their associated networks or [[television system|systems]].\n\nIn a few isolated cases, the CRTC has permitted \"triple-sticks\", or [[triopoly (disambiguation)|triopolies]], where a single broadcaster operates ''three'' stations in a market. These are only possible under unusual circumstances which are discussed as they arise below.\n\n====History====\nTwinsticks were first allowed in 1967, as a way to help expand [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] service to smaller markets. In the original twinstick model, the second station was a rebroadcaster of a CTV station in a larger market, to which the small market's existing [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate would be granted the advertising sales rights.\n\nAs the company's advertising revenue grew, the CTV transmitter would eventually become an originating station in its own right, and in theory would eventually be sold to another broadcaster. However, in many cases the subsequent sale never happened, as the community's economic growth failed to lend itself to competition between multiple television broadcasters. In other markets where the CRTC had licensed competing broadcasters, such as [[Northern Ontario]], twinstick mergers were subsequently allowed to permit the survival of both television stations after similar economic difficulties were encountered.\n\nWith the cross-national [[concentration of media ownership|consolidation]] of media ownership, nearly all of the original twinstick stations no longer share ownership with their former twin stations. However, the second type of twinstick, involving media consolidation in larger markets, began to arise in the 1990s.\n\n====Small markets====\nUp until February 2010, twinsticks of this type outside of [[Quebec]] involved CTV and CBC Television affiliates. Currently both small-market twinsticks in English Canada consist of [[Global Television Network|Global]] and CTV affiliates.\n* [[Lloydminster]] \u2013 [[CITL-TV|CITL]] and [[CKSA-TV|CKSA]] ([[Newcap Broadcasting]])\n* [[Thunder Bay]] \u2013 [[CHFD-TV|CHFD]] and [[CKPR-TV|CKPR]] ([[Dougall Media]])\n\nWithin Quebec, twinsticks may consist of any combination of Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] and [[V (TV network)|V]] affiliates:\n* [[Gatineau]] \u2013 [[CHOT-DT|CHOT]] and [[CFGS-DT|CFGS]] ([[RNC Media]])\n* [[Rouyn-Noranda]] \u2013 [[CKRN-DT|CKRN]] and [[CFEM-DT|CFEM]] (RNC Media)\n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, CTV directly owned several CBC twinstick stations that it had inherited from [[Baton Broadcasting]] ([[CKNC-TV|CKNC]], [[CHNB-TV|CHNB]], [[CJIC-TV|CJIC]] and [[CFCL-TV|CFCL]] in Northern Ontario, which were part of the [[CTV Northern Ontario|MCTV]] system, and [[CKBI-TV|CKBI]] and [[CKOS-TV|CKOS]] in [[Saskatchewan]]); these were sold to the CBC in 2002.\n\nOne \"triple-stick\" also exists, in which a single company, [[T\u00e9l\u00e9 Inter-Rives]], operates all three licensed stations in [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]]: [[CKRT-TV|CKRT]], [[CIMT-TV|CIMT]] and [[CFTF-TV|CFTF]]. An unofficial triple-stick also exists in the Rouyn-Noranda area, as RNC Media, the licensed owner of that city's twinstick, also operates [[CFVS-DT|CFVS]], the sole station licensed to the nearby city of [[Val-d'Or]]; in actual practice, all three stations serve both cities. These unusual situations arise because of the unique circumstances of francophone television stations in Quebec: with virtually no sources for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]], the stations are effectively constrained to network programming at all times, and both TVA and Radio-Canada maintain direct editorial control of local newscasts on all of their affiliates{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!-- this may have been true of certain SRC affils in the past - e.g. those owned by TQS (for conflict-of-interest reasons) - but I don't think it was ever a requirement for all SRC or TVA affils --> \u2013 meaning that despite being owned by a single company, the stations are still able to meet the guiding principles behind the CRTC's policies on media ownership.\n\nAs noted above, historically, twinstick operations were locally owned. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership in Canada, however, most twinstick operations are now owned by major media conglomerates. The [[Thunder Bay Television]] stations (CHFD/CKPR) are the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada. The aforementioned T\u00e9l\u00e9 Inter-Rives is similarly unique in Quebec, although it is itself ''partially'' owned by [[Quebecor]].\n\nUntil August 2008, [[Cogeco]] owned three twinsticks in Quebec: [[CKTV-TV|CKTV]] and [[CFRS-TV|CFRS]] in [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[CKSH-TV|CKSH]] and [[CFKS-TV|CFKS]] in [[Sherbrooke]] and [[CKTM-TV|CKTM]] and [[CFKM-TV|CFKM]] in [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]. These twinsticks were dissolved when Radio-Canada decided to acquire its former affiliates (CKTV, CKSH and CKTM), while the V affiliates (CFRS, CFKS and CFKM) were acquired by [[Remstar Corporation]], the new owner of V (then known as TQS).\n\n====Major markets====\nIn the mid-1990s, the CRTC also began to allow private companies operating in large markets to acquire smaller stations. In all such cases, the twinsticks are permitted because a diversity of broadcast voices already exists in the market,<ref>{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 2000-221 (para. 12)|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-221.HTM|work=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|year=2000}}</ref> and the stations are normally licensed to serve different communities in the metropolitan market or different programming niches. The stations must also be operated independently of each other, although they are permitted to cross-promote each other's programming. They may also air a very limited amount of common programming, although in practice this privilege is rarely used.\n\nCurrently, [[Bell Media]] operates twinsticks in three major markets, using the CTV and [[CTV Two]] brands:\n* [[Ottawa]] \u2013 [[CJOH-DT|CJOH]] and [[CHRO-DT|CHRO]]\n* [[Toronto]]-[[Barrie]] \u2013 [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] and [[CKVR-DT|CKVR]]\n* [[Vancouver]]-[[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] \u2013 [[CIVT-DT|CIVT]] and [[CIVI-DT|CIVI]]\n\nIn addition to these \"true\" twinsticks, in some areas, Bell Media has taken a twinstick-type approach with two stations deemed to be in ''adjacent'' media markets, but which in practice serve both markets. For example, Bell operates both CTV station [[CKCO-DT]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] and CTV Two station [[CFPL-DT]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], about {{convert|100|km|mi}} away. Both have been carried on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band of basic cable throughout much of [[southwestern Ontario]] for several decades. Hence, presumably as a result of this duplicated coverage, their current owner has elected to continue airing distinct programming on both stations (on the other hand, Kitchener is also about 100&nbsp;km from Toronto; nevertheless both CKCO and Toronto's CFTO operate as CTV stations).\n\nFinally, in some markets, Bell Media operates both a local over-the-air CTV station, and a provincial or regional cable channel that broadcasts CTV Two programming. In Alberta, CTV stations [[CFCN-DT|CFCN]] in [[Calgary]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN]] in [[Edmonton]] co-exist with [[CTV Two Alberta]], which is officially licensed as the provincial educational broadcaster and is therefore technically exempt from the CRTC's common ownership policy<ref name=\"ctvchum\"/> (prior to September 2011, CTV Two Alberta also operated over-the-air transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton). In the [[Maritime Provinces]], Bell Media operates both the over-the-air [[CTV Atlantic]] group of stations and the cable-only [[CTV Two Atlantic]], which have been jointly owned (under various parent companies) since the latter's launch in 1983.\n\n====Previous examples====\n[[Canwest]]<!-- Shaw is not applicable here; Canwest divested all of the \"secondary\" stations before Shaw ever got control of it. --> operated the [[CIII-DT|CIII]]/[[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] twinstick in Toronto-[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and the [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]]/[[CHEK-DT|CHEK]] twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria until 2009, under the [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[E! (Canadian TV system)|E!]] brands. These two sets of twinsticks were separated as a result of E!'s demise in August 2009, with Canwest retaining the Global O&Os (CIII and CHAN) and selling off the E! stations (CHCH and CHEK). Additionally, Canwest previously owned the now-defunct [[CHCA-TV|CHCA]] in [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], which was available on cable and via rebroadcast transmitters in both Calgary and Edmonton, where Canwest respectively already owned [[CICT-DT|CICT]] and [[CITV-DT|CITV]]. This was not considered a true twinstick as CHCA was not based in the larger markets, and did not have permission to solicit local advertising in those markets. It did, however, have [[simultaneous substitution]] rights.\n\n[[CHUM Television]] operated the [[CITY-DT|CITY]]/CKVR twinstick in Toronto-Barrie and the [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]]/CIVI twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria under the [[Citytv]] and [[CTV Two|A-Channel]] brands prior to its acquisition by [[CTVglobemedia]] in 2006. Following this acquisition, [[Rogers Media]] briefly held twinsticks in Vancouver (CKVU and [[CHNU-DT|CHNU]]) and Winnipeg ([[CHMI-DT|CHMI]] and [[CIIT-DT|CIIT]]), formed from its newly acquired Citytv stations and its [[Omni Television|Omni]]-branded religious stations; these two sets of twinsticks were dissolved in 2008 following the sales of CHNU and CIIT to [[S-VOX]].\n\nUnlike the situation in smaller markets, this type of \"[[concentration of media ownership|consolidation]]\" twinstick had been increasingly common up to the late 2000s, concurrently with the rise of secondary television systems (such as CH/E! and A-Channel) launched by their parent companies to complement their primary networks or systems (such as Global and Citytv). This trend was partially reversed in 2009 with the demise of E! and the subsequent dissolution of the Global/E! twinsticks.\n\n====Multiple languages====\nIn many major markets, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] operates both [[CBC Television]] (English) and [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]] (French) stations, as listed below. Prior to the CBC decommissioning all of its television rebroadcasters in 2012, both networks were available over-the-air in numerous other markets not listed below, but one or both of the transmitters was a rebroadcaster of a station originating in a different city; these were not usually considered true twinsticks. Nevertheless, both networks continue to be available as part of the basic programming tier on all cable and satellite providers nationwide.\n* [[Edmonton]] \u2013 [[CBXT-DT|CBXT]] and [[CBXFT-DT|CBXFT]]\n* [[Montreal]] \u2013 [[CBMT-DT|CBMT]] and [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]]\n* Ottawa \u2013 [[CBOT-DT|CBOT]] and [[CBOFT-DT|CBOFT]]\n* [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] \u2013 [[CBKT-DT|CBKT]] and [[CBKFT]]\n* Toronto \u2013 [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] and [[CBLFT-DT|CBLFT]]\n* Vancouver \u2013 [[CBUT-DT|CBUT]] and [[CBUFT-DT|CBUFT]]\n* [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] \u2013 [[CBET-DT|CBET]] and [[CBEFT]]\n* [[Winnipeg]] \u2013 [[CBWT-DT|CBWT]] and [[CBWFT-DT|CBWFT]]\n\nIn Toronto, Edmonton and [[Calgary]], Rogers Media's acquisition of the Citytv system put those stations in twinsticks with the multilingual [[Omni Television]] stations. In Toronto, Omni Television has its own twinstick, giving the company a nominal \"triple-stick\" in that market. The two Omni stations in Toronto each serve different segments of the market's multicultural audience, and thus are ''also'' permitted under the language exemption.\n* [[Calgary]] \u2013 [[CKAL-DT|CKAL]] and [[CJCO-DT|CJCO]]\n* Edmonton \u2013 [[CKEM-DT|CKEM]] and [[CJEO-DT|CJEO]]\n* Toronto \u2013 [[CFMT-DT|CFMT]], [[CJMT-DT|CJMT]] and [[CITY-DT|CITY]]\n* Vancouver \u2013 [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] and [[CHNM-DT|CHNM]]\n\nIn Montreal, Canwest owned both Global station [[CKMI-DT|CKMI]] and multicultural station [[CJNT-DT|CJNT]] until August 2009, when the latter was sold to [[Channel Zero Inc.|Channel Zero]].\n\nCTV was formerly a part-owner of the francophone [[V (TV network)|V]] network (formerly TQS) in Quebec, meaning that V's owned-and-operated [[CFJP-DT|CFJP]] in Montreal was a partial twinstick with CTV's [[CFCF-DT|CFCF]] for most of the 2000s. CFCF was, in fact, the original ''owner'' of TQS, meaning that the stations were once a true twinstick under the language exemption, although the two stations went through very different sequences of ownership changes after 1995.\n\n==Triopolies and quadropolies==\n[[NBCUniversal]] formerly owned three full-power stations in [[Los Angeles]], NBC owned-and-operated station [[KNBC]], [[Telemundo]] O&O [[KVEA]] and [[Spanish language]] independent station [[KWHY-TV]], before selling KWHY to the [[Alex Meruelo|Meruelo Group]] in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=FCC decision on transfer of existing Telemundo O&O stations to NBC-Telemundo's TN Acquisition Corp|url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Orders/2002/fcc02113r.txt|work=Federal Communications Commission|year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBC Universal to Sell LA Station KWHY-TV to Meruelo|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nbc-universal-sell-la-station-76275|author=George Szalai|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 26, 2012|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref> The FCC allows common ownership of three full-power television stations if there are 18 stations that are licensed within the market; as such, Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] are the only two U.S. markets which can legally have a true full-power triopoly,<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC adopts media ownership rules|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/06/02/news/companies/fcc_rules/|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=June 2, 2003}}</ref> though Sinclair owns a legal triopoly in [[Salt Lake City]] with CBS affiliate [[KUTV]], independent station [[KJZZ-TV]], and MyNetworkTV station [[KMYU]].\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission otherwise only permits common ownership of three full-power television stations within one market if the tertiary station is licensed under a [[broadcast relay station#satellite station|satellite station]] waiver (the FCC constitutes a full-power station that is licensed as a satellite as the same entity as its parent station, and therefore does not count them toward market ownership caps). A unique instance exists in [[Austin, Texas]], involving the ''de facto'' triopoly of NBC affiliate [[KXAN-TV]], CW affiliate [[KNVA]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KBVO (TV)|KBVO]], the latter of which signed on in 1991 as a [[Llano, Texas|Llano]]-based satellite of KXAN to serve western portions of the market where reception of that station's UHF signal was impaired by the [[Texas Hill Country|hilly terrain]] within the area. Even though KBVO was converted into a separately programmed station in October 2009 (and therefore no longer acts as a KXAN repeater, even by way of a subchannel), the FCC granted Media General permission to acquire its license under an existing satellite waiver during that company's merger with [[LIN Media]] in 2014<ref>{{cite web|title=Consent to Transfer Control of Licenses by Shareholders of Media General, Inc. and Shareholders of LIN Media, LLC to Post-Merger Shareholders of Media General, Inc.|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-14-1810A1.docx|work=Federal Communications Commission|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> (without the waiver, Media General/LIN would have been forced to sell either KBVO or KNVA, which would not have been viable in any event, since there are not enough unique full-power station owners in the Austin market to permit a second legal duopoly with an owner of one of the market's three English language [[KTBC (TV)|major]] [[KVUE|network]] [[KEYE-TV|affiliates]] and neither would have likely had long-term financial survivability as a standalone station).\n\nIn addition, the FCC permits common ownership of three television stations if there are low-powered stations that are involved.\n\nIn 2013, through its acquisition of stations from [[Newport Television]], Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a full-power virtual quadropoly made up of two legal duopolies in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], consisting of NBC affiliate [[KARK-TV]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[KARZ-TV]] (which Nexstar already owned), and Fox affiliate [[KLRT-TV]] and CW affiliate [[KASN]] (another existing duopoly that was acquired by Mission). Through the resulting local marketing agreement with Nexstar, the operations of KLRT and KASN were consolidated into KARK/KARZ's facilities; 30 employees were laid off as part of the consolidation.<ref name=ab-klrtkarkmerge>{{cite news|title=Almost 30 Lose Jobs at KARK, KLRT as TV Owners Consolidate|url=http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/90480/at-least-25-lose-jobs-at-kark-klrt-as-tv-owners-consolidate|accessdate=January 29, 2013|newspaper=[[Arkansas Business Publishing Group|Arkansas Business]]|date=January 29, 2013}}</ref> A similar virtual quadropoly in the [[Mobile, Alabama]]-[[Pensacola, Florida]] market was formed through another acquisition from Newport, this time by Sinclair, consisting of Pensacola-based ABC affiliate [[WEAR-TV]] and MyNetworkTV affiliate [[WFGX]] (which were both already owned by Sinclair and licensed to the beach community of [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida|Fort Walton Beach]]), and Mobile-based NBC affiliate [[WPMI]] and Pensacola-licensed independent station [[WJTC]] (owned by Deerfield, and operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement). Unlike the quadropoly in Little Rock, Sinclair has not consolidated all four stations into one facility and each duopoly maintains their own studios in different parts of the market (WEAR/WFGX on the Florida side, WPMI/WJTC on the Alabama side). Similarly structured virtual triopolies (many of which are run by Nexstar and Sinclair) also exist in a few markets, in which either an existing owner-operator of a legal duopoly also manages a tertiary station owned by a separate if indirectly related licensee, or owns-operates one station and runs two others that are owned by different licensees.\n\nIn Canada, at least one community ([[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]], [[Quebec]]) has all three of its local [[French language]] stations \u2013 [[CKRT-DT]], [[CIMT-DT]] and [[CFTF-DT]] \u2013 under common ownership, however such levels of common ownership are for the most part strongly discouraged by the CRTC unless the stations serve remote communities or separately carry programming in different languages (such as Rogers Media's aforementioned triopoly in Toronto, consisting of the English-language CITY-DT and multicultural stations CFMT-DT and CJMT-DT).\n\nIn Mexico, media concentration is endemic and it is not uncommon for as many as four stations to be operated by one entity. [[Televisa]] owns four [[Mexico City]] stations ([[XEW-TV|XEW]], [[XHTV-TV|XHTV]], [[XHGC-TV|XHGC]] and [[XEQ-TV|XEQ]]) while [[Azteca (multimedia conglomerate)|Azteca]], Mexico's second-largest broadcaster, owns three ([[XHIMT-TV|XHIMT]], [[XHDF-TV|XHDF]] and [[XHTVM-TV|XHTVM]]). These stations, in turn, feed large numbers of full-power affiliates. The largest Mexican network is the Televisa-owned [[Canal de las Estrellas]], which feeds its programming to more than 100 stations nationwide.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trimulcast]]\n* [[Concentration of media ownership]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duopoly (Broadcasting)}}\n[[Category:Broadcast law]]\n[[Category:Concentration of media ownership]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:United States communications regulation]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLow-power TV stations:Added title to ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duopoly_(broadcasting)"}

In 1976 the [[Housing NSW|NSW Department of Housing]] acquired the land the bunker is built under and redeveloped the area into the townhouses that now cover most of the site. The area now comprises a number of separate complexes or \"Closes\" containing eight to eleven villas. Each Close is named appropriately after a type of aeroplane that flew from Bankstown during the Second World War.\n\n===No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters Unit===\nWith the fall of Rabaul and Singapore to the Japanese Army in January and February of 1942 and the bombing of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] on the 19th February 1942, the Australian government and many Australians became fearful that Japan would invade the Australian mainland.  As part of the Australian [[Government of New South Wales|Government]]'s response to this threat, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was greatly expanded and the RAAF for the first time was given the role of air defence of Australia's strategic areas.  Fighter Sector Headquarters were established in [[Sydney]], [[New Lambton, New South Wales|New Lambton]] (NSW), [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], Townsville, Darwin, [[Perth]] and in Port Moresby.  In addition Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters were formed at Darwin, Perth, Townsville and [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] (NSW).<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe main responsibilities of the Fighter Sector Headquarters were to:\n* receive aircraft sightings from radar posts (known as Radio Direction Finding Posts) , Navy ships, Volunteer Air Observer Corps lookout posts and other sources;\n* Determine whether aircraft were friendly or hostile and if hostile direct fighter squadrons and/or Navy ships and Army anti-aircraft artillery units to shoot down the aircraft;\n* issue air raid warnings to RAAF, Army and Navy headquarters and civil authorities such as the police and fire brigades;\n* operate search-light batteries.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nSydney Fighter Sector Headquarters, known as No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters (1FSHQ), was established on 25 February 1942 and was responsible for the aerial defence of New South Wales. A temporary operations and plotting room were set up at the Capitol Picture Theatre in [[Bankstown]] (now the site of Bankstown Town Hall).  Less than two months later, on the 16 April, 1FSHQ handed over its responsibilities to the US Army Air Corps and the unit was disbanded.  In the next few months the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) relocated air defence operations to a disused railway tunnel near St. James Railway Station in the city.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nOn 3 August 1942 1FSHQ was reformed under the command of the RAAF Headquarters Eastern Area and the 1FSHQ once again took over responsibility for the air defence of New South Wales.  The operations room was moved back to the [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] in Bankstown on 7 September 1942. At this time the 1FSHQ comprised 19 officers and 164 other ranks, including 119 members of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).  The senior RAAF officers were largely drawn from aircrew, with junior RAAF officers being intelligence or administrative officers. Two of the unit officers were WAAAF officers and there were also Army and Navy officers in the unit for liaison duties. The enlisted personnel included:<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nOperators of telephones, teleprinters, radio telegraphy and telephony equipment who received the reports on aircraft movements from: radar stations, members of the Volunteer Air Observers Corps (Australia), ships, No. 2 and No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters, and by other means;\n* Clerks who plotted the location of aircraft and shipping on large maps;\n* Technicians who maintained the communications equipment; and\n* Support staff such as administrative clerks, cooks and drivers.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nBetween October 1943 and January 1945 the 1FSHQ underwent several name changes. On the 18 October 1943 it was renamed the No. 101 Fighter Sector and then on 7 March 1944 the name was changed to No. 101 Fighter Control Unit.  On 21 January 1945 the unit was renamed Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ Sydney) and air defence operations were moved into a purpose built operations room located at Condell Park. By this time many of the RAAF members of the unit had been posted to northern Australia or New Guinea and members of the No. 2 Volunteer Air Observers Corps (VAOC) had taken their places.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Air Defence Headquarters Sydney===\nDocumentary evidence indicates that the search for a permanent site to construct a purpose built combined Fighter Sector Headquarters and Gun Operation Room was underway by August 1942.  Eventually the site of a shallow quarry on Black Charlie's Hill was selected. The site had extensive views to the east, west and to the south and on a clear day, reportedly the arch of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] could be seen. The land, which was owned by the Bankstown Hospital Trust, was resumed under National Security Regulations. The Commonwealth Government later acquired the site in circa August 1945.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nApproval for the construction of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was given by the Minister of Air, as an urgent war measure, on 7 November 1942.  Work on the two-storey underground bunker was scheduled to begin in January 1943 and surviving documentation indicates that by April the foundations of the structure were well under way. Construction of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was completed by August 1944, with the exception of the installation of the telephone and signals cables, which were to be installed by the Post Master General's Office in November of that year.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe main contractor of the project was Stuart Bros Pty Ltd of Sydney. Bankstown Municipal Council carried out the electrical reticulation of the building and the air conditioning equipment appears to have been supplied and installed by Carrier Air Conditioning Limited of Spring Street, Sydney. The estimated cost to construct the bunker and the above ground, support buildings which included: an Administration Building, Rest Rooms and Kitchen, Male and Female Latrines, and Garage, was A\u00a320,400. The final cost of the project was A\u00a336,255.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nWhen completed the building comprised a ground floor and basement, at the heart of which was a two-storey high Operations Room. The Operations Room was dominated by a large plotting table, on which the WAAAF personnel plotted aircraft movements. Other key operational areas of the bunker included: a Gun Operations Room (anti-aircraft guns), the Search-light Operations Room and the Naval Plotting Room.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe new covert Air Defence Headquarters became operational in January 1945. The unit history report for this period indicates that 49 officers and 128 other ranks of the RAAF and WAAAF staffed the ADHQ along with personnel from the Army, Navy and Volunteer Air Corp.  However as the ADHQ operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week not all of the assigned personnel were on duty at one time. For security reasons the personnel were transported to and from the ADHQ by bus. Accommodation for ADHQ personnel was located in the Bankstown Shopping area.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nWith the end of WWII in the Pacific in September 1945, the VAOC ceased full-time operations and the RAAF and WAAAF staff were demobilised. In January 1947 the ADHQ unit was disbanded and the bunker closed.  The building remained unoccupied until {{circa|1965}}, when it was briefly reoccupied by the Navy for naval manoeuvres in the Pacific. Following the conclusion of those manoeuvres the building was once again closed up. The bunker lay largely undisturbed until April 1971 when Phil Engisch, editor of the ''Bankstown - Canterbury Torch'' newspaper, accompanied by Aldman Leslie Gillman and others, toured the facility.  Following the tour, the location of the ADHQ was made public in an article published in the ''Torch'' newspaper.  The article, entitled \"The Torch uncovers secret RAAF war base\" was also simultaneously published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nIn the article Engisch recorded how the tour party wandered through a maze of corridors and intact rooms, likening the experience to \"...something one might expect to see in a Sean Connery 007 movie.\" Unfortunately, approximately four months after the location of the bunker was made public, the interior of the building was destroyed by fire. The fire is thought to have been started by either homeless people taking shelter in the bunker, or vandals. The blaze began on the evening of 9 August and is said to have burned for more than a week.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nIn the early 1970s the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] handed over the {{convert|9|acre|ha|0|order=flip|adj=on}} site to the [[Department of Housing and Construction (1973\u201375)|Commonwealth Department of Housing]]. In 1976 a [[Defence Housing Authority]] medium density housing scheme, designed by architectural firm Robertson and Hindmarsh Pty Ltd, was constructed on the former ADHQ site. The housing estate was designed to ensure that the underground bunker was located in one of the open spaces of the estate. It was at this time that the above ground, support buildings for the bunker were demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe exact location of the main entry and exit passages into the bunker are not known, as the area over the top and sides of the building has been landscaped concealing the bunker's existence.  However, in the 1980s and 1990s the bunker was entered at  least three occasions. On one such occasion, a film crew from the popular television show ''[[Burke's Backyard]]'', crawled through an air vent into the facility and the television show's host, [[Don Burke]], hosted an episode of the show  from the bunker. Footage from the television show and photographs taken by other individuals who have gained entry to the building indicate that the facility is structurally intact.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Associated buildings===\nAir Board documentation indicates that the Fighter Sector VHF/RT system (Very High Frequency Radio Transmission System) was to comprise: 3 VHF/DF (Direction Finder) fixer stations, 1 VHF/DF homing station, 1 remote (local) transmitting station, 1 remote (local) receiving station and 2 relay stations (each consisting of a receiver and transmitter). In the case of the Sydney ADHQ relay stations were considered unnecessary by Defence authorities as it was anticipated that the height of the sites selected for the new VHF transmitter and receiver stations would ensure satisfactory communications. As it turned out, the new transmitting and receiver stations were never built and the Sydney ADHQ relied on the existing receiving station at [[Picnic Point, New South Wales|Picnic Point]], [[Revesby, New South Wales|Revesby]] and the existing transmitting station at Johnston Street, [[Bass Hill, New South Wales|Bass Hill]].  According to surviving documents radar stations at Robertson, [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth]] and [[Somersby, New South Wales|Somersby]] were to acted as VHF/DF Fixer stations for the ADHQ.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nOther radar stations known to have passed on information (usually by telephone) to 1FSHQ and therefore probably to the ADHQ, were No. 17 Radar Station located at [[Moruya, New South Wales|Moruya]], No. 18 Radar Station located at [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]], No. 19 Radar Station located at Bombi near [[Gosford]] and No. 101 Radar Station located on [[Sydney Heads|North Head]], Sydney. Information would also have been passed on from No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters at [[Lambton, New South Wales|Lambton]] and No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters at [[Brisbane]].<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Other Fighter Sector Headquarters===\nNo 2. Fighter Sector Headquarters formed at New Lambton NSW on 25 February 1942. The unit commandeered the New Lambton Public School for its operations before moving to Ash Island on the 3 December 1944. No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters was to be responsible for fighter aircraft control and coordination for the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and Hunter region. However it appears that 2FSHQ was non-operational and functioned as a training facility while, located at New Lambton.  There is no indication that a purpose built headquarters (similar to that built in Condell Park) was constructed for this unit.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters was formed at Townsville on 25 February 1942. The unit controlled fighter operations and anti-aircraft defences through North [[Queensland]] and New Guinea. The unit operated from a grammar school at North Ward until a semi underground bunker (identified as such because all the cabling was laid underground), was constructed between 1942 and 1943. The new fighter sector headquarters was built on the lower slopes of [[Mount Stuart, New South Wales|Mount Stuart]] and became fully operational on 20 December 1944. In 1962 or 1963 the interior of the bunker was destroyed by fire.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was formed at Darwin on 25 February, six days after the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces. The unit was responsible for all air operations over northern Australia, from Broome to Cape York. Initially the Fighter Sector Headquarters operated out of tents and then a rough shed at Sandfly Gully, a kilometre south of the Darwin airstrip. At a later date an Operations Room was constructed at Berrimah, 15km east of Darwin. Information provided by men who worked at the site indicates that the building was a semi underground  structure, that initially comprising one room but which was later expanded to two rooms. In the years following the close of WWII the exact location of the Berrimah Operations Room was lost, however, in 1995 a search for the building was initiated and by 1997 intact concrete floors of two adjacent rooms (tentatively identified as those of the Filter Room and Operations Room) had been identified on Berrimah Farm.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 6 Fighter Sector Headquarters was former in Perth on 22 April 1942. An Operations Room was setup in the Alma Street Masonic Hall at Mt. Lawley.  Between January and March 1945 the unit moved into a new underground bunker in Epsom Avenue in [[Belmont, New South Wales|Belmont]], Perth.  The [[Heritage Council of Western Australia]]'s data inventory sheet for the Belmont Bunker, describes the bunker as having moderate to high integrity, with a few alterations taking place to convert the former Fighter Sector Headquarters to a potential operations headquarters for the Civil Defence and Emergency Department (also known as the [[New South Wales State Emergency Service|State Emergency Service]]).<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo 7 Fighter Sector Headquarters, like the other Fighter Sector Headquarters, was formed in haste (on 4 May 1942) and the Operations Room was setup in the [[Preston, Queensland|Preston]] Town Hall, Melbourne.  No. 7 Fighter Sector Headquarters appears to have remained at the Preston Town Hall until February 1946 when it was moved to the RAAF base, Point Cook.  There does not appear to have been a purpose built headquarters (similar to the Condell Park facility) constructed for this unit.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters was originally operated by the US Eighth Fighter Group, USAAC. When the 8th Fighter Group was reassigned to Townsville the Fighter Sector Headquarters was briefly taken over by the by the 565th Aircraft Warning Battalion, US Army. The No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters RAAF was formed on 3 August 1942. The unit was located on the 3rd level of the Wills Building in Ann Street Brisbane. The building has since been demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1857/><ref name=NAA>{{cite web|author=|date=|title=No.1 Installation Bankstown|work=[[National Archives of Australia]] |quote=NAA:A705,171/26/31 Pt 1 & 2|url=http://www.naa.gov.au}}</ref><ref>Information supplied by Squadron Leader Dave Burns, Office of the Air Force History</ref><ref name=R&H>{{cite book|author=Robertson & Hindmarsh P/L Architects|date=2006|title=World Wars 1 & 2, Survey of Buildings, Sites and Cultural Landscapes in NSW|number=Bankstown Aerodrome 6B}}</ref><ref name=BankstownVerticle>{{cite book|author=|date=|title=Bankstown City Library Vertical File Local Studies - RAAF Underground Bunker}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rosen, Sue|title=Bankstown: A Sense of Identity|date=|location=|publisher=}}</ref><ref>History of Cinema of Bankstown City by Kevin Cork</ref><ref>Fighter Sector (Darwin): Control of Australia's Air War 1942-45 by Graham Calley</ref><ref name=bankstown>{{cite book|author=Bankstown City Council|date=25 August 2009|title=Item 5.5 Second (WW2) Bunker at Condell Park, Ordinary Meeting of Bankstown City Council }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RAAF Headquarters Bunker Belmont|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au|work=www.ozatwar.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite|title=Operations and Signals Bunker (former)|work=www.heritage.gov.au}}</ref><ref name=Burke>{{cite book|author=Burke, Don|author-link=Don Burke|title=Footage of [[Burke's Backyard]]|publisher=[[CTC (TV station)|CTC Productions]]|date=|location=Australia|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Former Air Defence Headquarters (ADHQ) occupied a nine-acre site, which was enclosed by a 6 foot high (1.83m) barbwire man proofed camouflaged fence. The eastern half of the site was dissected by a gravel road which ran across the site in a north-south direction. The main entrance to the site was the southern termination of this road. A second entry/exit point was located at the northern end of the gravel road.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe largest structure on the site was a two storey underground bunker from where the air defence of New South Wales was controlled. In addition to the bunker, a 1942 site plan indicates that there were to be five above ground, support structures on the site.  The buildings comprised: an Administration Hut, Rest Room and Kitchen Hut, a Female Latrine, a Male Latrine, and a Motor Transport Garage. The support buildings were located close to the southern boundary of this site, just west of the gravel road.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nToday, the Former Air Defence Headquarters lies under one of the open spaces of a housing estate built on the site in the 1970s. The area over the top and sides of the building has been landscaped concealing the building's existence. The exact location of the main entry and exit passages into the bunker are not known. Images of the interior of the bunker taken in the 1980s and 1990s, indicate that despite the fire that gutted the interior the building is structurally intact.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Detailed description===\nThe following description of the Air Defence Headquarters and above ground, support buildings has been taken largely from a site plan dated 4th November 1942, floor layout and section drawings dated 3rd March 1943, A plan of alterations and additions to the ADHQ (specifically the Gun Room, Army Switch and Test Room) dated 27h August 1943 and the building specification dated circa November 1942.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Support buildings===\nFour of the above ground, support buildings are shown on the 1942 site plan as being grouped around a [[driveway]], which branched off the main gravel road in a westerly direction, near the southern boundary of the site. The fifth building (the Female Latrine) was short distance to the north of the main group.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nAccording to the 1942 site plan, the first buildings encountered along the driveway were the Administration Building on the south side of the driveway with the Rest Room and Kitchen Building directly opposite. Each of the buildings comprised two \"c series\" military huts. The Administration Building (C15 military huts) included office space, a General Masters store and an orderly room.  A kitchen, canteen and store were at the centre of the Rest Room and Kitchen Building (C7 military huts). The Equipment Officer's Room and the officers buffet and rest room were located on one side of the kitchen-canteen complex with the other ranks buffet and rest room  located on the other.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe next building encountered along the driveway was the Male Latrine, which was located on the north side of the driveway and comprised a single \"c series\" (c.12) military hut. The latrine was divided into two areas with the officer's latrine located in the eastern end and facilities for the other ranks located in the western end of the building.  Between the Rest Room and Kitchen Building and the Male Latrine, and to the north of these buildings was the Female Latrine, which also comprised a single 'c series (c.12) military hut.  Unlike the Male Latrine there was no division between officers and other ranks, in facilities provided.  At end of the drive was the garage comprising four posts and [[skillion roof]].<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Air Defence Headquarters===\nThe Former Air Defence Headquarters is a semi-underground bunker that became fully underground after construction.  The building was constructed using a \"cut and fill\" method. The soil excavated from digging the basement level into the natural ground, was used to cover the second-storey which was constructed above ground.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe underground bunker comprised two levels, a ground floor and basement both 9' (2.75m) in height. The exterior walls of the structure were constructed of brick approximately 2' (61cm) in thickness, and were protected with earth filling. The Interior partition walls were mostly constructed of brick and timber and clad with caneite. A visitor to the bunker in the 1970s stated that the interior was painted \"in army colours.\" The ceiling and floors comprised reinforced concrete 4\" (10.2cm) thick. The flat, overhanging concrete roof of the bunker, was at least 18\" (45.7cm) thick and was designed survive a direct hit from a 500 1b bomb. A  3/4\" (1.9cm) thick layer of asphalt was laid over the flat concrete roof as a damp course. The asphalt was then covered by at least 2' 3\" (68.6cm) of earth fill.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe entrance to the bunker appears to have been located approximately midway long the eastern [[facade]] of the bunker and was accessed via concrete passage strategically placed behind an earth embankment. An assessment of the fire protection measures required for the 1FSHQ (both temporary HQ and new building) undertaken in December 1943, noted that there were \"emergency escapes\" at the south and north ends of the building. An exit from the south end of the building from ground floor level, is shown on floor plans of bunker dated March 1943.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Ground floor layout===\nThe floor plan indicates that the ground floor of the bunker is essentially rectangular in shape, with a small rectangular shaped extension attached to the south-west corner of the bunker.  The ground floor measures approximately 97' and 1 1/4\" along its western side (excluding the extension), 54' along its northern end, 97' and 1 1/4\" along its the eastern side and 35' and 4 1/2\" along its southern side (excluding the extension). Equating to an approximate size of 29.60 x 16.46 x 29.60 x 10.78 metres. The rectangular shaped extension measures 20' and 7 1/2\" by 18' and 7 1/2\" (approximately 6.27 x 5.68 metres)<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nAs stated above, entrance to the bunker was gained through the eastern facade of the building. After passing through the concrete passageway a visitor to the bunker would emerge in a light lock, access to the bunker was through a door in the wall immediately in front of them.  Stepping through the door, a visitor would find him or herself confronting a guard, who was no doubt tasked with vetting the identity of anyone who gained access to the bunker. To the left of the entry door stretched an almost 8 metres long corridor which led to the Army Buffet, with access to AWAS Latrine, located at its southern end.  Immediately in front of the entry door (across the passage) was an antechamber. A door in the north wall of the chamber led to the optical angulator.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nAccording the floor plan, if a visitor turned right upon entering the bunker, and followed the corridor as it ran north along the eastern perimeter of the building they would find the Signals Room, which was located in the north-east corner of the bunker. The Signals Room was where incoming communications form the telephone, teleprinters and radar would be sorted before being distributed to the relevant people in the ADHQ.  Turning left at the Signals Room provided access to a corridor that ran almost the length of the northern end of the ground floor.  The first door encountered on the north side of the corridor was the door to the Signals Room, followed by door openings to the Cypher and Intelligence Room (where messages where encoded and decoded when security was required), the P.B.X Switch (private business telephone exchange), RAAF buffet, WAAAF Latrine, RAAF Male Latrine. At the end of the corridor (in the north-west corner of the bunker) was the Post Master General's (PMG)  Frame Room. The PMG was responsible for supplying the telegraphy and telephony cabling to the ADHQ.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe two-storey high Operations Room formed the centrepiece of the bunker.  The floor plan indicate that the Operations Room would have been dominated by a large plotting table on which would have been painted a map with appropriate map references. Plotter (members of the WAAAF) would used plotting table to plot aircraft movements, passed through from the Filter Room.   At the eastern end of the upper part of the Operations Room (ground floor level), was the Controllers Gallery. The Controller was generally a pilot of senior rank who was equipped with telephones and a radio. The radio allowed him to speak directly to fighter aircraft sent to interpret hostile aircraft. A series of four R/T (Radio Telephony) Cabinet Rooms were accessible from the eastern end of the Controllers Gallery.  Projecting out over the western end, of the upper part of the Operations Room, was a small platform, that gave access to indicator boards presumably associated with the Teleprinter and Traffic Room, located immediately behind the platform.  The room immediately adjacent to the south wall of the Teleprinter and Traffic Room housed Emergency Wireless Telegraph/Telephony equipment.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe northern half of the bunker was dominated by the upper part of the two-storey high Volunteer Air Observers Corp (V.A.O.C) and R/D/F (Radar Directional Finder) Filter Rooms.  The Filter Room was where reports of aircraft sighting were \"filtered\" to establish their height and bearing. The Movements Gallery, where all allied aircraft movements in the operational area were recorded, was sandwiched between the upper part of the V.A.O.C R/D/F rooms and the upper part of the Operation Room. The Guns Room (anti-aircraft guns) and the Search-Light Operations Room dominated the southern half of the ground floor of the bunker. Adjacent to the southern wall of the Guns Room was a Army Switch Room (south-west corner of the main section of the bunker) and a Test Room.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nExiting through a door opening in the east wall of the Test Room provided access to a corridor that ran in an east-west direction.  Lining the south side of the corridor were three height converter booths. An additional height converter booth was located on the north side of the corridor. Immediately north of this room was the Search-Light Operations Room. At the eastern end of corridor on north side was the Male Army Latrine.  Immediately north of Latrine was the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) Latrine and Army Buffet mentioned earlier.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nA door opening in the south wall of the Army Switch Room (referred to above) provided access to one of two Air Conditioning Rooms, which occupied the northern end of the small rectangular extension, that projects off the south-western corner of the ground floor of the bunker. To the south of the Air Conditioning Rooms was located the power unit for the bunker and an emergency power generator.  Access to the \"emergency escape\" exit located at the southern end of the bunker, appears to have been though an opening in the south wall of the area housing the emergency power generator.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Basement===\nAccording to the floor plan, the basement measures approximately {{convert|39|ft|3.5|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along its northern end, {{convert|72|ft|5.75|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along its western side, {{convert|69|ft|1|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along the length of the eastern elevation and {{convert|46|ft|5|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along its southern end. The centre of the east elevation of the basement is indented, giving the basement level the appearance of a capitalised letter \"E\" when viewed in plan. The Operations Room dominates the centre of the basement. At the eastern end of the Operations Room was the Intercept Officer's dais. The Intercept Officer was responsible for plotting the best course in intercept enemy aircraft. The V.A.O.C and R/D/F Filter Rooms dominate the northern half of the basement. On the south side of the Operations Room is the Naval Plot Room. The basement floor plan indicates that this room contained a long narrow plot table which occupied almost the entire length of the room.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nInformation provided in the newspaper article written by Phil Engisch, indicates that there may have been was some adjustment to the floor plan of the ADHQ, after the March 1943 plan was produced. Engisch noted in his article that the bunker had toilet and shower facilities (whereas the plans appear to show latrines only). Engisch also recorded the presence of a small number of bedrooms, which are not shown on the 1943 floor plans of the building. It is also possible that these modifications date from the 1960s when the ADHQ was used for naval manoeuvres in the Pacific.<ref name=nswshr-1857/><ref name=NAA/><ref name=bankstown/><ref name=R&H/><ref>Fighter sector (Darwin): Control of Australia's Air War 1942-1945</ref><ref name=Torch>{{cite book|last=Engisch|first=Phil|date=21 April 1971|title=The Torch uncovers secret RAAF war base |work=Cantebury-Bankstown Torch}}</ref><ref name=BankstownVerticle/><ref name=Burke/>\n\n===Condition===\nAs at 13 September 2010, a few months after the existence of the bunker was made public, in April 1971, the interior of the bunker was gutted by fire. The bunker has been accessed on several occasions since the fire.  Peter Treseder, in an article published in the January-March 1994 issue of ''[[Australian Geographic]]'', claimed that in 1987 he entered the bunker. Treseder described the bunker as being \"...a blackened shell with lots of rooms and passages running off at various levels.\"  A group known as the Bunker Boyz entered the bunker in {{circa|1996}}.

Entrance to the bunker was obtained via a concrete passageway concealed beneath a grassy slope with corridors and hallways leading to various sections.<ref>(information supplied by R.

It had all the attenuated fixtures necessary to run a top secret operational defence base. It consisted of three Fixer Stations and one [[Homing beacon|Homing Station]]. There were switchboards directing up to fifty telephone lines that went to various locations including radar stations and VAOC lookout posts which reported aircraft locations to the bunker. The bunker was also equipped with its own code room, plotting rooms, two escape tunnels and a radio transmitter room. In the centre of the bunker was a large room of about two stories in height. This was the main Ops room and control centre for all RAAF Missions in the Pacific area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/SUB/SUB-09.htm |title=Subterranean Sydney |publisher=Sydney Architecture |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> The room also had a large map, (24' x 18') denoting troop positions in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II]].\n\nThe facilities inside the bunker also had to cater for the full-time staff who lived and worked in the facility, working on a rotating roster that involved living in the bunker for two-week periods. The living quarters consisted of its own kitchen, dining area, bathrooms and bedrooms. The bunker also had its own generator and air conditioning.<ref name=jlbmlm>{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Joan |author2=Madden, Brian|author3=Muir, Lesley|title=Pictorial History of Canterbury Bankstown|date=September 1999|publisher=Kingsclear Books|url=http://www.kingsclearbooks.com.au/cb.html|isbn=0-908272-55-3 }}</ref>{{rp|89}}\n\nThere are rumours of a tunnel running from the bunker to an unknown location.<ref>{{cite news|first= Merle|last=Peters|authorlink=|title=Historian's account|url=|work=|publisher=Bankstown Torch Newspaper|date=20 January 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Modifications and dates===\nA fire that started on 9 August 1971 destroyed the interior of the bunker. The air vents, electricity and wireless telegraphy/telephony poles mounted on the roof of the bunker were removed in association with the 1976 redevelopment of the site by the Commonwealth Department of Housing.  The above ground, support buildings were also demolished as part of the redevelopment of the site in the 1970s.<ref name=nswshr-1857/><ref name=R&H/>\n\n==Location==\nThere is a small reserve between the town houses at the end of Taylor Street. It is under this hill that the bunker has been buried. The entrance to the bunker has now been sealed and the area over the top of the bunker has been landscaped to conceal its position, to the point where it is completely undetectable from the street.\n\n===Other bunkers in the City of Bankstown===\n[[Image:Bankstown01.jpg|thumb|The remote receiving station. Map date 17 February 1942.]]\n[[Image:Chullora railway workshop, New South Wales.JPG|thumb|Chullora Railway Workshops and former site of WWII manufacturing plant.]]\nThere is one other confirmed bunker, a \"Remote Receiving station\", in Bankstown.<ref>[http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/bunkers/bankstownremotereceivingbuilding.htm Bankstown Remote Receiving Building, Bankstown, New South Wales, during WW2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Little is known about its history though it was reportedly \"heavily vandalised\" in 1945. It was located in [[Picnic Point, New South Wales|Picnic Point]] National Park, near the South Sydney Power station.<ref>see map \u2013 [[:Image:Bankstown01.jpg]]</ref> According to residents of the area, it still exists. Based on a comparison of contemporary and historic maps, the Receiving Station and the present day Sydney South electricity substation share the same footprint, with the latter apparently situated directly above the former. The substation is bounded on its southwestern and southeastern sides by Henry Lawson Drive, in the [[Georges River National Park]]. It is alleged that there are several other bunkers in the Bankstown area, such as under an electricity block house on the corner of Milperra Road and Henry Lawson Drive, and a demolished bunker under Condell Park High School.\n\nDuring World War II, Bankstown was a hive for military activity. Bankstown Airport was home to several fighter units and several \"dummy houses\" existed in and around Bankstown Airport. These houses were built to make Bankstown Airport and its surrounds appear as a farm. Military personnel who worked in Bankstown lived in the area around Chapel Road (where Paul Keating Park and the council chambers are located today).  Training facilities for the various plotting rooms around Sydney were also located in the area.\n\nDuring World War II a major wartime manufacturing plant was located in [[Chullora, New South Wales|Chullora]]. The site once occupied {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of land surrounded by [[Rookwood Cemetery]], Brunker Road, the [[Hume Highway]] and Centenary Drive. The site was said to have been the largest secret manufacturing plant in Australia which was used for the production of military weapons, plane components, tanks, and ordnance. Over two-thousand men and woman were employed to work at the factory on a daily basis. During the war the factory produced components for 700 Beaufort, 380 Beaufighter and up to 50 Lincoln aircraft. Over 54 ACI tanks were built as well as 60 General Lee tanks that were adapted for use in the Australian Military, as were local jeeps in the 70s. The factory also produced 81 cupola [[Gun turret|turrets]] for the British Matilda tanks.<ref name=jlbmlm />{{rp|91\u201392}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ozatwar.com/bunkers/chullorabunker.htm | title= Chullora \"Bunker\" and underground Tunnels.

The entrance to the \"bunker\" is by steel doors set in concrete into the hillside in a railway cutting which runs from alongside the railway line parallel to Marlene Crescent at a platform called the Railwelders and which leads under the block of flats. The doors to this \"bunker\" were welded up in the late 1980s. The ventilation shafts that were once visible from the [[Hume Highway]] have been removed.\n\nApart from the bunker, there is also a network of storage facilities that extend under the railway workshop. Sometime between 1977 and 1978 the steel access doors were fitted with locks (Railway SL type). The steel access doors were bolted into the side of a stormwater drain which runs along the old [[Roads and Traffic Authority|RTA]] building in Chullora, then under the Hume Hwy and eventually under the rail workshop. It has also been alleged that a tunnel approximately four miles long connects this complex with the Bankstown Bunker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westernsydneybunkers.webs.com/chulloramunitionssite.htm |title=Chullora Munitions Site \u2013 Western Sydney Bunkers |publisher=Westernsydneybunkers.webs.com |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301103549/http://westernsydneybunkers.webs.com/chulloramunitionssite.htm |archive-date=1 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Representation in popular culture==\nThe Bankstown Bunker was featured on an episode of ''[[Burke's Backyard]]''.

In 1976 the [[Housing NSW|NSW Department of Housing]] acquired the land the bunker is built under and redeveloped the area into the townhouses that now cover most of the site. The area now comprises a number of separate complexes or \"Closes\" containing eight to eleven villas. Each Close is named appropriately after a type of aeroplane that flew from Bankstown during the Second World War.\n\n===No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters Unit===\nWith the fall of Rabaul and Singapore to the Japanese Army in January and February of 1942 and the bombing of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] on the 19th February 1942, the Australian government and many Australians became fearful that Japan would invade the Australian mainland.  As part of the Australian [[Government of New South Wales|Government]]'s response to this threat, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was greatly expanded and the RAAF for the first time was given the role of air defence of Australia's strategic areas.  Fighter Sector Headquarters were established in [[Sydney]], [[New Lambton, New South Wales|New Lambton]] (NSW), [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], Townsville, Darwin, [[Perth]] and in Port Moresby.  In addition Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters were formed at Darwin, Perth, Townsville and [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] (NSW).<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe main responsibilities of the Fighter Sector Headquarters were to:\n* receive aircraft sightings from radar posts (known as Radio Direction Finding Posts) , Navy ships, Volunteer Air Observer Corps lookout posts and other sources;\n* Determine whether aircraft were friendly or hostile and if hostile direct fighter squadrons and/or Navy ships and Army anti-aircraft artillery units to shoot down the aircraft;\n* issue air raid warnings to RAAF, Army and Navy headquarters and civil authorities such as the police and fire brigades;\n* operate search-light batteries.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nSydney Fighter Sector Headquarters, known as No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters (1FSHQ), was established on 25 February 1942 and was responsible for the aerial defence of New South Wales. A temporary operations and plotting room were set up at the Capitol Picture Theatre in [[Bankstown]] (now the site of Bankstown Town Hall).  Less than two months later, on the 16 April, 1FSHQ handed over its responsibilities to the US Army Air Corps and the unit was disbanded.  In the next few months the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) relocated air defence operations to a disused railway tunnel near St. James Railway Station in the city.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nOn 3 August 1942 1FSHQ was reformed under the command of the RAAF Headquarters Eastern Area and the 1FSHQ once again took over responsibility for the air defence of New South Wales.  The operations room was moved back to the [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] in Bankstown on 7 September 1942. At this time the 1FSHQ comprised 19 officers and 164 other ranks, including 119 members of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF).  The senior RAAF officers were largely drawn from aircrew, with junior RAAF officers being intelligence or administrative officers. Two of the unit officers were WAAAF officers and there were also Army and Navy officers in the unit for liaison duties. The enlisted personnel included:<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nOperators of telephones, teleprinters, radio telegraphy and telephony equipment who received the reports on aircraft movements from: radar stations, members of the Volunteer Air Observers Corps (Australia), ships, No. 2 and No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters, and by other means;\n* Clerks who plotted the location of aircraft and shipping on large maps;\n* Technicians who maintained the communications equipment; and\n* Support staff such as administrative clerks, cooks and drivers.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nBetween October 1943 and January 1945 the 1FSHQ underwent several name changes. On the 18 October 1943 it was renamed the No. 101 Fighter Sector and then on 7 March 1944 the name was changed to No. 101 Fighter Control Unit.  On 21 January 1945 the unit was renamed Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ Sydney) and air defence operations were moved into a purpose built operations room located at Condell Park. By this time many of the RAAF members of the unit had been posted to northern Australia or New Guinea and members of the No. 2 Volunteer Air Observers Corps (VAOC) had taken their places.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Air Defence Headquarters Sydney===\nDocumentary evidence indicates that the search for a permanent site to construct a purpose built combined Fighter Sector Headquarters and Gun Operation Room was underway by August 1942.  Eventually the site of a shallow quarry on Black Charlie's Hill was selected. The site had extensive views to the east, west and to the south and on a clear day, reportedly the arch of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] could be seen. The land, which was owned by the Bankstown Hospital Trust, was resumed under National Security Regulations. The Commonwealth Government later acquired the site in circa August 1945.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nApproval for the construction of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was given by the Minister of Air, as an urgent war measure, on 7 November 1942.  Work on the two-storey underground bunker was scheduled to begin in January 1943 and surviving documentation indicates that by April the foundations of the structure were well under way. Construction of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was completed by August 1944, with the exception of the installation of the telephone and signals cables, which were to be installed by the Post Master General's Office in November of that year.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe main contractor of the project was Stuart Bros Pty Ltd of Sydney. Bankstown Municipal Council carried out the electrical reticulation of the building and the air conditioning equipment appears to have been supplied and installed by Carrier Air Conditioning Limited of Spring Street, Sydney. The estimated cost to construct the bunker and the above ground, support buildings which included: an Administration Building, Rest Rooms and Kitchen, Male and Female Latrines, and Garage, was A\u00a320,400. The final cost of the project was A\u00a336,255.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nWhen completed the building comprised a ground floor and basement, at the heart of which was a two-storey high Operations Room. The Operations Room was dominated by a large plotting table, on which the WAAAF personnel plotted aircraft movements. Other key operational areas of the bunker included: a Gun Operations Room (anti-aircraft guns), the Search-light Operations Room and the Naval Plotting Room.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe new covert Air Defence Headquarters became operational in January 1945. The unit history report for this period indicates that 49 officers and 128 other ranks of the RAAF and WAAAF staffed the ADHQ along with personnel from the Army, Navy and Volunteer Air Corp.  However as the ADHQ operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week not all of the assigned personnel were on duty at one time. For security reasons the personnel were transported to and from the ADHQ by bus. Accommodation for ADHQ personnel was located in the Bankstown Shopping area.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nWith the end of WWII in the Pacific in September 1945, the VAOC ceased full-time operations and the RAAF and WAAAF staff were demobilised. In January 1947 the ADHQ unit was disbanded and the bunker closed.  The building remained unoccupied until {{circa|1965}}, when it was briefly reoccupied by the Navy for naval manoeuvres in the Pacific. Following the conclusion of those manoeuvres the building was once again closed up. The bunker lay largely undisturbed until April 1971 when Phil Engisch, editor of the ''Bankstown - Canterbury Torch'' newspaper, accompanied by Aldman Leslie Gillman and others, toured the facility.  Following the tour, the location of the ADHQ was made public in an article published in the ''Torch'' newspaper.  The article, entitled \"The Torch uncovers secret RAAF war base\" was also simultaneously published in ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nIn the article Engisch recorded how the tour party wandered through a maze of corridors and intact rooms, likening the experience to \"...something one might expect to see in a Sean Connery 007 movie.\" Unfortunately, approximately four months after the location of the bunker was made public, the interior of the building was destroyed by fire. The fire is thought to have been started by either homeless people taking shelter in the bunker, or vandals. The blaze began on the evening of 9 August and is said to have burned for more than a week.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nIn the early 1970s the [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] handed over the {{convert|9|acre|ha|0|order=flip|adj=on}} site to the [[Department of Housing and Construction (1973\u201375)|Commonwealth Department of Housing]]. In 1976 a [[Defence Housing Authority]] medium density housing scheme, designed by architectural firm Robertson and Hindmarsh Pty Ltd, was constructed on the former ADHQ site. The housing estate was designed to ensure that the underground bunker was located in one of the open spaces of the estate. It was at this time that the above ground, support buildings for the bunker were demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe exact location of the main entry and exit passages into the bunker are not known, as the area over the top and sides of the building has been landscaped concealing the bunker's existence.  However, in the 1980s and 1990s the bunker was entered at  least three occasions. On one such occasion, a film crew from the popular television show ''[[Burke's Backyard]]'', crawled through an air vent into the facility and the television show's host, [[Don Burke]], hosted an episode of the show  from the bunker. Footage from the television show and photographs taken by other individuals who have gained entry to the building indicate that the facility is structurally intact.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Associated buildings===\nAir Board documentation indicates that the Fighter Sector VHF/RT system (Very High Frequency Radio Transmission System) was to comprise: 3 VHF/DF (Direction Finder) fixer stations, 1 VHF/DF homing station, 1 remote (local) transmitting station, 1 remote (local) receiving station and 2 relay stations (each consisting of a receiver and transmitter). In the case of the Sydney ADHQ relay stations were considered unnecessary by Defence authorities as it was anticipated that the height of the sites selected for the new VHF transmitter and receiver stations would ensure satisfactory communications. As it turned out, the new transmitting and receiver stations were never built and the Sydney ADHQ relied on the existing receiving station at [[Picnic Point, New South Wales|Picnic Point]], [[Revesby, New South Wales|Revesby]] and the existing transmitting station at Johnston Street, [[Bass Hill, New South Wales|Bass Hill]].  According to surviving documents radar stations at Robertson, [[Wentworth Falls, New South Wales|Wentworth]] and [[Somersby, New South Wales|Somersby]] were to acted as VHF/DF Fixer stations for the ADHQ.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nOther radar stations known to have passed on information (usually by telephone) to 1FSHQ and therefore probably to the ADHQ, were No. 17 Radar Station located at [[Moruya, New South Wales|Moruya]], No. 18 Radar Station located at [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]], No. 19 Radar Station located at Bombi near [[Gosford]] and No. 101 Radar Station located on [[Sydney Heads|North Head]], Sydney. Information would also have been passed on from No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters at [[Lambton, New South Wales|Lambton]] and No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters at [[Brisbane]].<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Other Fighter Sector Headquarters===\nNo 2. Fighter Sector Headquarters formed at New Lambton NSW on 25 February 1942. The unit commandeered the New Lambton Public School for its operations before moving to Ash Island on the 3 December 1944. No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters was to be responsible for fighter aircraft control and coordination for the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and Hunter region. However it appears that 2FSHQ was non-operational and functioned as a training facility while, located at New Lambton.  There is no indication that a purpose built headquarters (similar to that built in Condell Park) was constructed for this unit.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters was formed at Townsville on 25 February 1942. The unit controlled fighter operations and anti-aircraft defences through North [[Queensland]] and New Guinea. The unit operated from a grammar school at North Ward until a semi underground bunker (identified as such because all the cabling was laid underground), was constructed between 1942 and 1943. The new fighter sector headquarters was built on the lower slopes of [[Mount Stuart, New South Wales|Mount Stuart]] and became fully operational on 20 December 1944. In 1962 or 1963 the interior of the bunker was destroyed by fire.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was formed at Darwin on 25 February, six days after the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces. The unit was responsible for all air operations over northern Australia, from Broome to Cape York. Initially the Fighter Sector Headquarters operated out of tents and then a rough shed at Sandfly Gully, a kilometre south of the Darwin airstrip. At a later date an Operations Room was constructed at Berrimah, 15km east of Darwin. Information provided by men who worked at the site indicates that the building was a semi underground  structure, that initially comprising one room but which was later expanded to two rooms. In the years following the close of WWII the exact location of the Berrimah Operations Room was lost, however, in 1995 a search for the building was initiated and by 1997 intact concrete floors of two adjacent rooms (tentatively identified as those of the Filter Room and Operations Room) had been identified on Berrimah Farm.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 6 Fighter Sector Headquarters was former in Perth on 22 April 1942. An Operations Room was setup in the Alma Street Masonic Hall at Mt. Lawley.  Between January and March 1945 the unit moved into a new underground bunker in Epsom Avenue in [[Belmont, New South Wales|Belmont]], Perth.  The [[Heritage Council of Western Australia]]'s data inventory sheet for the Belmont Bunker, describes the bunker as having moderate to high integrity, with a few alterations taking place to convert the former Fighter Sector Headquarters to a potential operations headquarters for the Civil Defence and Emergency Department (also known as the [[New South Wales State Emergency Service|State Emergency Service]]).<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo 7 Fighter Sector Headquarters, like the other Fighter Sector Headquarters, was formed in haste (on 4 May 1942) and the Operations Room was setup in the [[Preston, Queensland|Preston]] Town Hall, Melbourne.  No. 7 Fighter Sector Headquarters appears to have remained at the Preston Town Hall until February 1946 when it was moved to the RAAF base, Point Cook.  There does not appear to have been a purpose built headquarters (similar to the Condell Park facility) constructed for this unit.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nNo. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters was originally operated by the US Eighth Fighter Group, USAAC. When the 8th Fighter Group was reassigned to Townsville the Fighter Sector Headquarters was briefly taken over by the by the 565th Aircraft Warning Battalion, US Army. The No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters RAAF was formed on 3 August 1942. The unit was located on the 3rd level of the Wills Building in Ann Street Brisbane. The building has since been demolished.<ref name=nswshr-1857/><ref name=NAA>{{cite web|author=|date=|title=No.1 Installation Bankstown|work=[[National Archives of Australia]] |quote=NAA:A705,171/26/31 Pt 1 & 2|url=http://www.naa.gov.au}}</ref><ref>Information supplied by Squadron Leader Dave Burns, Office of the Air Force History</ref><ref name=R&H>{{cite book|author=Robertson & Hindmarsh P/L Architects|date=2006|title=World Wars 1 & 2, Survey of Buildings, Sites and Cultural Landscapes in NSW|number=Bankstown Aerodrome 6B}}</ref><ref name=BankstownVerticle>{{cite book|author=|date=|title=Bankstown City Library Vertical File Local Studies - RAAF Underground Bunker}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rosen, Sue|title=Bankstown: A Sense of Identity|date=|location=|publisher=}}</ref><ref>History of Cinema of Bankstown City by Kevin Cork</ref><ref>Fighter Sector (Darwin): Control of Australia's Air War 1942-45 by Graham Calley</ref><ref name=bankstown>{{cite book|author=Bankstown City Council|date=25 August 2009|title=Item 5.5 Second (WW2) Bunker at Condell Park, Ordinary Meeting of Bankstown City Council }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RAAF Headquarters Bunker Belmont|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au|work=www.ozatwar.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite|title=Operations and Signals Bunker (former)|work=www.heritage.gov.au}}</ref><ref name=Burke>{{cite book|author=Burke, Don|author-link=Don Burke|title=Footage of [[Burke's Backyard]]|publisher=[[CTC (TV station)|CTC Productions]]|date=|location=Australia|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe Former Air Defence Headquarters (ADHQ) occupied a nine-acre site, which was enclosed by a 6 foot high (1.83m) barbwire man proofed camouflaged fence. The eastern half of the site was dissected by a gravel road which ran across the site in a north-south direction. The main entrance to the site was the southern termination of this road. A second entry/exit point was located at the northern end of the gravel road.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe largest structure on the site was a two storey underground bunker from where the air defence of New South Wales was controlled. In addition to the bunker, a 1942 site plan indicates that there were to be five above ground, support structures on the site.  The buildings comprised: an Administration Hut, Rest Room and Kitchen Hut, a Female Latrine, a Male Latrine, and a Motor Transport Garage. The support buildings were located close to the southern boundary of this site, just west of the gravel road.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nToday, the Former Air Defence Headquarters lies under one of the open spaces of a housing estate built on the site in the 1970s. The area over the top and sides of the building has been landscaped concealing the building's existence. The exact location of the main entry and exit passages into the bunker are not known. Images of the interior of the bunker taken in the 1980s and 1990s, indicate that despite the fire that gutted the interior the building is structurally intact.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Detailed description===\nThe following description of the Air Defence Headquarters and above ground, support buildings has been taken largely from a site plan dated 4th November 1942, floor layout and section drawings dated 3rd March 1943, A plan of alterations and additions to the ADHQ (specifically the Gun Room, Army Switch and Test Room) dated 27h August 1943 and the building specification dated circa November 1942.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Support buildings===\nFour of the above ground, support buildings are shown on the 1942 site plan as being grouped around a [[driveway]], which branched off the main gravel road in a westerly direction, near the southern boundary of the site. The fifth building (the Female Latrine) was short distance to the north of the main group.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nAccording to the 1942 site plan, the first buildings encountered along the driveway were the Administration Building on the south side of the driveway with the Rest Room and Kitchen Building directly opposite. Each of the buildings comprised two \"c series\" military huts. The Administration Building (C15 military huts) included office space, a General Masters store and an orderly room.  A kitchen, canteen and store were at the centre of the Rest Room and Kitchen Building (C7 military huts). The Equipment Officer's Room and the officers buffet and rest room were located on one side of the kitchen-canteen complex with the other ranks buffet and rest room  located on the other.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe next building encountered along the driveway was the Male Latrine, which was located on the north side of the driveway and comprised a single \"c series\" (c.12) military hut. The latrine was divided into two areas with the officer's latrine located in the eastern end and facilities for the other ranks located in the western end of the building.  Between the Rest Room and Kitchen Building and the Male Latrine, and to the north of these buildings was the Female Latrine, which also comprised a single 'c series (c.12) military hut.  Unlike the Male Latrine there was no division between officers and other ranks, in facilities provided.  At end of the drive was the garage comprising four posts and [[skillion roof]].<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Air Defence Headquarters===\nThe Former Air Defence Headquarters is a semi-underground bunker that became fully underground after construction.  The building was constructed using a \"cut and fill\" method. The soil excavated from digging the basement level into the natural ground, was used to cover the second-storey which was constructed above ground.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe underground bunker comprised two levels, a ground floor and basement both 9' (2.75m) in height. The exterior walls of the structure were constructed of brick approximately 2' (61cm) in thickness, and were protected with earth filling. The Interior partition walls were mostly constructed of brick and timber and clad with caneite. A visitor to the bunker in the 1970s stated that the interior was painted \"in army colours.\" The ceiling and floors comprised reinforced concrete 4\" (10.2cm) thick. The flat, overhanging concrete roof of the bunker, was at least 18\" (45.7cm) thick and was designed survive a direct hit from a 500 1b bomb. A  3/4\" (1.9cm) thick layer of asphalt was laid over the flat concrete roof as a damp course. The asphalt was then covered by at least 2' 3\" (68.6cm) of earth fill.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe entrance to the bunker appears to have been located approximately midway long the eastern [[facade]] of the bunker and was accessed via concrete passage strategically placed behind an earth embankment. An assessment of the fire protection measures required for the 1FSHQ (both temporary HQ and new building) undertaken in December 1943, noted that there were \"emergency escapes\" at the south and north ends of the building. An exit from the south end of the building from ground floor level, is shown on floor plans of bunker dated March 1943.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Ground floor layout===\nThe floor plan indicates that the ground floor of the bunker is essentially rectangular in shape, with a small rectangular shaped extension attached to the south-west corner of the bunker.  The ground floor measures approximately 97' and 1 1/4\" along its western side (excluding the extension), 54' along its northern end, 97' and 1 1/4\" along its the eastern side and 35' and 4 1/2\" along its southern side (excluding the extension). Equating to an approximate size of 29.60 x 16.46 x 29.60 x 10.78 metres. The rectangular shaped extension measures 20' and 7 1/2\" by 18' and 7 1/2\" (approximately 6.27 x 5.68 metres)<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nAs stated above, entrance to the bunker was gained through the eastern facade of the building. After passing through the concrete passageway a visitor to the bunker would emerge in a light lock, access to the bunker was through a door in the wall immediately in front of them.  Stepping through the door, a visitor would find him or herself confronting a guard, who was no doubt tasked with vetting the identity of anyone who gained access to the bunker. To the left of the entry door stretched an almost 8 metres long corridor which led to the Army Buffet, with access to AWAS Latrine, located at its southern end.  Immediately in front of the entry door (across the passage) was an antechamber. A door in the north wall of the chamber led to the optical angulator.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nAccording the floor plan, if a visitor turned right upon entering the bunker, and followed the corridor as it ran north along the eastern perimeter of the building they would find the Signals Room, which was located in the north-east corner of the bunker. The Signals Room was where incoming communications form the telephone, teleprinters and radar would be sorted before being distributed to the relevant people in the ADHQ.  Turning left at the Signals Room provided access to a corridor that ran almost the length of the northern end of the ground floor.  The first door encountered on the north side of the corridor was the door to the Signals Room, followed by door openings to the Cypher and Intelligence Room (where messages where encoded and decoded when security was required), the P.B.X Switch (private business telephone exchange), RAAF buffet, WAAAF Latrine, RAAF Male Latrine. At the end of the corridor (in the north-west corner of the bunker) was the Post Master General's (PMG)  Frame Room. The PMG was responsible for suppling the telegraphy and telephony cabling to the ADHQ.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe two-storey high Operations Room formed the centrepiece of the bunker.  The floor plan indicate that the Operations Room would have been dominated by a large plotting table on which would have been painted a map with appropriate map references. Plotter (members of the WAAAF) would used plotting table to plot aircraft movements, passed through from the Filter Room.   At the eastern end of the upper part of the Operations Room (ground floor level), was the Controllers Gallery. The Controller was generally a pilot of senior rank who was equipped with telephones and a radio. The radio allowed him to speak directly to fighter aircraft sent to interpret hostile aircraft. A series of four R/T (Radio Telephony) Cabinet Rooms were accessible from the eastern end of the Controllers Gallery.  Projecting out over the western end, of the upper part of the Operations Room, was a small platform, that gave access to indicator boards presumably associated with the Teleprinter and Traffic Room, located immediately behind the platform.  The room immediately adjacent to the south wall of the Teleprinter and Traffic Room housed Emergency Wireless Telegraph/Telephony equipment.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe northern half of the bunker was dominated by the upper part of the two-storey high Volunteer Air Observers Corp (V.A.O.C) and R/D/F (Radar Directional Finder) Filter Rooms.  The Filter Room was where reports of aircraft sighting were \"filtered\" to establish their height and bearing. The Movements Gallery, where all allied aircraft movements in the operational area were recorded, was sandwiched between the upper part of the V.A.O.C R/D/F rooms and the upper part of the Operation Room. The Guns Room (anti-aircraft guns) and the Search-Light Operations Room dominated the southern half of the ground floor of the bunker. Adjacent to the southern wall of the Guns Room was a Army Switch Room (south-west corner of the main section of the bunker) and a Test Room.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nExiting through a door opening in the east wall of the Test Room provided access to a corridor that ran in an east-west direction.  Lining the south side of the corridor were three height converter booths. An additional height converter booth was located on the north side of the corridor. Immediately north of this room was the Search-Light Operations Room. At the eastern end of corridor on north side was the Male Army Latrine.  Immediately north of Latrine was the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) Latrine and Army Buffet mentioned earlier.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nA door opening in the south wall of the Army Switch Room (referred to above) provided access to one of two Air Conditioning Rooms, which occupied the northern end of the small rectangular extension, that projects off the south-western corner of the ground floor of the bunker. To the south of the Air Conditioning Rooms was located the power unit for the bunker and an emergency power generator.  Access to the \"emergency escape\" exit located at the southern end of the bunker, appears to have been though an opening in the south wall of the area housing the emergency power generator.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Basement===\nAccording to the floor plan, the basement measures approximately {{convert|39|ft|3.5|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along its northern end, {{convert|72|ft|5.75|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along its western side, {{convert|69|ft|1|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along the length of the eastern elevation and {{convert|46|ft|5|inch|m|0|order=flip}} along its southern end. The centre of the east elevation of the basement is indented, giving the basement level the appearance of a capitalised letter \"E\" when viewed in plan. The Operations Room dominates the centre of the basement. At the eastern end of the Operations Room was the Intercept Officer's dais. The Intercept Officer was responsible for plotting the best course in intercept enemy aircraft. The V.A.O.C and R/D/F Filter Rooms dominate the northern half of the basement. On the south side of the Operations Room is the Naval Plot Room. The basement floor plan indicates that this room contained a long narrow plot table which occupied almost the entire length of the room.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nInformation provided in the newspaper article written by Phil Engisch, indicates that there may have been was some adjustment to the floor plan of the ADHQ, after the March 1943 plan was produced. Engisch noted in his article that the bunker had toilet and shower facilities (whereas the plans appear to show latrines only). Engisch also recorded the presence of a small number of bedrooms, which are not shown on the 1943 floor plans of the building. It is also possible that these modifications date from the 1960s when the ADHQ was used for naval manoeuvres in the Pacific.<ref name=nswshr-1857/><ref name=NAA/><ref name=bankstown/><ref name=R&H/><ref>Fighter sector (Darwin): Control of Australia's Air War 1942-1945</ref><ref name=Torch>{{cite book|last=Engisch|first=Phil|date=21 April 1971|title=The Torch uncovers secret RAAF war base |work=Cantebury-Bankstown Torch}}</ref><ref name=BankstownVerticle/><ref name=Burke/>\n\n===Condition===\nAs at 13 September 2010, a few months after the existence of the bunker was made public, in April 1971, the interior of the bunker was gutted by fire. The bunker has been accessed on several occasions since the fire.  Peter Treseder, in an article published in the January-March 1994 issue of ''[[Australian Geographic]]'', claimed that in 1987 he entered the bunker. Treseder described the bunker as being \"...a blackened shell with lots of rooms and passages running off at various levels.\"  A group known as the Bunker Boyz entered the bunker in {{circa|1996}}. Photographs of members of the group inside the bunker show the bunker to be structurally intact. Currently, there is no access to the interior of bunker.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\nThe interior of the bunker was destroyed by fire. Currently there is no access into the bunker, however images of the interior of the building indicate that it is structurally intact.<ref name=nswshr-1857/>\n\n===Inside the bunker===\n[[Image:Inside bbunker.jpg|thumb|left|Inside one of the bunker hallways]]\nThe Bankstown Bunker was of similar design to the underground Ops rooms of wartime England, which directed Britain's air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German [[Luftwaffe]]. Entrance to the bunker was obtained via a concrete passageway concealed beneath a grassy slope with corridors and hallways leading to various sections.<ref>(information supplied by R. Eyers [[Volunteer Air Observers Corps (Australia)|VAOC]] worker)</ref>\n\nThe walls of the bunker were 1.5 metres thick<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.bunkerboyz.org/bankbunk2.htm|title=Teenagers raid bunker|publisher=BunkerBoyz.org|access-date=1 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829224351/http://www.bunkerboyz.org/bankbunk2.htm|archive-date=29 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and it could almost withstand a direct hit from a {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on}} bomb. It had all the attenuated fixtures necessary to run a top secret operational defence base. It consisted of three Fixer Stations and one [[Homing beacon|Homing Station]]. There were switchboards directing up to fifty telephone lines that went to various locations including radar stations and VAOC lookout posts which reported aircraft locations to the bunker. The bunker was also equipped with its own code room, plotting rooms, two escape tunnels and a radio transmitter room. In the centre of the bunker was a large room of about two stories in height. This was the main Ops room and control centre for all RAAF Missions in the Pacific area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/SUB/SUB-09.htm |title=Subterranean Sydney |publisher=Sydney Architecture |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> The room also had a large map, (24' x 18') denoting troop positions in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II]].\n\nThe facilities inside the bunker also had to cater for the full-time staff who lived and worked in the facility, working on a rotating roster that involved living in the bunker for two-week periods. The living quarters consisted of its own kitchen, dining area, bathrooms and bedrooms. The bunker also had its own generator and air conditioning.<ref name=jlbmlm>{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Joan |author2=Madden, Brian|author3=Muir, Lesley|title=Pictorial History of Canterbury Bankstown|date=September 1999|publisher=Kingsclear Books|url=http://www.kingsclearbooks.com.au/cb.html|isbn=0-908272-55-3 }}</ref>{{rp|89}}\n\nThere are rumours of a tunnel running from the bunker to an unknown location.<ref>{{cite news|first= Merle|last=Peters|authorlink=|title=Historian's account|url=|work=|publisher=Bankstown Torch Newspaper|date=20 January 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Modifications and dates===\nA fire that started on 9 August 1971 destroyed the interior of the bunker. The air vents, electricity and wireless telegraphy/telephony poles mounted on the roof of the bunker were removed in association with the 1976 redevelopment of the site by the Commonwealth Department of Housing.  The above ground, support buildings were also demolished as part of the redevelopment of the site in the 1970s.<ref name=nswshr-1857/><ref name=R&H/>\n\n==Location==\nThere is a small reserve between the town houses at the end of Taylor Street. It is under this hill that the bunker has been buried. The entrance to the bunker has now been sealed and the area over the top of the bunker has been landscaped to conceal its position, to the point where it is completely undetectable from the street.\n\n===Other bunkers in the City of Bankstown===\n[[Image:Bankstown01.jpg|thumb|The remote receiving station. Map date 17 February 1942.]]\n[[Image:Chullora railway workshop, New South Wales.JPG|thumb|Chullora Railway Workshops and former site of WWII manufacturing plant.]]\nThere is one other confirmed bunker, a \"Remote Receiving station\", in Bankstown.<ref>[http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/bunkers/bankstownremotereceivingbuilding.htm Bankstown Remote Receiving Building, Bankstown, New South Wales, during WW2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Little is known about its history though it was reportedly \"heavily vandalised\" in 1945. It was located in [[Picnic Point, New South Wales|Picnic Point]] National Park, near the South Sydney Power station.<ref>see map \u2013 [[:Image:Bankstown01.jpg]]</ref> According to residents of the area, it still exists. Based on a comparison of contemporary and historic maps, the Receiving Station and the present day Sydney South electricity substation share the same footprint, with the latter apparently situated directly above the former. The substation is bounded on its southwestern and southeastern sides by Henry Lawson Drive, in the [[Georges River National Park]]. It is alleged that there are several other bunkers in the Bankstown area, such as under an electricity block house on the corner of Milperra Road and Henry Lawson Drive, and a demolished bunker under Condell Park High School.\n\nDuring World War II, Bankstown was a hive for military activity. Bankstown Airport was home to several fighter units and several \"dummy houses\" existed in and around Bankstown Airport. These houses were built to make Bankstown Airport and its surrounds appear as a farm. Military personnel who worked in Bankstown lived in the area around Chapel Road (where Paul Keating Park and the council chambers are located today).  Training facilities for the various plotting rooms around Sydney were also located in the area.\n\nDuring World War II a major wartime manufacturing plant was located in [[Chullora, New South Wales|Chullora]]. The site once occupied {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of land surrounded by [[Rookwood Cemetery]], Brunker Road, the [[Hume Highway]] and Centenary Drive. The site was said to have been the largest secret manufacturing plant in Australia which was used for the production of military weapons, plane components, tanks, and ordnance. Over two-thousand men and woman were employed to work at the factory on a daily basis. During the war the factory produced components for 700 Beaufort, 380 Beaufighter and up to 50 Lincoln aircraft. Over 54 ACI tanks were built as well as 60 General Lee tanks that were adapted for use in the Australian Military, as were local jeeps in the 70s. The factory also produced 81 cupola [[Gun turret|turrets]] for the British Matilda tanks.<ref name=jlbmlm />{{rp|91\u201392}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ozatwar.com/bunkers/chullorabunker.htm | title= Chullora \"Bunker\" and underground Tunnels. Were they used during WW2? }}</ref>\n\nAn underground \"bunker\" and tunnel system is apparently located on this site. It is directly under a block of flats in Davidson Street and Marlene Crescent. The entrance to the \"bunker\" is by steel doors set in concrete into the hillside in a railway cutting which runs from alongside the railway line parallel to Marlene Crescent at a platform called the Railwelders and which leads under the block of flats. The doors to this \"bunker\" were welded up in the late 1980s. The ventilation shafts that were once visible from the [[Hume Highway]] have been removed.\n\nApart from the bunker, there is also a network of storage facilities that extend under the railway workshop. Sometime between 1977 and 1978 the steel access doors were fitted with locks (Railway SL type). The steel access doors were bolted into the side of a stormwater drain which runs along the old [[Roads and Traffic Authority|RTA]] building in Chullora, then under the Hume Hwy and eventually under the rail workshop. It has also been alleged that a tunnel approximately four miles long connects this complex with the Bankstown Bunker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westernsydneybunkers.webs.com/chulloramunitionssite.htm |title=Chullora Munitions Site \u2013 Western Sydney Bunkers |publisher=Westernsydneybunkers.webs.com |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301103549/http://westernsydneybunkers.webs.com/chulloramunitionssite.htm |archive-date=1 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Representation in popular culture==\nThe Bankstown Bunker was featured on an episode of ''[[Burke's Backyard]]''.
