Their fourth meeting was arguably the match of the year, in the [[2017 Rogers Cup]] quarterfinals, where Wozniacki stormed back from 1\u20135 down in the first set and break down in the third set to take the victory. One week later, the pair met in the [[2017 Western & Southern Open]] quarterfinals where Pliskova dispatched a tired Wozniacki from making the final of Toronto the previous week. At the semifinal stage of the [[2017 WTA Finals]], Wozniacki won a marathon first set propelling her to a straight sets victory over Pliskova, and eventually lifting the title. The last meeting in 2018 occurred at the round robin of the [[2018 WTA Finals]] where Wozniacki was upset in straight sets.<ref>{{cite

It has a primary focus on science, engineering and technology, but still retains a strong interest in the arts and humanities.\n\nIn 1958, a trust was established with [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] as its chairman of trustees, to build and endow a college for 60 fellows and 540 students as a national and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] memorial to Winston Churchill; its Royal Charter and Statutes were approved by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], in August 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/foi/schemes/Churchill_College_introduction_part_1_v2.pdf|title=Churchill College, Cambridge - Publication Scheme|accessdate=5 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607170546/http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/foi/schemes/Churchill_College_introduction_part_1_v2.pdf|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is situated on the outskirts of [[Cambridge]], away from the traditional centre of the city, but close to the University's main [[West Cambridge|new development zone]] (which now houses the [[Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge)|Centre for Mathematical Sciences]]), which some would argue is the new city centre. Its {{convert|16|ha}} of grounds make it physically the largest of all the colleges.\n\nChurchill was the first all-male college to decide to admit women, and was among three men's colleges to admit its first women students in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dick-tizard-510308.html|title=Dick Tizard, Obituary|accessdate=5 February 2010|work=The Independent|location=London|date=10 October 2005}}</ref> Within 15 years all others had followed suit. The college has a reputation for relative informality compared with other Cambridge colleges, and traditionally admits a larger proportion of its undergraduates from state schools.\n\nThe college motto is \"Forward\". It was taken from the final phrase of Winston Churchill's first speech to the House of Commons as Prime Minister \u2013 his famous \"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat\" speech \u2013 in which he said \"Come, then, let us go forward together\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchillconferences.co.uk/college.htm|title=Churchill College Hospitality - About Churchill College|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1955, on holiday in [[Sicily]] soon after his resignation as prime minister, Winston Churchill discussed with [[Jock Colville|Sir John Colville]] and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Lord Cherwell]] the possibility of founding a new institution. Churchill had been impressed by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and wanted a British version, but the plans evolved into the more modest proposal of creating a science and technology-based college within the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Walsh, James Jackson|title=Postgraduate Technological Education in Britain: Events Leading to the Establishment of Churchill College, Cambridge, 1950-1958|doi=10.1023/A:1004396018945|year=1998|journal=Minerva|volume=36|issue=2|pages=147\u2013177}}</ref> Churchill wanted a mix of non-scientists to ensure a well-rounded education and environment for scholars and fellows. The college therefore admits students to read all subjects except [[land economy]] and theology & religious studies (though it is possible to switch to these subjects later).\n\nThe first postgraduate students arrived in October 1960, and the first undergraduates a year later. Full college status was received in 1966. Initially all students were male. Women were not accepted as undergraduates until 1972.\n\nThe bias to science and engineering remains as policy to the current day, with the statutes requiring approximately 70% science and technology students amongst its student intake each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/official/statutes_and_ordinances/statutes.pdf|title=Churchill College Statutes (PDF)|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> The college statutes also stipulate that one third of the students of the college should be studying for postgraduate qualification.\n\n[[Cambridge University Radio]] (later [[Cam FM]]) broadcast from Churchill College from 1979 until 2011.\n\n== Buildings and grounds ==\nIn 1958, a 42-acre (170,000 m\u00b2) site was purchased to the west of the city centre, which had previously been farmland. After a competition, [[Richard Herbert Sheppard|Richard Sheppard]] was appointed to design the new college.  Building was completed by 1968 with nine main residential courts, separate graduate flats and a central building consisting of the dining hall, buttery, combination rooms and offices.\n\nThe dining hall is the largest in Cambridge.  It measures 22m square, 9m to the base of the vault beams, and 11.6m to the highest point. It can cater for up to 430 guests in a formal dining arrangement.\n\nThe main college buildings and courtyards are arranged around a large central space, in which the library was placed. Only a few years later, being opened in 1974, an extension to the library building was added to house the Churchill Archives Centre. Its original purpose was to provide a home to Sir Winston's papers, however since then it has been endowed with papers from other political figures including former Prime Ministers [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]], as well as former Leader of the Opposition [[Neil Kinnock]], and those of eminent scientists and engineers including [[Reginald Victor Jones]], [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Frank Whittle|Sir Frank Whittle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/|title=Churchill Archive Centre|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:8118899-exterior3-max.jpg|thumb|The M\u00f8ller Centre for Continuing Education]]\nIn 1992, the [[Moller Centre|M\u00f8ller Centre for Continuing Education]] was built on the Churchill site, designed by [[Henning Larsen]]. It is a dedicated residential executive training and conference centre, aiming to bring together education and commerce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mollercentre.co.uk|title=The M\u00f8ller Centre|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs well as the main College buildings, Sheppard designed a separate group of flats, known as the Sheppard flats, for the use of married graduate students. These are located to one side of the College grounds, a short distance from the main buildings.\n\n=== Chapel ===\nAt the farthest end of the college grounds is the Chapel. Sheppard's original design placed it within the main building complex near the college main entrance.<ref>Goldie, M.; ''Corbusier Comes to Cambridge'', Churchill (2007).</ref> The idea of having a religious building within a modern, scientifically-oriented academic institution deeply annoyed some of the original fellows, leading to the resignation of [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Francis Crick]] in protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/Views/Exhibit/narrative/biographical.html|title=The Francis Crick Papers: Biographical Information|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> Eventually a compromise was found: the chapel was sited just to the west of the Sheppard Flats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/visitors/map_of_college.php|title=Churchill College: Information: Map of College|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> and funded and managed separately from the rest of the College itself, being tactfully referred to as \"the Chapel ''at'' Churchill College\". The chimney of the heating system at the front of the college substitutes visually for the missing chapel tower.\n\nCrick had agreed to become a fellow on the basis that no chapel be placed at Churchill. A donation was later made by [[Lord Beaumont of Whitley]] to Churchill College for the establishment of one, and the majority of fellows voted in favour of it. Sir Winston Churchill wrote to him saying that no-one need enter the chapel unless they wished to do so, and therefore it did not need to be a problem. Crick, in short order, replied with a letter dated 12 October 1961 accompanied by a [[cheque]] for 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] saying that, if that were the case, the enclosed money should be used for the establishment of a [[brothel]]. This story was repeated by Crick in an interview with [[Matt Ridley]] (Crick's biographer<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/17/scienceandnature.biography|title=Observer review: Francis Crick by Matt Ridley|accessdate=5 February 2010|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Robin|last=McKie|date=17 September 2006}}</ref>), quotes from which are reported in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3306329/Do-our-genes-reveal-the-hand-of-God.html|title=Do our genes reveal the hand of God?|accessdate=5 February 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first=Roger|last=Highfield|date=20 March 2003}}</ref>\n\n=== Artworks and sculptures ===\n[[File:Churchill College, Hepworth.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barbara Hepworth|Hepworth]]'s ''[[Four-Square (Walk Through)]]'' (1966) is large enough for many students to work and play on\u2014which they are allowed to do]]\n[[File:Lynn Chadwick Geograph-685492-by-Fractal-Angel.jpg|thumb|''Beast Alerted 1'', by British sculptor [[Lynn Chadwick]]]]\n\nThe college contains many examples of modern artwork including:\n* ''[[Four-Square (Walk Through)]]'' (1966) \u2013 [[Barbara Hepworth|Dame Barbara Hepworth]]\n* Prints of [[Marilyn Monroe]] \u2013 [[Andy Warhol]]\n* ''Gemini'' (1973) \u2013 [[Denis Mitchell (sculptor)|Denis Mitchell]]\n* ''Diagram of an Object (Second state)'' (1990)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sculpture.org.uk/image/618830211087/43/|title=Dhruva Mistry|accessdate=5 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205025343/http://www.sculpture.org.uk/image/618830211087/43/|archivedate=5 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> \u2013 [[Dhruva Mistry]]\n* ''Spiral'' \u2013 Michael Gillespie (1993)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/685470|title=Geograph:: Spiral, Michael Gillespie, 1991 (C) Fractal Angel|publisher=Geograph.org|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>\n* ''Flight'' \u2013 [[Peter Lanyon]] (1981)\n* ''Black Bag'' \u2013 [[Graham Murdoch]] (1990)\n\nThere are also works by [[Eduardo Paolozzi|Sir Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]],  and [[Daphne Hardy Henrion]].\n\nMistry's piece can be found at the front of college.

The name Pav originates from the pavilion buildings of the college where the event was originally held. Since 1992, Pav has been held in the Buttery, the main bar area.\n\nIn the early years of the college's foundation, the college held a ball in [[May Week]], in common with many older colleges. However, more recently Churchill has held a Spring Ball every February, close to [[Valentine's Day]]. The Ball has hosted a number of upcoming bands, such as [[The Wombats]] (2007) and [[The Noisettes]] (2008).\n\nDuring [[May Week]] the JCR organise a free [[garden party]]. The event hosts performances from local bands and musicians.\n\nStudents of the College run Churchill Casino,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchillcasino.co.uk|title=Churchill Casino|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> a Cambridge-based enterprise which provides professional casinos at various social events. Churchill Casino is frequently hired for [[May Ball|Cambridge May Balls]] as well as balls at the [[University of Oxford]] and corporate events throughout the country.

It has relatively few traditions. Informal hall (cafeteria-style dining period) was introduced in 1971, as an alternative to formal hall (fixed time, waiter service, all diners wearing gowns), but students are no longer required to wear [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|gowns]] at formal halls,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcr.chu.cam.ac.uk/useful-stuff/faq/#Formals|title=Churchill College MCR Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> with exception of certain college feasts.\n\nIn special formal meals such as Matriculation Dinner or Scholars' Feast the Master usually raises a toast, first to [[Queen of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] and then to \"Sir Winston\". In other [[Formal Hall|formal halls]] this is usually made by a senior student once the [[fellow]]s have left. This latter tradition started in the early 2000s with the students customarily toasting in the reverse order: \"Sir Winston\", followed by \"The Queen\".\n\n== People associated with the college ==\n\n=== Masters ===\nThe Mastership of Churchill College is a [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] appointment.

It has a primary focus on science, engineering and technology, but still retains a strong interest in the arts and humanities.\n\nIn 1958, a trust was established with [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] as its chairman of trustees, to build and endow a college for 60 fellows and 540 students as a national and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] memorial to Winston Churchill; its Royal Charter and Statutes were approved by the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]], in August 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/foi/schemes/Churchill_College_introduction_part_1_v2.pdf|title=Churchill College, Cambridge - Publication Scheme|accessdate=5 February 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607170546/http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/foi/schemes/Churchill_College_introduction_part_1_v2.pdf|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is situated on the outskirts of [[Cambridge]], away from the traditional centre of the city, but close to the University's main [[West Cambridge|new development zone]] (which now houses the [[Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge)|Centre for Mathematical Sciences]]), which some would argue is the new city centre. Its {{convert|16|ha}} of grounds make it physically the largest of all the colleges.\n\nChurchill was the first all-male college to decide to admit women, and was among three men's colleges to admit its first women students in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dick-tizard-510308.html|title=Dick Tizard, Obituary|accessdate=5 February 2010|work=The Independent|location=London|date=10 October 2005}}</ref> Within 15 years all others had followed suit. The college has a reputation for relative informality compared with other Cambridge colleges, and traditionally admits a larger proportion of its undergraduates from state schools.\n\nThe college motto is \"Forward\". It was taken from the final phrase of Winston Churchill's first speech to the House of Commons as Prime Minister \u2013 his famous \"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat\" speech \u2013 in which he said \"Come, then, let us go forward together\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchillconferences.co.uk/college.htm|title=Churchill College Hospitality - About Churchill College|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1955, on holiday in [[Sicily]] soon after his resignation as prime minister, Winston Churchill discussed with [[Jock Colville|Sir John Colville]] and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Lord Cherwell]] the possibility of founding a new institution. Churchill had been impressed by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and wanted a British version, but the plans evolved into the more modest proposal of creating a science and technology-based college within the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Walsh, James Jackson|title=Postgraduate Technological Education in Britain: Events Leading to the Establishment of Churchill College, Cambridge, 1950-1958|doi=10.1023/A:1004396018945|year=1998|journal=Minerva|volume=36|issue=2|pages=147\u2013177}}</ref> Churchill wanted a mix of non-scientists to ensure a well-rounded education and environment for scholars and fellows. The college therefore admits students to read all subjects except [[land economy]] and theology & religious studies (though it is possible to switch to these subjects later).\n\nThe first postgraduate students arrived in October 1960, and the first undergraduates a year later. Full college status was received in 1966. Initially all students were male. Women were not accepted as undergraduates until 1972.\n\nThe bias to science and engineering remains as policy to the current day, with the statutes requiring approximately 70% science and technology students amongst its student intake each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/official/statutes_and_ordinances/statutes.pdf|title=Churchill College Statutes (PDF)|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> The college statutes also stipulate that one third of the students of the college should be studying for postgraduate qualification.\n\n[[Cambridge University Radio]] (later [[Cam FM]]) broadcast from Churchill College from 1979 until 2011.\n\n== Buildings and grounds ==\nIn 1958, a 42-acre (170,000 m\u00b2) site was purchased to the west of the city centre, which had previously been farmland. After a competition, [[Richard Herbert Sheppard|Richard Sheppard]] was appointed to design the new college.  Building was completed by 1968 with nine main residential courts, separate graduate flats and a central building consisting of the dining hall, buttery, combination rooms and offices.\n\nThe dining hall is the largest in Cambridge.  It measures 22m square, 9m to the base of the vault beams, and 11.6m to the highest point. It can cater for up to 430 guests in a formal dining arrangement.\n\nThe main college buildings and courtyards are arranged around a large central space, in which the library was placed. Only a few years later, being opened in 1974, an extension to the library building was added to house the Churchill Archives Centre. Its original purpose was to provide a home to Sir Winston's papers, however since then it has been endowed with papers from other political figures including former Prime Ministers [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]], as well as former Leader of the Opposition [[Neil Kinnock]], and those of eminent scientists and engineers including [[Reginald Victor Jones]], [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Frank Whittle|Sir Frank Whittle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/archives/|title=Churchill Archive Centre|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:8118899-exterior3-max.jpg|thumb|The M\u00f8ller Centre for Continuing Education]]\nIn 1992, the [[Moller Centre|M\u00f8ller Centre for Continuing Education]] was built on the Churchill site, designed by [[Henning Larsen]]. It is a dedicated residential executive training and conference centre, aiming to bring together education and commerce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mollercentre.co.uk|title=The M\u00f8ller Centre|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAs well as the main College buildings, Sheppard designed a separate group of flats, known as the Sheppard flats, for the use of married graduate students. These are located to one side of the College grounds, a short distance from the main buildings.\n\n=== Chapel ===\nAt the farthest end of the college grounds is the Chapel. Sheppard's original design placed it within the main building complex near the college main entrance.<ref>Goldie, M.; ''Corbusier Comes to Cambridge'', Churchill (2007).</ref> The idea of having a religious building within a modern, scientifically-oriented academic institution deeply annoyed some of the original fellows, leading to the resignation of [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Francis Crick]] in protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/Views/Exhibit/narrative/biographical.html|title=The Francis Crick Papers: Biographical Information|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> Eventually a compromise was found: the chapel was sited just to the west of the Sheppard Flats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/about/visitors/map_of_college.php|title=Churchill College: Information: Map of College|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> and funded and managed separately from the rest of the College itself, being tactfully referred to as \"the Chapel ''at'' Churchill College\". The chimney of the heating system at the front of the college substitutes visually for the missing chapel tower.\n\nCrick had agreed to become a fellow on the basis that no chapel be placed at Churchill. A donation was later made by [[Lord Beaumont of Whitley]] to Churchill College for the establishment of one, and the majority of fellows voted in favour of it. Sir Winston Churchill wrote to him saying that no-one need enter the chapel unless they wished to do so, and therefore it did not need to be a problem. Crick, in short order, replied with a letter dated 12 October 1961 accompanied by a [[cheque]] for 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] saying that, if that were the case, the enclosed money should be used for the establishment of a [[brothel]].

The former contains undergraduates and the latter postgraduates (known as ''advanced students''). Fourth year undergraduates studying towards their [[Master's degree in Europe#Undergraduate Master's Courses|Masters]] may choose to be in either.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcr.chu.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=25#Advanced_Student|title=Churchill MCR: What is an Advanced Student?|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> These student bodies organise various academic and social events as well as handling issues regarding welfare. The college funds sports clubs and societies which provide entertainment for students.\n\n[[File:Students on Hepworth, Churchill College.jpg|thumb|right|Students relaxing on 'The Hepworth' following a formal]]\n\n=== Social events ===\nEvery two weeks of the Michaelmas and Lent terms, and twice in Easter term, Churchill is host to Pav, a music event unusual for Cambridge events in that it is free and open to all university members. The name Pav originates from the pavilion buildings of the college where the event was originally held. Since 1992, Pav has been held in the Buttery, the main bar area.\n\nIn the early years of the college's foundation, the college held a ball in [[May Week]], in common with many older colleges. However, more recently Churchill has held a Spring Ball every February, close to [[Valentine's Day]]. The Ball has hosted a number of upcoming bands, such as [[The Wombats]] (2007) and [[The Noisettes]] (2008).\n\nDuring [[May Week]] the JCR organise a free [[garden party]]. The event hosts performances from local bands and musicians.\n\nStudents of the College run Churchill Casino,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchillcasino.co.uk|title=Churchill Casino|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> a Cambridge-based enterprise which provides professional casinos at various social events. Churchill Casino is frequently hired for [[May Ball|Cambridge May Balls]] as well as balls at the [[University of Oxford]] and corporate events throughout the country.

The club is noted for its pink boats.]]\nWith playing fields on site, unlike many other colleges, sport is an integral part of the college. As well as football pitches, a cricket pitch and others, the facilities include a gym, and tennis and squash courts.\n\nChurchill College Football Club (CCFC) were the first college team to retain the Cambridge University Amateur Football League Division 1 title, winning it in 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307. In the 2006\u20132007 season they also reached the final of [[Cuppers]].{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe College also has a successful boat club ([[Churchill College Boat Club]]) which in 2013 won the [[Pegasus Cup]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miltonbrewery.co.uk/pegasus-cup/2013.html|title=Pegasus Cup 2013 \u2014 The Milton Brewery, Cambridge Ltd|publisher=The Milton Brewery, Cambridge Ltd|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> (This trophy is awarded annually to the most successful college boat club competing in the Cambridge May Bumping Races<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cucbc.org/handbook/pegasus_cup|title=Pegasus Cup - CUCBC|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>). In 2015, Churchill College Boat Club made history by being the first boat club at the university to win both the Pegasus Cup and Marconi Cup (This award is present to the most successful college boat club in the Lent Bumps) in the same year.\n\n== Traditions ==\n[[File:Dining Hall, Churchill 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill's Dining Hall is the largest in Cambridge.]]\nChurchill is a relatively young college, and prides itself on being modern and forward looking. It has relatively few traditions. Informal hall (cafeteria-style dining period) was introduced in 1971, as an alternative to formal hall (fixed time, waiter service, all diners wearing gowns), but students are no longer required to wear [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|gowns]] at formal halls,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcr.chu.cam.ac.uk/useful-stuff/faq/#Formals|title=Churchill College MCR Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> with exception of certain college feasts.\n\nIn special formal meals such as Matriculation Dinner or Scholars' Feast the Master usually raises a toast, first to [[Queen of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] and then to \"Sir Winston\". In other [[Formal Hall|formal halls]] this is usually made by a senior student once the [[fellow]]s have left. This latter tradition started in the early 2000s with the students customarily toasting in the reverse order: \"Sir Winston\", followed by \"The Queen\".\n\n== People associated with the college ==\n\n=== Masters ===\nThe Mastership of Churchill College is a [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] appointment.

A [[New Age]] interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era.<ref name=\"anasatas\" /> Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe.

Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],<ref name=\"delara2006\" /> it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&nbsp;AD.<ref name=\"Population structure of the classic period Maya\" /> The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,<ref name=\"joyce\" /> meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n|European conquest]].\n\nUnlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk\u02bcin]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k\u02bcatun'', and 20 k\u02bcatuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b\u02bcak\u02bctun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b\u02bcak\u02bctuns, 3 k\u02bcatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}<ref name=\"The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0\" />\n\n=== Apocalypse ===\n[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]\n\nThere is a strong tradition of \"world ages\" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc people|K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429\u2013430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed.

Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. \"We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this.\"<ref name=\"The Sky Is Not Falling\" /> Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xult\u00fan]], one archaeologist said \"The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&nbsp;\u2013 that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset.\"<ref name=\"NG120510\" />\n\nSeveral prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Ind\u00edgenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle \"supposes changes in human consciousness\". Mart\u00edn Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuradur\u00eda de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.<ref name=\"prensalibre\" />\n\n=== Prior associations ===\nThe European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profec\u00edas]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the \"Maia\" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hoopes 2011</ref> Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of \"most distant\" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst F\u00f6rstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.<ref>F\u00f6rstemann 1906: 264</ref> His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],<ref>Morley 1915: 32</ref> who directly paraphrased F\u00f6rstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, \"Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm\" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Maya references to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 ==\nIt is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.\n\n=== Tortuguero ===\nThe [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ahau. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:\n{{verse translation|lang=myn|\ntzuhtzjo\ua789m uy-u\ua789xlaju\ua789n pik\nchan ajaw u\ua789x uni\ua789w\nuhto\ua789m il[?]\nye\u02bcni/ye\ua789n bolon yokte'\nta chak joyaj\n|\nIt will be completed the 13th ''b\u02bcak\u02bctun''.\nIt is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K\u02bcank\u02bcin''\nand it will happen a 'seeing\u02bc[?].\nIt is the display of ''B\u02bcolon-Yokte'''\nin a great \"investiture\".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun with the appearance of B\u02bcolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]\n\nVery little is known about the god B\u02bcolon Yokte\u02bc. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements \"nine\", \u02bcOK-te\u02bc (the meaning of which is unknown), and \"god\". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.<ref name=\"eberl2005\" /> He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.<ref name=\"hieroglyphic\" />\n\nBased on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36\u201337}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh with b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as \"erection of stelae, scattering of incense\" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.<ref name=\"What Will Not Happen in 2012\" />\n\n=== La Corona ===\nIn April\u2013May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k\u02bcatuns with the future completion of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.<ref name=\"Stuart 2012\">{{cite web | title = Notes on a New Text from La Corona | first = David | last = Stuart | url = http://decipherment.wordpress.com/ | year = 2012 | accessdate = 6 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Dates beyond b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 ===\nMaya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun. Most of these are in the form of \"distance dates\"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K\u02bcinich Janaab\u02bc Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but \"to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism\".<ref name=\"skepsis\" /> Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a \"disconnected\" society: \"Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time\u2014entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge.\"{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1975, the ending of b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global \"transformation of consciousness\".

By 1987, the year in which he organized the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology''.<ref name=\"Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration\" /><ref name=\"elles1987\" /> He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a \"galactic synchronization beam\" that emanated from the [[Galactic Center|center of our galaxy]], that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 ''tuns'' (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in \"total synchronization\" and \"galactic entrainment\" of individuals \"plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery\" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17\u201327}}\n\nIn 2001, Robert Bast wrote the first online articles regarding the possibility of a doomsday in 2012.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010515214545/http://www.survive2012.com Survive2012.com homepage]</ref> In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].<ref name=\"Pinchbeck 2006\" /><ref name=\"The End of the World As They Know It\" /> Pinchbeck claims to discern a \"growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic\".<ref name=\"anasatas\" />\n\n=== Galactic alignment ===\nThere is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].<ref name=\"Hoopes2009\" /><ref name=\"Hoopes2012\" /> Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a \"galactic alignment\".\n\n==== Precession ====\nIn the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations, and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called \"[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]\", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.<ref name=\"prec\" /> Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.<ref name=\"prec\" /> In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115\u2013127}}\n\nSimilarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].<ref name=\"Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center\" /> Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.<ref name=\"What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?\" /> In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].<ref name=\"starry\" /> In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.<ref name=\"Questions and comments\" />\n\n==== Mysticism ====\n[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or \"Black Road\"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]\n\nMystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975).\n\nAdherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or \"Black Road\".<ref name=\"Xibalba or Xibalbe\" /> John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.<ref name=\"The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness\" /> New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.<ref name=\"pinchbeck2006\" /> Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].<ref name=\"jenkins1998\" /> Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a \"world tree\", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}\n\n==== Criticism ====\nAstronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.<ref name=\"jenk\" /><ref name=\"The True Alignment Zone\" /><ref name=\"meeus1997\" />\n\nThere is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,<ref name=\"grofe2011\" /> Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,<ref name=\"jenkins2009\" /> have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.<ref name=\"van\" /> There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.<ref name=\"van\" /><ref name=\"Aimers, J.

To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc\u2014as it does every 20\u201325&nbsp;million years\u2014it comes under the influence of the far stronger \"disc tides\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.<ref name=\"Perturbing the Oort Cloud\" /> However, this \"alignment\" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.<ref name=\"Galactic Plane\" /> Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.<ref name=\"The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane\" />\n\nA third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.<ref name=\"Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers\" /> Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.<ref name=\"Planetary Alignment\" /> [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above \u2248300&nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined.

Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b\u02bcak\u02bctuns, 3 k\u02bcatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}<ref name=\"The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0\" />\n\n=== Apocalypse ===\n[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]\n\nThere is a strong tradition of \"world ages\" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc people|K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429\u2013430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed.

Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Ind\u00edgenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle \"supposes changes in human consciousness\". Mart\u00edn Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuradur\u00eda de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.<ref name=\"prensalibre\" />\n\n=== Prior associations ===\nThe European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profec\u00edas]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the \"Maia\" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hoopes 2011</ref> Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of \"most distant\" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]].

He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.<ref>F\u00f6rstemann 1906: 264</ref> His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],<ref>Morley 1915: 32</ref> who directly paraphrased F\u00f6rstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, \"Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm\" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Maya references to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 ==\nIt is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.\n\n=== Tortuguero ===\nThe [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ahau. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 in any detail.

He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]\n\nVery little is known about the god B\u02bcolon Yokte\u02bc. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements \"nine\", \u02bcOK-te\u02bc (the meaning of which is unknown), and \"god\". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.<ref name=\"eberl2005\" /> He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.<ref name=\"hieroglyphic\" />\n\nBased on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36\u201337}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh with b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as \"erection of stelae, scattering of incense\" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.<ref name=\"What Will Not Happen in 2012\" />\n\n=== La Corona ===\nIn April\u2013May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k\u02bcatuns with the future completion of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.

Most of these are in the form of \"distance dates\"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K\u02bcinich Janaab\u02bc Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93\u201395}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.<ref name=\"van\" />{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93\u201395}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}\n\nAnother example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b\u02bcak\u02bctun.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but \"to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism\".<ref name=\"skepsis\" /> Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a \"disconnected\" society: \"Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time\u2014entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge.\"{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1975, the ending of b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global \"transformation of consciousness\".

He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17\u201327}}\n\nIn 2001, Robert Bast wrote the first online articles regarding the possibility of a doomsday in 2012.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010515214545/http://www.survive2012.com Survive2012.com homepage]</ref> In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].<ref name=\"Pinchbeck 2006\" /><ref name=\"The End of the World As They Know It\" /> Pinchbeck claims to discern a \"growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&nbsp;...

From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations, and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called \"[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]\", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.<ref name=\"prec\" /> Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.<ref name=\"prec\" /> In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115\u2013127}}\n\nSimilarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].<ref name=\"Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center\" /> Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.<ref name=\"What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?\" /> In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].<ref name=\"starry\" /> In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.<ref name=\"Questions and comments\" />\n\n==== Mysticism ====\n[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or \"Black Road\"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]\n\nMystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975).\n\nAdherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or \"Black Road\".<ref name=\"Xibalba or Xibalbe\" /> John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.<ref name=\"The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness\" /> New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.<ref name=\"pinchbeck2006\" /> Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].<ref name=\"jenkins1998\" /> Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a \"world tree\", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}\n\n==== Criticism ====\nAstronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.<ref name=\"jenk\" /><ref name=\"The True Alignment Zone\" /><ref name=\"meeus1997\" />\n\nThere is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,<ref name=\"grofe2011\" /> Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,<ref name=\"jenkins2009\" /> have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.<ref name=\"van\" /> There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.<ref name=\"van\" /><ref name=\"Aimers, J.

To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc\u2014as it does every 20\u201325&nbsp;million years\u2014it comes under the influence of the far stronger \"disc tides\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.<ref name=\"Perturbing the Oort Cloud\" /> However, this \"alignment\" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.<ref name=\"Galactic Plane\" /> Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.<ref name=\"The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane\" />\n\nA third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.<ref name=\"Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers\" /> Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.<ref name=\"Planetary Alignment\" /> [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above \u2248300&nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined.

In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world.

The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k\u02bcatuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}<ref name=\"The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya\" />\n* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.<ref name=\"joyce\" />\n* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than \"0.0.0.0.0\", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as \"13.0.0.0.0\"<ref name=wagner/>\n* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the \"GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation\" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&nbsp;BC and the end date of b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 at 21 December 2012.<ref name=\"Who's Who in the Maya World\" /> This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the \"Lounsbury/GMT+2\" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December.

The restructured screenplay by [[Graham Greene]], directed by [[Otto Preminger]], begins with the play's last scene, which then becomes the springboard for a long flashback, from which the main story is told. At the end of the flashback, the film then returns to the play's final scene, which then continues through to the end.\n\nThis was the film debut of actress [[Jean Seberg]], who won a talent search conducted by Preminger that reportedly tested more than 18,000 young women for the role.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1456, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] ([[Richard Widmark]]), experiences dreams in which he is visited by Joan of Arc ([[Jean Seberg]]), the former commander of his army, burned at the stake as a heretic twenty-five years earlier. In the dream he tells Joan that her case was retried and her sentence annulled. He recalls how she entered his life as a simple, seventeen-year-old peasant girl; how she heard the voices of Saints [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]] and [[Margaret of Antioch|Margaret]] telling her that she would lead the French army against the English at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] and be responsible for having the Dauphin crowned king at [[Reims cathedral]]. When Joan arrives at the Dauphin's palace at [[Chinon]] she discovers that he is a childish weakling with no interest in fighting. After being tested by the members of the court, who conclude that she is mad, Joan imbues the Dauphin with her belief and fervor and he gives her command of the army.\n\nShortly thereafter, Joan witnesses the coronation of Charles. Although her military triumphs have made her popular with the masses, her voices, beliefs, self-confidence and apparent supernatural powers have given her fearful enemies in high places. Charles, who has no further use for her services, expects her to return to her father's farm. When Joan challenges Charles to retake Paris from the English, he tells her he would rather sign a treaty than fight. All refuse Joan's plea to march on Paris, and the archbishop warns her that if she defies her spiritual directors, the church will disown her. Nevertheless, Joan puts her faith in God and appeals to the common people to march on Paris. She is captured and handed over to the English. To assure that Joan will never again become a threat to England, the English commander hands her over to the Catholic Church to be tried for heresy. Joan spends four months in a cell and is visited frequently by the Inquisitor ([[Felix Aylmer]]). The English become impatient with the delay in her prosecution and press for the trial to begin. Joan holds to her faith, as always, refusing to deny that the church is wiser than she or her voices.\n\nIn a moment of panic when she learns she is to be burned at the stake, and worn down by the constant pressures applied by the Inquisitor, Joan signs a document of recantation in which she confesses that she pretended to hear revelations from God and the saints in the belief that this will result in her freedom to return to her life as a peasant girl. When she learns that the sentence of the Inquisition is her perpetual, solitary imprisonment, Joan destroys the document, refusing to face a life away from nature, the life that opened her spirit to hear God and the saints. She now believes that God wants her to come to him through the ordeal of being burned at the stake. After Joan is excommunicated, the English commander, weary of the Church's endless and delaying rituals, decides that Joan can be executed long before the Vatican learns about it, and so orders his soldiers to drag her to the square to be burned. The Inquisitor chooses to look the other way and let the English burn her. Those who witness Joan's death are stricken with remorse. The King's dream continues as he and Joan are visited by other significant figures from her life. Growing weary of all the spirit visitors, Charles tells Joan he has dreamed of her long enough and returns to his bed and his troubled sleep.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as [[Charles VII of France|The Dauphin, later Charles VII]]\n* [[Jean Seberg]] as [[Joan of Arc|St. Joan of Arc]]\n* [[Richard Todd]] as [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois, Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans]]\n* [[Anton Walbrook]] as [[Pierre Cauchon|Peter Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais]]\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[Felix Aylmer]] as Inquisitor\n* [[Archie Duncan (actor)|Archie Duncan]] as [[Robert de Baudricourt]]\n* [[Harry Andrews]] as John de Stogumber\n* [[Margot Grahame]] as Duchesse de la Tremouille\n* [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as De Courcelles\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] as [[Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille]]\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Archbishop of Rheims\n* [[Victor Maddern]] as English Soldier\n* [[Bernard Miles]] as Master Executioner\n* [[David Oxley]] as [[Gilles de Rais|Gilles de Rais (\"Bluebeard\")]]\n* [[Patrick Barr]] as  [[La Hire|Captain La Hire]]\n\n==Critical reaction==\nSeveral reviews, including two in ''[[The Times]]'', noted that Greene's condensation of the play resulted in <blockquote>\n\"some odd omissions, interpolations and additions\" and that \"the result is a certain scrappiness and confusion in the first half of the film in place of Shaw's slow and careful build-up.\"\n</blockquote> Other reviewers complained that an epilogue Shaw wrote was used as a prologue and recurring scene throughout the film.

The restructured screenplay by [[Graham Greene]], directed by [[Otto Preminger]], begins with the play's last scene, which then becomes the springboard for a long flashback, from which the main story is told. At the end of the flashback, the film then returns to the play's final scene, which then continues through to the end.\n\nThis was the film debut of actress [[Jean Seberg]], who won a talent search conducted by Preminger that reportedly tested more than 18,000 young women for the role.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1456, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] ([[Richard Widmark]]), experiences dreams in which he is visited by Joan of Arc ([[Jean Seberg]]), the former commander of his army, burned at the stake as a heretic twenty-five years earlier. In the dream he tells Joan that her case was retried and her sentence annulled. He recalls how she entered his life as a simple, seventeen-year-old peasant girl; how she heard the voices of Saints [[Catherine of Alexandria|Catherine]] and [[Margaret of Antioch|Margaret]] telling her that she would lead the French army against the English at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] and be responsible for having the Dauphin crowned king at [[Reims cathedral]]. When Joan arrives at the Dauphin's palace at [[Chinon]] she discovers that he is a childish weakling with no interest in fighting. After being tested by the members of the court, who conclude that she is mad, Joan imbues the Dauphin with her belief and fervor and he gives her command of the army.\n\nShortly thereafter, Joan witnesses the coronation of Charles. Although her military triumphs have made her popular with the masses, her voices, beliefs, self-confidence and apparent supernatural powers have given her fearful enemies in high places. Charles, who has no further use for her services, expects her to return to her father's farm. When Joan challenges Charles to retake Paris from the English, he tells her he would rather sign a treaty than fight. All refuse Joan's plea to march on Paris, and the archbishop warns her that if she defies her spiritual directors, the church will disown her. Nevertheless, Joan puts her faith in God and appeals to the common people to march on Paris. She is captured and handed over to the English. To assure that Joan will never again become a threat to England, the English commander hands her over to the Catholic Church to be tried for heresy. Joan spends four months in a cell and is visited frequently by the Inquisitor ([[Felix Aylmer]]). The English become impatient with the delay in her prosecution and press for the trial to begin. Joan holds to her faith, as always, refusing to deny that the church is wiser than she or her voices.\n\nIn a moment of panic when she learns she is to be burned at the stake, and worn down by the constant pressures applied by the Inquisitor, Joan signs a document of recantation in which she confesses that she pretended to hear revelations from God and the saints in the belief that this will result in her freedom to return to her life as a peasant girl. When she learns that the sentence of the Inquisition is her perpetual, solitary imprisonment, Joan destroys the document, refusing to face a life away from nature, the life that opened her spirit to hear God and the saints. She now believes that God wants her to come to him through the ordeal of being burned at the stake. After Joan is excommunicated, the English commander, weary of the Church's endless and delaying rituals, decides that Joan can be executed long before the Vatican learns about it, and so orders his soldiers to drag her to the square to be burned. The Inquisitor chooses to look the other way and let the English burn her. Those who witness Joan's death are stricken with remorse. The King's dream continues as he and Joan are visited by other significant figures from her life. Growing weary of all the spirit visitors, Charles tells Joan he has dreamed of her long enough and returns to his bed and his troubled sleep.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Widmark]] as [[Charles VII of France|The Dauphin, later Charles VII]]\n* [[Jean Seberg]] as [[Joan of Arc|St. Joan of Arc]]\n* [[Richard Todd]] as [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois, Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans]]\n* [[Anton Walbrook]] as [[Pierre Cauchon|Peter Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais]]\n* [[John Gielgud]] as [[Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[Felix Aylmer]] as Inquisitor\n* [[Archie Duncan (actor)|Archie Duncan]] as [[Robert de Baudricourt]]\n* [[Harry Andrews]] as John de Stogumber\n* [[Margot Grahame]] as Duchesse de la Tremouille\n* [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as De Courcelles\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] as [[Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille]]\n* [[Finlay Currie]] as Archbishop of Rheims\n* [[Victor Maddern]] as English Soldier\n* [[Bernard Miles]] as Master Executioner\n* [[David Oxley]] as [[Gilles de Rais|Gilles de Rais (\"Bluebeard\")]]\n* [[Patrick Barr]] as  [[La Hire|Captain La Hire]]\n\n==Critical reaction==\nSeveral reviews, including two in ''[[The Times]]'', noted that Greene's condensation of the play resulted in <blockquote>\n\"some odd omissions, interpolations and additions\" and that \"the result is a certain scrappiness and confusion in the first half of the film in place of Shaw's slow and careful build-up.\"\n</blockquote> Other reviewers complained that an epilogue Shaw wrote was used as a prologue and recurring scene throughout the film.

Accessed August 9, 2018. \"'I was born in Atlantic City, at the hospital there, and raised in Ocean City until I was 12 years old.' Burnley explained his family moved to Pennsylvania when he was 12 due to an increase in taxes at the shore town.\"</ref> At 16, he became home schooled and quickly passed the GED requirement. At 21 he moved to [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], where he became a roommate of former Breaking Benjamin bass player Jonathan Price. During his early teen years he taught himself to play guitar by listening to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' (he cites Nirvana as his biggest influence). Before Breaking Benjamin was formed, Ben Burnley earned money playing cover songs, mixed in with his own in various coffee houses and other all age venues mostly with local neighboring musicians.\n\n===Breaking Benjamin===\n{{Main|Breaking Benjamin}}\n\nIn 1998, Burnley and former lead guitarist Aaron Fink, got together (along with Nick Hoover and Chris Lightcap) and started the band \"Breaking Benjamin.\" Eventually, Ben wanted to try something different and went out to California to try some new material. The other three members went on to form the band [[Lifer (band)|Strangers With Candy]] (later known as [[Lifer (band)|Lifer]]). They recruited old friend Mark Klepaski to play bass and he joined in, and shortly after, Nick Hoover was asked to leave the band.\n\nIn 1999, Ben Burnley moved back to Pennsylvania, and started a band called \"Plan 9\" with drummer Jeremy Hummel. Originally, the band was a three-piece. The lineups consisted of Benjamin on vocals and electric guitar, Jeremy on drums, and Jason Davoli on bass.

Accessed August 9, 2018. \"'I was born in Atlantic City, at the hospital there, and raised in Ocean City until I was 12 years old.' Burnley explained his family moved to Pennsylvania when he was 12 due to an increase in taxes at the shore town.\"</ref> At 16, he became home schooled and quickly passed the GED requirement. At 21 he moved to [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], where he became a roommate of former Breaking Benjamin bass player Jonathan Price. During his early teen years he taught himself to play guitar by listening to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' (he cites Nirvana as his biggest influence). Before Breaking Benjamin was formed, Ben Burnley earned money playing cover songs, mixed in with his own in various coffee houses and other all age venues mostly with local neighboring musicians.\n\n===Breaking Benjamin===\n{{Main|Breaking Benjamin}}\n\nIn 1998, Burnley and former lead guitarist Aaron Fink, got together (along with Nick Hoover and Chris Lightcap) and started the band \"Breaking Benjamin.\" Eventually, Ben wanted to try something different and went out to California to try some new material. The other three members went on to form the band [[Lifer (band)|Strangers With Candy]] (later known as [[Lifer (band)|Lifer]]). They recruited old friend Mark Klepaski to play bass and he joined in, and shortly after, Nick Hoover was asked to leave the band.\n\nIn 1999, Ben Burnley moved back to Pennsylvania, and started a band called \"Plan 9\" with drummer Jeremy Hummel. Originally, the band was a three-piece. The lineups consisted of Benjamin on vocals and electric guitar, Jeremy on drums, and Jason Davoli on bass. Plan 9 would occasionally open for Lifer at home shows. During one show, Ben said \"Thank you, we're Breaking Benjamin,\" thus reclaiming the name from 1998.
