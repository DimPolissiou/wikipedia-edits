Alongside [http://peterstopschinski.com/ Peter Stopschinski], another composer-bandleader that was a part of the burgeoning rock and punk scene of Austin, Graham began to apply the collective creation and self-production methods of the rock scene to the world of classical music. Golden Hornet formed, starting with Six Pieces for String Quartet (1999), performed by Tosca String Quartet. Collaborations with Austin Lyric Opera, Glenn Kotche, local high school orchestras, and many others followed, ranging from percussion pieces to Shostakovich.

The organization has reached over 1500 audience members, contracted over eighteen local musicians, commissioned work from seven celebrated composers, and fostered the commissioning of five new works. Upcoming endeavor The Sound of Science, features works from the likes of [[Paola Prestini]], [[Yuka Honda]], Maja S.K. Ratjke, Felipe P\u00e9rez Santiago, and [[Foday Musa Suso]]. \n\n==Compositions==\nReynolds output includes five symphonies, two operas, string quartets, and numerous chamber music pieces, in addition to the work with Golden Arm Trio and in film, dance, and theater.\n\n==Film==\nAfter many experimental shorts and several live scores for silent films, Graham\u2019s first feature film score was The Journeyman (2001), a grim, Sergio Leone-inspired western featuring Willie Nelson. His relationship with iconic independent film director [[Richard Linklater]] (Slacker, Dazed and Confused, School of Rock), started with a simple piano score for the documentary short, \u201cLive from Shiva\u2019s Dance Floor\u201d in 2003. Not long after, Linklater asked Graham to score [[A_Scanner_Darkly_(film)|A Scanner Darkly]] (2006), which Linklater was adapting from the Philip K. Dick novel. [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Woody Harrelson]], and [[Winona Ryder]] starred in the rotoscoped film. The score, which featured acoustic instruments and electric guitar processed through computer effects, was declared \u201cBest Soundtrack of the Decade\u201d by Cinema Retro Magazine. Completing and releasing A Scanner Darkly changed Graham\u2019s life, propelling his musical career forward. A consistent number of collaborations with Linklater have followed: Bernie (2011) starring [[Jack Black]], which required totally different music - hymns, strings, country; [[Up to Speed]] (2012), starring Speed Levitch and broadcast by Hulu; Before Midnight (2013), the third of Linklater\u2019s romantic trilogy featuring [[Julie Delpy]] and [[Ethan Hawke]], which premiered at Sundance.<ref>[http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=19782 \"Film Music Magazine\"]</ref> Graham has also continued work with a variety of other collaborators apart from Linklater, including [[The Diplomat]] (2015) for HBO and Rooster Teeth\u2019s series [[Day 5]] (2016-2017). <ref>[http://www.lightscameraaustin.net/graham-reynolds-august-2016.html \"Lights Camera Austin\"]</ref> Beyond his scoring work with major collaborators, Graham has composed and performed several live scores for silent films, including [[Battleship Potemkin]](1925), [[Nosferatu]] (1922), Wings (1927), Metropolis (1927) and Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s The Lodger (1927). \n\n==Theater==\nMuch in the same way as his collaborations in dance, Graham has narrowed in on two consistent key partners in theatre. While his presence in theatre started with lights in high school, and expanded into various work throughout Austin, his first collaboration with Rude Mechanicals (Rude Mechs) was In The House of Moles (2000), a relationship which blossomed into his current company membership with them, since 2003. He composed the original score and designed sound for the Creative Capital Award Winning The Method Gun (2007), The Lincoln Center commission Stop Hitting Yourself (2014), and the Yale Repertory commission Field Guide (2017). In total, the relationship has resulted in ten complete works <ref>[https://rudemechs.com/aboutus/whoweare/ \"Rude Mechs\"]</ref>. Simultaneously, his relationship with Salvage Vanguard Theater also developed, from Cry Pitch Carrolls (1999), the first in a series of collaborations with Ruth Margraff, and [[The Intergalactic Nemesis]] (2000), which split off from the company and had nearly a decade of international touring, deepening the network and connections with presenters <ref>[https://www.salvagevanguard.org/about \"Salvage Vanguard\"]</ref>. \n\n==Dance==\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Graham\u2019s work in the world of dance started with short experimental collaborations with the Ellen Bartel Dance Collective, which then grew into several projects with Andrea Ariel. He has since worked consistently with two key partners. With choreographer [[Stephen Mills]] of [[Ballet Austin]]<ref>[https://www.texasobserver.org/mr-reynolds-opus/ \"Texas Observer\"]</ref>, he has scored, through both recorded and live performance methods, six large scale works, including: Cult of Color, a collaboration with visual artist [[Trenton Doyle Hancock]], Belle Redux,  and Bounce, which toured through seventeen cities across China. His collaborations with Allison Orr of Forklift Danceworks started in 2009, with The Trash Project; the documentary directed by Andy Garrison following the project took the work national, while other projects, such as Play Ball Kyoto, have traveled internationally. Most recently, Graham provided live scoring for the MAP Award Winning and NEA funded My Park, My Pool, My City series as well as Served, each building on Orr\u2019s socially-engaged practices. Music for dance is a realm of passion for Graham, resulting from the life-long influence of several of the Diaghilev commissioned ballets; works that lived beyond their initial intent but continue to tell a story. \n\n== Collaborations ==\nGraham Reynolds has collaborated with different artists and filmmakers including [[Richard Linklater]], [[Rooster Teeth]], [[Ballet Austin]], Forklift Danceworks, Rude Mechs, Salvage Vangard Theater, Dionysium and more.\n\n==Community work involvement ==\nGolden Hornet, City of Austin Music Commission<ref>[https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2020/04/music-commission-backs-council-proposal-to-unlock-4-5m-to-aid-artists-venues/ \"Austin Monitor\"]</ref>, Austin Chamber Music Center\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=December 2013}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070430005135/http://cornellsun.com/node/23178 Graham Reynolds Interview and Feature Article]\n*[http://grahamreynolds.com Graham Reynolds' official site]\n*[http://www.goldenarmtrio.net/ Golden Arm Trio's official site]\n*{{IMDb name|1199960}}\n*[https://archive.org/details/GrahamReynoldsOnOutsightRadioHours Interviews on Outsight Radio Hours]\n*[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Archive/author?oid=oid%3A181005 ''Austin Chronicle'' articles by Graham Reynolds]\n*[http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=189512489 A podcast interview]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} with [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001944/http://www.hoorayforhumans.org/ Hooray for Humans] on ''[[iTunes]]''.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reynolds, Graham}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male musicians]]\n[[Category:American musicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{rewrite|date=January 2019}}\n{{unreferenced BLP|date=April 2019}}\n{{coi|date=January 2019}}\n{{promo|date=January 2019}}\n{{Original research|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Graham Reynolds\n| image                 = [[File:Graham Reynolds Studio.jpg|thumb]]\n| birth_name          = Graham Eric Reynolds\n| birth_date                = {{birth date|1971|3|5|mf=y}}\n|birth_place =[[Frankfurt, Germany]] (U.S. Army Base)\n| instrument          = [[Piano]], [[Drum kit|drums]]\n| occupation          = [[Bandleader]], [[Pianist]], [[Composer]]\n| years_active        = 1995\u2013present\n| website       = http://www.grahamreynolds.com/\n| background=non_vocal_instrumentalist\n}}\n    \n'''Graham Eric Reynolds''' is an [[Austin, Texas]]-based composer-bandleader-improviser.<ref>[https://austinchambermusic.org/people/graham-reynolds   \u201cAustin Chamber Music Center\u201d]</ref> He holds a Creative Capital Award, an Independent Music Award, two Frederick R.

He was fluent in 7 languages and as many dialects.\n\nNeibaur was born in 1808 to Nathan and Rebecca Peretz Neibaur in [[Ehrenbreitstein Fortress|Ehrenbreitstein]], near [[Koblenz]]. Because that area had been incorporated into France by Napoleon, Neibaur's father served as a surgeon in the Army of France.\n\nNeibaur was first educated to be a rabbi but concluded to become a surgeon and dentist. He received a degree to that end in 1827, before his 20th birthday. Neibaur converted to Christianity approximately two years later.  He moved to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], England, in 1830.

He was educated for the profession at the University of Berlin and was a skilled dentist before the establishment of dental schools in America. He was fluent in 7 languages and as many dialects.\n\nNeibaur was born in 1808 to Nathan and Rebecca Peretz Neibaur in [[Ehrenbreitstein Fortress|Ehrenbreitstein]], near [[Koblenz]]. Because that area had been incorporated into France by Napoleon, Neibaur's father served as a surgeon in the Army of France.\n\nNeibaur was first educated to be a rabbi but concluded to become a surgeon and dentist. He received a degree to that end in 1827, before his 20th birthday. Neibaur converted to Christianity approximately two years later.  He moved to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], England, in 1830. On 15 September 1834, Neibaur married Ellen Breakel, who was from a [[Church of England]] family.<ref>{{citation |last= Carpenter |first= Ellen Wilde |date= July 17, 2011 |title= The Story of Ellen Breakel Neibaur |url= http://www.neibaur.org/journals/ellen.htm |work= neibaur.org }}</ref>\n\nIn 1837 he was converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints faith after reading the [[Book of Mormon]] in three days, but was persuaded to delay his baptism until the following spring that he might be more prepared for the ordinance. He was baptized into the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]<!-- Do not change this name to \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\". In original name of this sect changed from \"Church of Christ\" (April 6, 1830) to the Church of the Latter Day Saints (1834) to Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (1838).

There are two models: the A4000/040 released in October 1992 with a [[Motorola 68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and the A4000/030 released in April 1993 with a [[Motorola 68EC030]].\n\nThe Amiga 4000 system design was generally similar to that of the A3000, but introduced the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) chipset with enhanced graphics. The [[SCSI]] system from previous Amigas was replaced by the lower-cost [[Parallel ATA]].\n\nThe original A4000 is housed in a beige horizontal desktop box with a separate keyboard. Later, Commodore released an expanded tower version called the [[Amiga 4000T|A4000T]].\n\n==Technical information==\n\n=== Processor and RAM ===\nThe stock A4000 shipped with either a [[Motorola 68EC030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], 2&nbsp;MB of [[Amiga Chip RAM]] and up to 16&nbsp;MB of additional RAM in 32-bit [[SIMM]]s.<ref name=\"a4000_user\">{{citation | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032230/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-06-13 | title=A4000 User's Guide | publisher=Commodore Electronics Limited | year=1992 }}</ref> There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the \"chip RAM\" to 8MB.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/amiga/a4000jumpers.html | title=A4000 Motherboard Jumpers | accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher-rated [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and [[PowerPC]] CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher-capacity RAM (128&nbsp;MB or greater).\n\n===A4000-CR version===\nUnlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the [[motherboard]] does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] RAM [[surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad battery]]. The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nThe A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4,096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 ([[hold-and-modify|HAM-8]]) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the [[original Amiga chipset#Audio features in general|Paula sound chip]]), namely, four [[direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\n\n===Peripherals and expansion===\nThe A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors, including two [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] ports for [[joystick]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[light pen]]s, a standard 25-pin [[RS-232]] [[serial port]] and a 25-pin [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]]. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as [[MIDI]] devices, serial [[modem]]s and [[sampling (signal processing)|sound samplers]].<ref name=\"a4000_user\"/>\n\nLike the just-earlier Amiga model, the [[Amiga 3000|3000]], the A4000 has four internal 32-bit [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the [[AutoConfig]] standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] controllers.<ref name=\"zorro3\">{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | access-date=2 September 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212151/http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | archive-date=16 July 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial [[desktop video]] production of [[standard-definition]] [[broadcast quality]] video, consisting of tools for [[vision mixer|video switching]], [[chroma key]]ing, [[character generator|character generation]], [[animation]], and [[image manipulation]].\n\nThe three [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board [[IBM PC Compatible|IBM-PC-compatible]] hardware, including [[Intel 80286]], [[80386]], or [[80486]] microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.\n\nLater, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide [[peripheral component interconnect|PCI]] slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.\n\n===Operating system===\nThe A4000 shipped with [[AmigaOS version history#Amiga_OS_3.0,_3.1|AmigaOS 3.0]], consisting of Workbench 3.0 and [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]], a [[PowerPC]]-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a [[PowerUP (accelerator)#CyberStorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] board is installed. Likewise, [[MorphOS]], an alternative Amiga-compatible operating system, can be used with this hardware.\n\nVariants of platform-independent operating systems, such as [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], can also be used with the A4000.\n\n[[File:A4000 \u00f6ppen.png|right|thumb|Amiga 4000 with case open]]\n[[File:Amiga A3200 A3400 CPU card.jpg|thumb|Amiga A3200/A3400 CPU card]]\n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Later, Commodore released an expanded tower version called the [[Amiga 4000T|A4000T]].\n\n==Technical information==\n\n=== Processor and RAM ===\nThe stock A4000 shipped with either a [[Motorola 68EC030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], 2&nbsp;MB of [[Amiga Chip RAM]] and up to 16&nbsp;MB of additional RAM in 32-bit [[SIMM]]s.<ref name=\"a4000_user\">{{citation | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032230/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-06-13 | title=A4000 User's Guide | publisher=Commodore Electronics Limited | year=1992 }}</ref> There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the \"chip RAM\" to 8MB.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/amiga/a4000jumpers.html | title=A4000 Motherboard Jumpers | accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher-rated [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and [[PowerPC]] CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher-capacity RAM (128&nbsp;MB or greater).\n\n===A4000-CR version===\nUnlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the [[motherboard]] does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] RAM [[surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad battery]]. The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nThe A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 ([[hold-and-modify|HAM-8]]) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the [[original Amiga chipset#Audio features in general|Paula sound chip]]), namely, four [[direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\n\n===Peripherals and expansion===\nThe A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors, including two [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] ports for [[joystick]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[light pen]]s, a standard 25-pin [[RS-232]] [[serial port]] and a 25-pin [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]]. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as [[MIDI]] devices, serial [[modem]]s and [[sampling (signal processing)|sound samplers]].<ref name=\"a4000_user\"/>\n\nLike the just-earlier Amiga model, the [[Amiga 3000|3000]], the A4000 has four internal 32-bit [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the [[AutoConfig]] standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] controllers.<ref name=\"zorro3\">{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | access-date=2 September 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212151/http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | archive-date=16 July 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial [[desktop video]] production of [[standard-definition]] [[broadcast quality]] video, consisting of tools for [[vision mixer|video switching]], [[chroma key]]ing, [[character generator|character generation]], [[animation]], and [[image manipulation]].\n\nThe three [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board [[IBM PC Compatible|IBM-PC-compatible]] hardware, including [[Intel 80286]], [[80386]], or [[80486]] microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.\n\nLater, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide [[peripheral component interconnect|PCI]] slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.\n\n===Operating system===\nThe A4000 shipped with [[AmigaOS version history#Amiga_OS_3.0,_3.1|AmigaOS 3.0]], consisting of Workbench 3.0 and [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]], a [[PowerPC]]-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a [[PowerUP (accelerator)#CyberStorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] board is installed. Likewise, [[MorphOS]], an alternative Amiga-compatible operating system, can be used with this hardware.\n\nVariants of platform-independent operating systems, such as [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], can also be used with the A4000.\n\n[[File:A4000 \u00f6ppen.png|right|thumb|Amiga 4000 with case open]]\n[[File:Amiga A3200 A3400 CPU card.jpg|thumb|Amiga A3200/A3400 CPU card]]\n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

However, in her biography \"Harriet Jacobs: A Life\" (New York 2004), Yellin consistently uses the name \"Harriet Jacobs\" without any middle name or middle initial.

His widow, Elizabeth Horniblow, continued running the tavern and at first also kept Molly Horniblow and her children as her slaves. She gave Molly's daughter Delilah to her own invalid and unmarried daughter Margaret, who in consequence became the first owner of Delilah's children Harriet and John; Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;6.</ref> Under the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', both Harriet and her brother [[John S. Jacobs|John]] were enslaved at birth by the tavern keeper's family, as a mother's status was passed to her children. Still, according to the same principle mother and children should have been free, because Molly Horniblow, Delilah's mother, had been freed by her white father, who also was her owner. But she had been kidnapped, and had no chance for legal protection because of her dark skin. Harriet and John's father was named Elijah Knox.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She and her brother John also used that name after having escaped from slavery. The baptism was conducted without the knowledge of Harriet's master, Dr. Norcom. Harriet was convinced that her father should have been called Jacobs because his father was Henry Jacobs, a free white man.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in [[Boston]]. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone [[whaling]] and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph's arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis's nanny.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>\nHer work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, which where the strength of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] guaranteed a certain level of security.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;74.</ref> Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer's cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;68-69, 74.</ref>\n\nIn Boston Jacobs took on odd jobs.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;77-78, 87.</ref> Her stay there was interrupted by the death of Mary Stace Willis in March 1845. Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She didn't notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the USA. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;83\u201387.</ref>\n\n== The Autobiography ''Incidents in the Life of A Slave Girl''  ==\n''This section is about the genesis of Jacobs's autobiography, seen as part of the story of her life. For the content and an analysis of the autobiography, see the article [[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.\n\n==== Background: Abolitionism and early feminism ====\n\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, journalist, and editor of The Liberator LCCN2017660623 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|William Lloyd Garrison]]\nJohn S. Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i.&nbsp;e. the anti-slavery movement led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolistionists, among them [[Frederick Douglass]], three years his junior.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the ''Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room'' in [[Rochester, New York]]. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;102-103.</ref>\n\nThe former \u201eslave girl\u201c who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The ''Reading Room'' was in the same building as the newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple [[Amy and Isaac Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rrlc.org/winningthevote/biographies/amy-post/ |title=Amy Post |publisher=Rochester Regional Library Council |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref> Douglass and the Posts were staunch enimies of slavery and racism, and supporters of [[women's suffrage]]. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the world's first convention on women's rights, and had signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which demanded equal rights for women.\n\n==== Obtaining legal freedom ====\n\nIn 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis's second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive \"chattels\", she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013110.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis's) one-year old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other slave mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Written by Herself |date= |pages=291 |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/jacobs.html#jac291 |access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1852, Jacobs read in the newspaper that her legal owner, the daughter of the recently deceased Dr. Norcom, had arrived at a New York Hotel together with her husband, obviously intending to re-claim their fugitive slave. Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs's freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that \"a human being [was] ''sold'' in the free city of New York\", happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and \"love\" and \"gratitude\" for Cornelia Willis.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: \"Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;104.</ref>\n\nIn late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs's brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\nStill, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, shared including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.<ref>Transcribed in the appendix to Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself. Cambridge 2000, p.&nbsp;253\u2013255. Summarized in Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\n==== Writing of the manuscript ====\nAt first, Jacobs didn't feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe's answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs's daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe's remark on Louisa with bitter irony: \"what a pity we poor blacks can[']t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.\" In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe's help.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;119\u2013121; Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself.

Written by [[Julia Tyler]], wife of former president [[John Tyler]], the text claimed that the household slaves were \"well clothed and happy\". Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Her letter,<ref>{{citation|title=LETTER FROM A FUGITIVE SLAVE. Slaves Sold under Peculiar Circumstances |date= |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support16.html |access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> signed \"A Fugitive Slave\", published on June 21, was her first text to be printed. Her biographer, [[Jean Fagan Yellin]], comments, \"When the letter was printed ..., an author was born.\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;122-123.</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother's death.<ref>The date of Molly Horniblow's burial in Edenton was September 4, 1853, Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, note to p.124 on p.306.</ref> Yellin concludes that the \"death of her revered grandmother\" made it possible for Jacobs to \"reveal her troubled sexual history\" which she could never have done \"while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;124\u2013126.</ref>\n\nWhile using the little spare time a children's nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today,<ref>\"... when N.P.Willis is mentioned today it is generally as a footnote to some else's story.\"; Baker, Thomas N. Sentiment and Celebrity: Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Yellin comments on the irony of the situation: \"Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer's retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children's nurse who would create an American classic there\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;126.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1857 her work was finally nearing completion and she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: \"as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book \u2013Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it \u2013 that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self\u2013.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;135.</ref>\n\n==== Searching for a publisher ====\n[[File:John Brown. Meeting the slave-mother and her child on the steps of Charlestown jail on his way to execution LCCN2003674588.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Abolitionist drawing of a scene that probably never happened: John Brown meets a slave mother and her child while being led to execution]]\nIn May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn't able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain's prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1859 the anti-slavery activist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] tried to incite a slave rebellion at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]]. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs's second attempt to get her story printed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n==== Lydia Maria Child as the book's editor ====\nJacobs now contacted [[Thayer and Eldridge]], who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown.<ref>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown by James Redpath.</ref> Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she \"resolved to make my last effort\".<ref>Jacobs to Post, October 8, 1860, cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140 and note on p.314.</ref>\n\nJacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested to drop the final chapter on Brown, and to add more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion]]. During this work she kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;140-142.</ref>\n\nAfter the book had been [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;142-143.</ref>\n\nIn January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled ''A True Tale of Slavery'', in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.\n\nIn her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn't mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called \"William\" in his sister's book) mentions Edenton as his birth place and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is \"Dr. Flint\" in Harriet's book, but \"Dr. N-\" in John's. An author's name is not given on the title page, but the \"Preface by the author\" is signed \"Linda Brent\" and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.\n\n==== Reception of the book ====\nThe book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;151-152.</ref>\n\nThe publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda\", thereby conceding her the honorific \"Mrs.\" which normally was reserved for married women.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> The ''[[The Daily News (UK)|London Daily News]]'' wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true \"heroine\", giving an example \"of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty\" and \"moral rectitude\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;152.</ref>\n\n=== Civil War and Reconstruction ===\n==== Relief work and politics ====\n[[File:The Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.jpg|thumb|right|Heroicized painting of the famous assault on [[Fort Wagner]] by the 54th Massachusetts, July 1863.]]\n[[File:Slave pen. Interior view01468v.jpg|thumb|left|Slave pen of an unnamed trader in Alexandria, Virginia. Photograph from the 1860s. Jacobs describes her visit to Birch's (formerly [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield's]]) slave pen in her report ''Life among the Contrabands''.]]\nAfter the [[1860 United States presidential election|election]] of president [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] in November 1860, the slavery question caused first the secession of most slave states and then the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Thousands of African Americans, having escaped from slavery in the South, gathered just north of the front. Since Lincoln's administration continued to regard them as their masters' property, these refugees were in most cases declared \"contraband of war\" and simply called \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|Contrabands]]\". Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the ''Contrabands'' would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and neighboring [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled ''Life among the Contrabands'', published in September in Garrison's ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. The author was featured as \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of 'Linda'\". This report is a description of the fugitives' misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the [[freedman|freedmen]] will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.<ref>{{citation|title=Life among the Contrabands|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support5.html|access-date=December 22, 2019\n}}. Summary of the report in: Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nDuring the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of ''Incidents'' to build up a network to support her relief work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;161-162.</ref> The ''New York Friends'' (i.e. the [[Quakers]]) gave her credentials as a relief agent.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;164.</ref>\n\nFrom January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker [[Julia Wilbur]], the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]],<ref>For the symbolic and political value of this regiment cf. David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, pp.&nbsp;388\u2013402, especially p.&nbsp;398.</ref> consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: \"How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !\" <ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n==== The Jacobs School ====\n[[File:Jacobs School 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs and their students in front of the Jacobs School, Alexandria, Virginia, 1864]]\nIn most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the ''Jacobs School'' opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda's leadership. In the ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised \"to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters\", to develop \"respect for their race\".<ref>H.Jacobs to L.M.Child, published in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', entitled {{citation|title=Letter from Teachers of the Freedmen|date=April 16, 1864|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support4.html|access-date=December 31, 2019\n}}; cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;177. For the context, pp.&nbsp;176-178.</ref>\n\nJacobs's work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the ''[[Women's Loyal National League]]'', a women's organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which aimed at collecting signatures for a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] to abolish slavery.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;175\u2013176.</ref> On August 1, 1864 she delivered the speech on occasion of the celebration of the [[Emancipation of the British West Indies|British West Indian Emancipation]]<ref>A celebration introduced by the abolitionists in order to demonstrate the backwardness of the US in comparison with the British colonies.</ref> in front of the African American soldiers of a military hospital in Alexandria. Many abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass,<ref>David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, p.&nbsp;418. This is the only time Jacobs is mentioned in this book, while Douglass is mentioned on 30 different pages in Yellin, Harriet Jacobs (according to the index).</ref> stopped over in Alexandria while touring the South in order to see Jacobs and her work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;181\u2013183.</ref> On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;162, cf. p.&nbsp;167.</ref>\n\n==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]], depicting the President disbanding the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].]]\n[[File:Visit of the Ku-Klux 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Terror by the Ku-Klux-Klan, engraving published in [[Harper's Weekly]], February 1872]]\nMother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves,<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;186.</ref> they followed the call of the ''New England Freedmen's Aid Society'' for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They arrived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013194.</ref>\n\nBut the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor [[Andrew Johnson]] was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by the former masters with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs's reports from Georgia.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nAlready in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she untertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the [[Ku-Klux-Klan]] and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the ''New York Friends''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;224-225.</ref>\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HarrietJacobsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Harriet Jacobs]]\nAfter her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she kept a [[boarding house]] together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby [[Harvard University]]. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, \"Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord\". (Cf. [[Epistle to the Romans]], 12:11-12)<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013261.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nPrior to [[Jean Fagan Yellin]]'s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as [[John Blassingame]], was that ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' was a fictional novel written by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the [[Amy Post]] papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of ''Incidents,'' and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

(Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), p.&nbsp;xxiii.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled ''The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

The codicil was not signed by Margaret Horniblow.</ref> Mary Matilda's father, the physician Dr. James Norcom (son-in-law of the deceased tavern keeper), became her ''de facto'' master. Her brother John and most of her other property was inherited by the tavern keeper's widow. Dr. Norcom hired John, so that the Jacobs siblings lived together in his household.\nFollowing the death of the widow, her slaves were sold at the New Year's Day auction, 1828. Among them were Harriet's brother John, her grandmother Molly Horniblow and Molly's son Mark. Being sold at public auction was a traumatic experience for twelve-year old John.<ref>{{citation|title=A True Tale of Slavery|at=p.&nbsp;86|language=en|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/jjacobs/jjacobs.html#p86|access-date=November 29, 2019\n}}</ref> Friends of hers bought Molly Horniblow and Mark with money Molly had been working hard to save over the many years of her servitude at the tavern.

He was caught, paraded in chains through Edenton, put into jail, and finally sold to New Orleans. The family later learned that he escaped and reached New York. After that he was lost to the family. The Jacobs siblings who even as children were talking about escaping to freedom, saw him as a hero. Both of them would later name their son for him.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.''

A white woman, who was a slaveholder herself, hid her at great personal risk in her house.

However, the trader was secretly in league with Sawyer, to whom he sold all three of them, thus frustrating Norcom's plan on revenge.

After Sawyer married in 1838, Jacobs asked her grandmother to remind him of his promise. He asked and obtained Jacobs's approval to send their daughter to live with his cousin in Brooklyn, New York, where slavery had already been abolished. He also suggested to send their son to the Free States.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

New York 2004, p.&nbsp;146.</ref>\n\n=== Escape and freedom ===\nIn 1842, Jacobs finally got a chance to escape by boat to [[Philadelphia]], where she was aided by anti-slavery activists of the [[Philadelphia Vigilant Committee]].<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;66.</ref> After a short stay, she continued to [[New York City]]. Although she had no references, Mary Stace Willis, the wife of the then extremely popular author [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], accepted to hire Jacobs as the nanny of her baby daughter Imogen. The two women agreed on a trial period of one week, not suspecting that the relationship between the two families would last into the next generation, until the death of Louisa Matilda Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell, the daughter of Nathaniel Willis and his second wife, in 1917.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;70, 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston-view-1841-Havell.jpeg|251x251px|thumb|left|Boston in 1841]]\nIn 1843 Jacobs heard that Norcom was on his way to New York to force her back into slavery, which was legal for him to do everywhere inside the United States. She asked Mary Willis for a leave of two weeks and went to her brother John in [[Boston]]. John Jacobs, in his capacity as personal servant, had accompanied his owner Sawyer on his marriage trip through the North in 1838. He had gained his freedom by leaving his master in New York. After that he had gone [[whaling]] and had been absent for more than three years. From Boston, Harriet Jacobs wrote to her grandmother asking her to send Joseph there, so that he could live there with his uncle John. After Joseph's arrival, she returned to her work as Imogen Willis's nanny.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;72.</ref>\nHer work with the Willis family came to an abrupt end in October 1843, when Jacobs learned that her whereabouts had been betrayed to Norcom. Again, she had to flee to Boston, which where the strength of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] guaranteed a certain level of security.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;74.</ref> Moving to Boston also gave her the opportunity to take her daughter Louisa Matilda from the house of Sawyer's cousin in Brooklyn, where she had been treated not much better than a slave.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;68-69, 74.</ref>\n\nIn Boston Jacobs took on odd jobs.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;77-78, 87.</ref> Her stay there was interrupted by the death of Mary Stace Willis in March 1845. Nathaniel Willis took his daughter Imogen on a ten-month visit to the family of his deceased wife in England. For the journey, Jacobs resumed her job as nanny. In her autobiography, she reflects on the experiences made during the journey: She didn't notice any sign of racism, which often embittered her life in the USA. In consequence of this, she gained a new access to her Christian faith. At home, Christian ministers treating blacks with contempt or even buying and selling slaves had been an obstacle to her spiritual life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;83\u201387.</ref>\n\n=== The autobiography ===\n''This section is about the genesis of Jacobs's autobiography, seen as part of the story of her life. For the content and an analysis of the autobiography, see the article [[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.\n\n==== Background: Abolitionism and early feminism ====\n\n[[File:William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, journalist, and editor of The Liberator LCCN2017660623 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|William Lloyd Garrison]]\nJohn S. Jacobs got more and more involved with abolitionism, i.&nbsp;e. the anti-slavery movement led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. He undertook several lecture tours, either alone or with fellow abolistionists, among them [[Frederick Douglass]], three years his junior.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;98.</ref> In 1849, John S. Jacobs took responsibility for the ''Anti-Slavery Office and Reading Room'' in [[Rochester, New York]]. His sister Harriet supported him, having been relieved of the daily care for her children (Joseph had left the Boston print shop where his mother had apprenticed him after suffering from racist abuse and had gone on a whaling voyage while his mother had been in England, and Louisa had been sent to a boarding school).<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;102-103.</ref>\n\nThe former \u201eslave girl\u201c who had never been to school, and whose life had mostly been confined by the struggle for her own survival in dignity and that of her children, now found herself in circles that were about to change America through their - by the standards of the time - radical set of ideas. The ''Reading Room'' was in the same building as the newspaper ''[[The North Star (anti-slavery newspaper)|The North Star]]'', run by Frederick Douglass, who today is considered the most influential African American of his century. Jacobs lived at the house of the white couple [[Amy and Isaac Post]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rrlc.org/winningthevote/biographies/amy-post/ |title=Amy Post |publisher=Rochester Regional Library Council |accessdate=December 6, 2019}}</ref> Douglass and the Posts were staunch enimies of slavery and racism, and supporters of [[women's suffrage]]. The year before, Douglass and Amy Post had attended the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the world's first convention on women's rights, and had signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]], which demanded equal rights for women.\n\n==== Obtaining legal freedom ====\n\nIn 1850, Jacobs paid a visit to Nathaniel Parker Willis in New York, wanting to see the now eight-years old Imogen again. Willis's second wife, Cornelia Grinnell Willis, who had not recovered well after the birth of her second child, prevailed upon Jacobs once again to become the nanny of the Willis children. Knowing that this involved a considerable risk for Jacobs, especially since the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] had made it much easier for slaveholders to reclaim their fugitive \"chattels\", she gave her word to John S. Jacobs that she would not let his sister fall into the hands of her persecutors.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;108\u2013110.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1851, Jacobs was again informed that she was in danger of being recaptured. Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs together with her (Willis's) one-year old daughter Lilian to Massachusetts which was comparatively safe. Jacobs, in whose autobiography the constant danger for herself and other slave mothers of being separated from their children is an important theme, spoke to her employer of the sacrifice that letting go of her baby daughter meant to her. Cornelia Willis answered by explaining that the slave catchers would have to return the baby to the mother, if Jacobs should be caught. She would then try to rescue Jacobs.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. Written by Herself |date= |pages=291 |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/jacobs.html#jac291 |access-date=September 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1852, Jacobs read in the newspaper that her legal owner, the daughter of the recently deceased Dr. Norcom, had arrived at a New York Hotel together with her husband, obviously intending to re-claim their fugitive slave. Again, Cornelia Willis sent Jacobs to Massachusetts together with Lilian. Some days later, she wrote a letter to Jacobs informing her of her intention to buy Jacobs's freedom. Jacobs replied that she preferred to join her brother who had gone to California. Regardless, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300. In her autobiography, Jacobs describes her mixed feelings: Bitterness at the thought that \"a human being [was] ''sold'' in the free city of New York\", happiness at the thought that her freedom was secured, and \"love\" and \"gratitude\" for Cornelia Willis.<ref>{{citation|title=Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Soon, she developed enough trust in Amy Post to be able to tell her her story which she had kept secret for so long. Post later described how difficult it was for Jacobs to tell of her traumatic experiences: \"Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her trials to me. ... The burden of these memories lay heavily on her spirit\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;104.</ref>\n\nIn late 1852 or early 1853, Amy Post suggested that Jacobs should write her life story. Jacobs's brother had for some time been urging her to do so, and she felt a moral obligation to tell her story to help build public support for the antislavery cause and thus save others from suffering a similar fate.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\nStill, Jacobs had acted against moral ideas commonly shared in her time, shared including by herself, by consenting to a sexual relationship with Sawyer. The shame caused by this memory and the resulting fear of having to tell her story had been the reason for her initially avoiding contact with the abolitionist movement her brother John had joined in the 1840s.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> Finally, Jacobs overcame her trauma and feeling of shame, and she consented to publish her story. Her reply to Post describing her internal struggle has survived.<ref>Transcribed in the appendix to Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself. Cambridge 2000, p.&nbsp;253\u2013255. Summarized in Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;118-119.</ref>\n\n==== Writing of the manuscript ====\nAt first, Jacobs didn't feel that she was up to writing a book. She wrote a short outline of her story and asked Amy Post to send it to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], proposing to tell her story to Stowe so that Stowe could transform it into a book. Before Stowe's answer arrived, Jacobs read in the papers that the famous author, whose [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], published in 1852, had become an instant bestseller, was going to England. Jacobs then asked Cornelia Willis to propose to Stowe that Jacobs's daughter Louisa accompany her to England and tell the story during the journey. In reply, Stowe forwarded the story outline to Willis and declined to let Louisa join her, citing the possibility of Louisa being spoiled by too much sympathy shown to her in England. Jacobs felt betrayed because her employer thus came to know about the parentage of her children, which was the cause for Jacobs feeling ashamed. In a letter to Post, she analyzed the racist thinking behind Stowe's remark on Louisa with bitter irony: \"what a pity we poor blacks can[']t have the firmness and stability of character that you white people have.\" In consequence, Jacobs gave up the idea of enlisting Stowe's help.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;119\u2013121; Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself.

Written by [[Julia Tyler]], wife of former president [[John Tyler]], the text claimed that the household slaves were \"well clothed and happy\". Jacobs spent the whole night writing a reply, which she sent to the ''[[New York Tribune]]''. Her letter,<ref>{{citation|title=LETTER FROM A FUGITIVE SLAVE. Slaves Sold under Peculiar Circumstances |date= |language=en |url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support16.html |access-date=December 7, 2019}}</ref> signed \"A Fugitive Slave\", published on June 21, was her first text to be printed. Her biographer, [[Jean Fagan Yellin]], comments, \"When the letter was printed ..., an author was born.\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;122-123.</ref>\n\nIn October 1853, she wrote to Amy Post that she had decided to become the author of her own story. In the same letter, only a few lines earlier, she had informed Post of her grandmother's death.<ref>The date of Molly Horniblow's burial in Edenton was September 4, 1853, Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, note to p.124 on p.306.</ref> Yellin concludes that the \"death of her revered grandmother\" made it possible for Jacobs to \"reveal her troubled sexual history\" which she could never have done \"while her proud, judgmental grandmother lived.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;124\u2013126.</ref>\n\nWhile using the little spare time a children's nurse had to write her story, Jacobs lived with the Willis family at Idlewild, their new country residence. With N.P.Willis being largely forgotten today,<ref>\"... when N.P.Willis is mentioned today it is generally as a footnote to some else's story.\"; Baker, Thomas N. Sentiment and Celebrity: Nathaniel Parker Willis and the Trials of Literary Fame. New York, Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-512073-6}}, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Yellin comments on the irony of the situation: \"Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer's retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children's nurse who would create an American classic there\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;126.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1857 her work was finally nearing completion and she asked Amy Post for a preface. Even in this letter she mentions the shame that made writing her story difficult for herself: \"as much pleasure as it would afford me and as great an honor as I would deem it to have your name associated with my Book \u2013Yet believe me dear friend[,] there are many painful things in it \u2013 that make me shrink from asking the sacrifice from one so good and pure as your self\u2013.\"<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;135.</ref>\n\n==== Searching for a publisher ====\n[[File:John Brown. Meeting the slave-mother and her child on the steps of Charlestown jail on his way to execution LCCN2003674588.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Abolitionist drawing of a scene that probably never happened: John Brown meets a slave mother and her child while being led to execution]]\nIn May 1858, Harriet Jacobs sailed to England, hoping to find a publisher there. She carried good letters of introduction, but wasn't able to get her manuscript into print. The reasons for her failure are not clear. Yellin supposes that her contacts among the British abolitionists feared that the story of her liaison with Sawyer would be too much for Victorian Britain's prudery. Disheartened, Jacobs returned to her work at Idlewild and made no further efforts to publish her book until the fall of 1859.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;136\u2013140.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 1859 the anti-slavery activist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] tried to incite a slave rebellion at [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harper's Ferry]]. Brown, who was executed in December, was considered a martyr and hero by many abolitionists, among them Harriet Jacobs, who added a tribute to Brown as the final chapter to her manuscript. She then sent the manuscript to publishers Phillips and Samson in Boston. They were ready to publish it under the condition that either Nathaniel Parker Willis or Harriet Beecher Stowe would supply a preface. Jacobs was unwilling to ask Willis, who held pro-slavery views, but she asked Stowe, who declined. Soon after, the publishers failed, thus frustrating Jacobs's second attempt to get her story printed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n==== Lydia Maria Child as the book's editor ====\nJacobs now contacted [[Thayer and Eldridge]], who had recently published a sympathizing biography of John Brown.<ref>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown by James Redpath.</ref> Thayer and Eldridge demanded a preface by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. Jacobs confessed to Amy Post, that after suffering another rejection from Stowe, she could hardly bring herself to asking another famous writer, but she \"resolved to make my last effort\".<ref>Jacobs to Post, October 8, 1860, cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;140 and note on p.314.</ref>\n\nJacobs met Child in Boston, and Child not only agreed to write a preface, but also to become the editor of the book. Child then re-arranged the material according to a more chronological order. She also suggested to drop the final chapter on Brown, and to add more information on the anti-black violence which occurred in Edenton after [[Nat Turner|Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion]]. During this work she kept contact with Jacobs via mail, but the two women failed to meet a second time during the editing process, because with Cornelia Willis passing through a dangerous pregnancy and premature birth Jacobs was not able to leave Idlewild.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;140-142.</ref>\n\nAfter the book had been [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotyped]], Thayer and Eldridge, too, failed. Jacobs succeeded in buying the stereotype plates and to get the book printed and bound.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;142-143.</ref>\n\nIn January 1861, nearly four years after she had finished the manuscript, Jacobs's ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' finally appeared before the public. The next month, her brother John S. published his own, much shorter memoir, entitled ''A True Tale of Slavery'', in London. Both siblings relate in their respective narratives their own experiences, experiences made together, and episodes in the life of the other sibling.\n\nIn her book, Harriet Jacobs doesn't mention the town or even the state, where she was held as a slave, and changes all personal names, given names as well as family names, with the only exception of the Post couple, whose names are given correctly. However, John Jacobs (called \"William\" in his sister's book) mentions Edenton as his birth place and uses the correct given names, but abbreviates most family names. So Dr. Norcom is \"Dr. Flint\" in Harriet's book, but \"Dr. N-\" in John's. An author's name is not given on the title page, but the \"Preface by the author\" is signed \"Linda Brent\" and the narrator is called by that name throughout the story.\n\n==== Reception of the book ====\nThe book was promoted via the abolitionist networks and was well received by the critics. Jacobs arranged for a publication in Great Britain, which was published in the first months of 1862, soon followed by a pirated edition.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;151-152.</ref>\n\nThe publication did not cause contempt as Jacobs had feared. On the contrary, Jacobs gained respect. Although she had used a pseudonym, in abolitionist circles she was regularly introduced with words like \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of Linda\", thereby conceding her the honorific \"Mrs.\" which normally was reserved for married women.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> The ''[[The Daily News (UK)|London Daily News]]'' wrote in 1862, that Linda Brent was a true \"heroine\", giving an example \"of endurance and persistency in the struggle for liberty\" and \"moral rectitude\".<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;152.</ref>\n\n=== Civil War and Reconstruction ===\n==== Relief work and politics ====\n[[File:The Old Flag Never Touched the Ground.jpg|thumb|right|Heroicized painting of the famous assault on [[Fort Wagner]] by the 54th Massachusetts, July 1863.]]\n[[File:Slave pen.

Since Lincoln's administration continued to regard them as their masters' property, these refugees were in most cases declared \"contraband of war\" and simply called \"[[Contraband (American Civil War)|Contrabands]]\". Many of them found refuge in makeshift camps, suffering and dying from want of the most basic necessities. Originally, Jacobs had planned to follow the example her brother John S. had set nearly two decades ago and become an abolitionist speaker, but now she saw that helping the ''Contrabands'' would mean rendering her race a service more urgently needed.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;157.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1862, Harriet Jacobs went to [[Washington, D.C.]] and neighboring [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. She summarized her experiences during the first months in a report entitled ''Life among the Contrabands'', published in September in Garrison's ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''. The author was featured as \"Mrs. Jacobs, the author of 'Linda'\". This report is a description of the fugitives' misery designed to appeal to donors, but it is also a political denunciation of slavery. Jacobs emphasizes her conviction that the [[freedman|freedmen]] will be able to build self-determined lives, if they get the necessary support.<ref>{{citation|title=Life among the Contrabands|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support5.html|access-date=December 22, 2019\n}}. Summary of the report in: Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nDuring the fall of 1862, she traveled through the North using her popularity as author of ''Incidents'' to build up a network to support her relief work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;161-162.</ref> The ''New York Friends'' (i.e. the [[Quakers]]) gave her credentials as a relief agent.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;164.</ref>\n\nFrom January 1863, she made Alexandria the center of her activity. Together with Quaker [[Julia Wilbur]], the teacher, feminist and abolitionist, whom she had already known in Rochester, she was distributing clothes and blankets and at the same time struggling with incompetent, corrupt, or openly racist authorities.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;164\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile doing relief work in Alexandria, Jacobs was also involved in the political world. In May 1863 she attended the yearly conference of the New England Anti-Slavery Society in Boston. Together with the other participants she watched the parade of the newly created [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]],<ref>For the symbolic and political value of this regiment cf. David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, pp.&nbsp;388\u2013402, especially p.&nbsp;398.</ref> consisting of black soldiers led by white officers. Since the Lincoln administration had declined to use African American soldiers only a few months past, this was a highly symbolic event. Jacobs expressed her joy and pride in a letter to Lydia Maria Child: \"How my heart swelled with the thought that my poor oppressed race were to strike a blow for freedom !\" <ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;168\u2013169.</ref>\n\n==== The Jacobs School ====\n[[File:Jacobs School 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Harriet and Louisa Matilda Jacobs and their students in front of the Jacobs School, Alexandria, Virginia, 1864]]\nIn most slave states, teaching slaves to read and write had been forbidden. Virginia had even prohibited teaching these skills to free blacks. After Union troops occupied Alexandria in 1861, some schools for blacks emerged, but there was not a single free school under African American control. Jacobs supported a project conceived by the black community in 1863 to found a new school. In the fall of 1863 her daughter Louisa Matilda who had been trained as a teacher, came to Alexandria in the company of Virginia Lawton, a black friend of the Jacobs family. After some struggle with white missionaries from the North who wanted to take control of the school, the ''Jacobs School'' opened in January 1864 under Louisa Matilda's leadership. In the ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', Harriet Jacobs explained that it was not disapproval of white teachers that made her fight for the school being controlled by the black community. But she wanted to help the former slaves, who had been raised \"to look upon the white race as their natural superiors and masters\", to develop \"respect for their race\".<ref>H.Jacobs to L.M.Child, published in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', entitled {{citation|title=Letter from Teachers of the Freedmen|date=April 16, 1864|language=en|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/jacobs/support4.html|access-date=December 31, 2019\n}}; cf. Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;177. For the context, pp.&nbsp;176-178.</ref>\n\nJacobs's work in Alexandria was recognized on the local as well as on the national level, especially in abolitionist circles. In the spring of 1864 she was elected to the executive committee of the ''[[Women's Loyal National League]]'', a women's organization founded in 1863 in response to an appeal by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which aimed at collecting signatures for a [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] to abolish slavery.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;175\u2013176.</ref> On August 1, 1864 she delivered the speech on occasion of the celebration of the [[Emancipation of the British West Indies|British West Indian Emancipation]]<ref>A celebration introduced by the abolitionists in order to demonstrate the backwardness of the US in comparison with the British colonies.</ref> in front of the African American soldiers of a military hospital in Alexandria. Many abolitionists, among them Frederick Douglass,<ref>David W. Blight, Frederick Douglass. Prophet of Freedom. New York 2018, p.&nbsp;418. This is the only time Jacobs is mentioned in this book, while Douglass is mentioned on 30 different pages in Yellin, Harriet Jacobs (according to the index).</ref> stopped over in Alexandria while touring the South in order to see Jacobs and her work.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;181\u2013183.</ref> On a personal level, she found her labors highly rewarding. Already in December 1862 she had written to Amy Post that the preceding six months had been the happiest in her whole life.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;162, cf. p.&nbsp;167.</ref>\n\n==== Relief work with freedmen in Savannah ====\n[[File:Nast on Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Cartoon of [[Andrew Johnson]], depicting the President disbanding the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].]]\n[[File:Visit of the Ku-Klux 1872.jpg|thumb|right|Terror by the Ku-Klux-Klan, engraving published in [[Harper's Weekly]], February 1872]]\nMother and daughter Jacobs continued their relief work in Alexandria until after the victory of the Union. Convinced that the freedmen in Alexandria were able to care for themselves,<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, p.&nbsp;186.</ref> they followed the call of the ''New England Freedmen's Aid Society'' for teachers to help instruct the freedmen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They arrived in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in November 1865, only 11 months after the slaves there had been freed by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. During the following months they distributed clothes, opened a school and were planning to start an orphanage and an asylum for old people.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;190\u2013194.</ref>\n\nBut the political situation had changed: Lincoln had been assassinated and his successor [[Andrew Johnson]] was a Southerner and former slaveholder. He ordered the removal of many freedmen from the land which had been allotted to them by the army just one year before. The land question together with the unjust labor contracts forced on the former slaves by the former masters with the help of the army, are an important subject in Jacobs's reports from Georgia.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;191\u2013195.</ref>\n\nAlready in July 1866, mother and daughter Jacobs left Savannah which was more and more suffering from anti-black violence. Once again, Harriet Jacobs went to Idlewild, to assist Cornelia Willis in caring for her dying husband until his death in January 1867.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1867, she visited the widow of her uncle Mark who was the only survivor of the family still living in Edenton. At the end of the year she untertook her last journey to Great Britain in order to collect money for the projected orphanage and asylum in Savannah. But after her return she had to realize that the anti-black terror in Georgia by the [[Ku-Klux-Klan]] and other groups rendered these projects impossible. The money collected was given to the asylum fund of the ''New York Friends''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;210-211, 217 and note on p.&nbsp;345.</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s a personal tragedy occurred: In the early 1850s, her son Joseph had gone to California to [[California Gold Rush|search for gold]] together with his uncle John. Later the two had continued on to Australia. John S. Jacobs later went to England, while Joseph stayed in Australia. Some time later, no more letters reached Jacobs from Australia. Using her connections to Australian clergymen, Child had an appeal on behalf of her friend read in Australian churches, but to no avail. Jacobs never again heard of her son.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;224-225.</ref>\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HarrietJacobsGrave.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Harriet Jacobs]]\nAfter her return from England, Jacobs retired to private life. In [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], she kept a [[boarding house]] together with her daughter. Among her boarders were faculty members of nearby [[Harvard University]]. In 1873, her brother John S. returned to the U.S. together with his English wife, their son Joseph and two stepchildren to live close to his sister in Cambridge. He died in December of the same year, 1873. In 1877 Harriet and Louisa Jacobs moved to Washington, D.C., where Louisa hoped to get work as a teacher. However, she found work only for short periods. Mother and daughter again took to keeping a boarding house, until in 1887/88 Harriet Jacobs became too sick to continue with the boarding house. Mother and daughter took on odd jobs and were supported by friends, among them Cornelia Willis. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7, 1897 in Washington, D.C., and was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge next to her brother. Her tombstone reads, \"Patient in tribulation, fervent in spirit serving the Lord\". (Cf. [[Epistle to the Romans]], 12:11-12)<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin: ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life.'' New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;217\u2013261.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nPrior to [[Jean Fagan Yellin]]'s research in the 1980s, the accepted academic opinion, voiced by such historians as [[John Blassingame]], was that ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' was a fictional novel written by [[Lydia Maria Child]]. However, Yellin found and used a variety of historical documents, including from the [[Amy Post]] papers at the University of Rochester, state and local historical societies, and the Horniblow and Norcom papers at the North Carolina state archives, to establish both that Harriet Jacobs was the true author of ''Incidents,'' and that the narrative was her autobiography, not a work of fiction. Her edition of ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' was published in 1987 with the endorsement of Professor John Blassingame.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life. New York 2004, pp.&nbsp;xv-xx; Yellin, Jean Fagan and others, eds., The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers, 2 vols. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), p.&nbsp;xxiii.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Yellin published an exhaustive biography (394 pages) entitled ''Harriet Jacobs: A Life''. Yellin also conceived of the idea of the Harriet Jacobs Papers Project. In 2000, an advisory board for the project was established, and after funding was awarded, the project began on a full-time basis in September 2002. Of the approximately 900 documents by, to, and about Harriet Jacobs, her brother John S. Jacobs, and her daughter Louisa Matilda Jacobs amassed by the Project, over 300 were published in 2008 in a two volume edition entitled ''The Harriet Jacobs Family Papers''.<ref>Jean Fagan Yellin, Harriet Jacobs: A Life.

Reynolds]] states that ''Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl'' \"and ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave'' are commonly viewed as the two most important slave narratives.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/books/to-be-a-slave.html| title=To Be a Slave| work=the New York Times| author= David S.
