The range is a [[massif]] stretching 60&nbsp;km from north to south and 30&nbsp;km from east to west. It is one of the snowiest places in Japan and snowpacks stay in summer. The mountains feature deep canyons with alpine plants on their ridges and pristine Japanese beech forests on their lower slopes.\n\nThe source of the Sagae River, famous for its clear water, is located in the Yamagata Prefecture side.

Prior to its construction, the negotiation over the relocation issue between the government and residents derailed, and it took 19 years from the initial planning to the start of its operation. The Gassan Reservoir covers 340 ha of area and has a large population of [[ayu]], [[rainbow trout]], [[salvelinus]], and [[Masu salmon|seema]].

The original house was built in 1796 and featured six bays and three dormers on the roof. In the mid-1850s, the one-and-a-half-story house was extended south, almost doubling its size, and increased to nine bays including a new double door entrance. The entry doors are surrounded with a transom and sidelights, showcasing original hand-painted stained glass, etched and patterned after the French cross to allegedly ward off evil. The main feature of the Myrtles is the 125-foot-long veranda that extends the entire length of the fa\u00e7ade, and wraps around the southern end of the house. The ornamental cast-iron railing, with an elaborate grape-cluster design, supports a broad Doric [[entablature]], and on the gabled roof, with six brick chimneys, are two large double-paned, pedimented dormers with Doric style pilasters, interspersed with three single-paned dormers. When the original roof of the house was extended to encompass the new addition, the existing dormers were copied to maintain a smooth line. The west facing rear fa\u00e7ade features a central, open loggia that is enclosed on three sides by the house, and on the roof are five pedimented dormers identical to the front.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/louisiana/myr.htm|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=National Park Service|date=|accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Interior===\nThe Myrtles has 22 rooms spread over two floors. The spacious entry hall runs the length of the house and features faux-bois, open pierced friezework molding, a French [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandelier weighing more than 300 pounds and a cantilevered staircase. The flooring and most of the windows in the house are original. To the left of the hall is the music room that is adjacent to the only bedroom found on the first floor. The principal rooms of the house are found to the right of the hall. The walls of the original house were removed and repositioned to create four large rooms that were used as identical ladies and gentlemen's parlors, a formal dining room and a game room. The two parlors feature [[Carrara marble]] mantles in the [[Rococo Revival]]-style on the north and south walls, and are crowned with elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, made from a mixture of clay, [[Spanish moss]] and cattle hair, with no two being the same.<ref name=\"Myrtles\">{{cite web|url=http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=Myrtles Plantation|date=|accessdate=22 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406221354/http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe second floor features five bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The largest bedroom, known as the Judge Clarke Woodruff Suite, is the only room that is accessed by the main staircase in the entry hall. The remaining four bedrooms, that are separated by a common sitting room, are accessed by a staircase that ascends from the rear loggia. The floor of these bedrooms were raised one foot when the house was renovated, as the addition had higher ceilings than the original house.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe current plantation landscape is centered on a large pond that features a small island centered with a gazebo accessed by a bridge. To the rear of the main house is the oldest structure on the grounds. Now known as the General's Store, this was where General Bradford lived while the main house was being built. Currently it is used as the gift shop, laundry facilities, plantation offices and guest breakfast spot.<ref name=\"Advocate\">{{cite news|title=\u2018Haunted\u2019 Myrtles Plantation gets scare from gift shop fire|newspaper=The Advocate|date=7 August 2014 |url=http://theadvocate.com/news/9929294-123/haunted-myrtles-plantation-gets-scare|accessdate=22 April 2016| location=|first=Amy|last=Wold}}</ref> To the south is another structure that houses a restaurant.

The original house was built in 1796 and featured six bays and three dormers on the roof. In the mid-1850s, the one-and-a-half-story house was extended south, almost doubling its size, and increased to nine bays including a new double door entrance. The entry doors are surrounded with a transom and sidelights, showcasing original hand-painted stained glass, etched and patterned after the French cross to allegedly ward off evil. The main feature of the Myrtles is the 125-foot-long veranda that extends the entire length of the fa\u00e7ade, and wraps around the southern end of the house. The ornamental cast-iron railing, with an elaborate grape-cluster design, supports a broad Doric [[entablature]], and on the gabled roof, with six brick chimneys, are two large double-paned, pedimented dormers with Doric style pilasters, interspersed with three single-paned dormers. When the original roof of the house was extended to encompass the new addition, the existing dormers were copied to maintain a smooth line. The west facing rear fa\u00e7ade features a central, open loggia that is enclosed on three sides by the house, and on the roof are five pedimented dormers identical to the front.<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/louisiana/myr.htm|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=National Park Service|date=|accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Interior===\nThe Myrtles has 22 rooms spread over two floors. The spacious entry hall runs the length of the house and features faux-bois, open pierced friezework molding, a French [[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat crystal]] chandelier weighing more than 300 pounds and a cantilevered staircase. The flooring and most of the windows in the house are original. To the left of the hall is the music room that is adjacent to the only bedroom found on the first floor. The principal rooms of the house are found to the right of the hall. The walls of the original house were removed and repositioned to create four large rooms that were used as identical ladies and gentlemen's parlors, a formal dining room and a game room. The two parlors feature [[Carrara marble]] mantles in the [[Rococo Revival]]-style on the north and south walls, and are crowned with elaborate plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, made from a mixture of clay, [[Spanish moss]] and cattle hair, with no two being the same.<ref name=\"Myrtles\">{{cite web|url=http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|title=Myrtles Plantation|publisher=Myrtles Plantation|date=|accessdate=22 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406221354/http://myrtlesplantation.com/history.php|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe second floor features five bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. The largest bedroom, known as the Judge Clarke Woodruff Suite, is the only room that is accessed by the main staircase in the entry hall. The remaining four bedrooms, that are separated by a common sitting room, are accessed by a staircase that ascends from the rear loggia. The floor of these bedrooms were raised one foot when the house was renovated, as the addition had higher ceilings than the original house.\n\n===Grounds===\nThe current plantation landscape is centered on a large pond that features a small island centered with a gazebo accessed by a bridge. To the rear of the main house is the oldest structure on the grounds. Now known as the General's Store, this was where General Bradford lived while the main house was being built. Currently it is used as the gift shop, laundry facilities, plantation offices and guest breakfast spot.<ref name=\"Advocate\">{{cite news|title=\u2018Haunted\u2019 Myrtles Plantation gets scare from gift shop fire|newspaper=The Advocate|date=7 August 2014 |url=http://theadvocate.com/news/9929294-123/haunted-myrtles-plantation-gets-scare|accessdate=22 April 2016| location=|first=Amy|last=Wold}}</ref> To the south is another structure that houses a restaurant.
