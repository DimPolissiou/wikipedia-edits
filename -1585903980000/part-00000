{"title_page": "Higher alkanes", "text_new": "'''Higher alkanes''' are [[alkane]]s having nine or more [[carbon]] atoms. [[Nonane]] is the lightest alkane to have a [[flash point]] above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, and is not classified as dangerously [[Flammable liquid|flammable]].\n\nThe term ''higher alkanes'' is sometimes used literally as \"alkanes with a higher number of carbon atoms\". One definition distinguishes the higher alkanes as the n-alkanes that are solid under natural conditions.{{who|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Uses ==\nAlkanes from [[nonane]] to [[hexadecane]] (those alkanes with nine to sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], which are less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterised by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an older name for hexadecane. However the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], where the fuel becomes too [[Viscosity|thick]] to flow correctly.  Mixtures of the normal alkanes are used as [[boiling point]] standards for simulated [[distillation]] by [[gas chromatography]].<ref>ASTM D5399-09, Standard Test Method for Boiling Point Distribution of Hydrocarbon Solvents by Gas Chromatography</ref>\n\nAlkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricant|lubricating oil]]. In latter function they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their [[hydrophobic]] nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], used for [[lubrication]], [[electrical insulation]], and [[candle]]s. Paraffin wax should not be confused with [[beeswax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.\n\nAlkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]] (asphalt), used (for example) in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]].\n\n== Names ==\n\nSome alkanes have non-IUPAC trivial names: \n* cetane, for [[hexadecane]]\n* cerane, for [[hexacosane]]<ref>Donald Mackay, ''Handbook of Physical-Chemical Properties and Environmental Fate for Organic Chemicals'', {{isbn|1420044397}}, p. 206</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe properties listed here refer to the straight-chain alkanes (or: ''n-alkanes'').\n\n=== Nonane to hexadecane ===\n\nThis group of n-alkanes is generally liquid under standard conditions.<ref>Karl Griesbaum, Arno Behr, Dieter Biedenkapp, Heinz-Werner Voges, Dorothea Garbe, Christian Paetz, Gerd Collin, Dieter Mayer Hartmut H\u00f6ke \"Hydrocarbons\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a13_227}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float: center; clear: center; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n!

[[Nonane]] is the lightest alkane to have a [[flash point]] above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, and is not classified as dangerously [[Flammable liquid|flammable]].\n\nThe term ''higher alkanes'' is sometimes used literally as \"alkanes with a higher number of carbon atoms\". One definition distinguishes the higher alkanes as the n-alkanes that are solid under natural conditions.{{who|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Uses ==\nAlkanes from [[nonane]] to [[hexadecane]] (those alkanes with nine to sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], which are less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterised by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an older name for hexadecane. However the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]], where the fuel becomes too [[Viscosity|thick]] to flow correctly.  Mixtures of the normal alkanes are used as [[boiling point]] standards for simulated [[distillation]] by [[gas chromatography]].<ref>ASTM D5399-09, Standard Test Method for Boiling Point Distribution of Hydrocarbon Solvents by Gas Chromatography</ref>\n\nAlkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricant|lubricating oil]]. In latter function they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their [[hydrophobic]] nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], used for [[lubrication]], [[electrical insulation]], and [[candle]]s. Paraffin wax should not be confused with [[beeswax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.\n\nAlkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]] (asphalt), used (for example) in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]].\n\n== Names ==\n\nSome alkanes have non-IUPAC trivial names: \n* cetane, for [[hexadecane]]\n* cerane, for [[hexacosane]]<ref>Donald Mackay, ''Handbook of Physical-Chemical Properties and Environmental Fate for Organic Chemicals'', {{isbn|1420044397}}, p. 206</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe properties listed here refer to the straight-chain alkanes (or: ''n-alkanes'').\n\n=== Nonane to hexadecane ===\n\nThis group of n-alkanes is generally liquid under standard conditions.<ref>Karl Griesbaum, Arno Behr, Dieter Biedenkapp, Heinz-Werner Voges, Dorothea Garbe, Christian Paetz, Gerd Collin, Dieter Mayer Hartmut H\u00f6ke \"Hydrocarbons\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a13_227}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float: center; clear: center; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n!

The line runs in an orbital north to south route following the alignment of the [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Although it has the characteristics of [[light rail]], such as with the type of [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] used, it is more akin to a [[rapid transit]] system owing to its total [[grade separation]] and high passenger throughput.\n\nEnvisioned in the 1970s as part of the Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan, the thirteen-station, {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp = us|adj = on}} line was the second rapid transit line to be built in Metro Manila when it started full operations in 2000 under a 25-year concession agreement between its private owners and the Philippine government's [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] (DOTr).\n\nThe line is owned by the [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] (MRTC), a private company operating in partnership with the DOTr under a [[Build-Operate-Transfer|Build-Lease-Transfer]] agreement.\nServing close to 550,000 passengers on a daily basis when MRTC's maintenance provider, [[Sumitomo Corporation|Sumitomo Corp.]] of Japan, was handling the maintenance of the system, the line is the busiest among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, built with essential standards such as [[barrier-free|barrier-free access]] and the use of contact-less card tickets to better facilitate passenger access. Total ridership significantly exceeds its built maximum capacity of 350,000 passengers a day, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to alleviate chronic congestion in addition to the procurement of new rolling stock.\n\nSince 2006, the system's private owners had been offering various capacity expansion proposals to the DOTC. In 2014, after the DOTC's handling of the line's maintenance for two years amid questions about the line's structural integrity owing to the poor maintenance and the pronouncements that the system, in general, was safe, experts from [[MTR|MTR HK]] were commissioned to review the system. MTR HK made the opinion that the rail system was compromised due to the DOTC's poor maintenance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeam.com/2016/01/31/on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-the-mrt/|title=On a clear day you can see the MRT|last=Salazar|first=Irineo B.

Although the line is aimed at reducing traffic congestion and travel time along EDSA, the transportation system has only been partially successful due to the DOTC's inaction on the private sector's proposals to expand the capacity of the system to take up to 1.1 million passengers a day. Expanding the network's capacity to accommodate the rising number of passengers is currently set on tackling this problem.\n\n==Route==\n[[Image:MRT-3 Manila train towards Ayala Station.jpg|thumb|A Class 3000 train approaching [[Ayala station]].]]\nThe line serves 13 stations on {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp=us}} of line,<ref name=\"stations\">{{cite web|url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |title=About Us \u2013 MRT3 Stations |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122003116/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |archivedate=January 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"line\">{{cite web |url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |title=About Us \u2013 Background |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508151958/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref> spaced on average around {{convert|1300|m|ft}} apart.<ref name=\"y2k\" />  The rails are mostly elevated and erected either over or along the roads covered, with sections below ground before and after [[Buendia station|Buendia]] and [[Ayala station|Ayala]] stations, the only underground stations on the line. The southern terminus of the line is the [[Taft Avenue station]] at the intersection between [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] and [[Taft Avenue]], while the northern terminus is the [[North Avenue station (Line 3)|North Avenue station]] along [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa, [[Quezon City]].  The rail line serves the cities that [[Circumferential Road 4]] ([[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]]) passes through: [[Pasay]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Quezon City]]. The line crosses [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) at [[Magallanes Interchange]] in Makati.\n\nThree stations currently serve as interchanges between the lines operated by the MRTC, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] (LRTA), and [[Philippine National Railways]] (PNR). [[Magallanes station]] is near the PNR's [[EDSA railway station|EDSA station]], while [[Araneta Center-Cubao station (Line 3)|Araneta Center-Cubao]] Station is connected by a covered walkway to its [[Araneta Center\u2013Cubao station (Line 2)|namesake]] station of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]], and [[Taft Avenue station]] is connected via a covered walkway to the [[EDSA station (Line 1)|EDSA station]] of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]]. No stations are connected to other rapid transit lines within the paid areas, though that is set to change with the connection of Line 1 to, the subsequent opening and connection of [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] to and the construction of a new concourse for [[North Avenue Grand Central station|North Avenue station]] which accommodates interchange within the paid area.\n\nEarly on during the construction of the line, a plan was drafted for a spur line towards the [[Makati Central Business District]], built between Ayala and Buendia stations. This was subsequently abandoned and rail tracks never laid down. The remaining evidence of this abandoned plan is an underground viaduct between Buendia and Ayala station turning right.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"2\" | Distance (km)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Transfers\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n|-\n!

The expansion has been shelved by then President [[Gloria Arroyo]] in favor of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Line 1]]'s extension from [[Monumento station|Monumento]] to a new [[North Avenue Grand Central station|common station]] that it will share with at North Avenue, thus closing the loop.  However, this move of President Arroyo to take away Phase 2 had proven to be ill-advised as the ridership is very low at only about 30,000 passengers a day. The southern terminus of the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] (originally Line 4 along Quezon Avenue., but had since changed route several times), which will link [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan|Caloocan (north)]], and [[San Jose del Monte|San Jose del Monte City]], [[Bulacan]] will be sharing the same station.\n\nThe [[National Economic and Development Authority (Philippines)|National Economic and Development Authority]] as well as then President Arroyo herself have said that the link at North Avenue is a national priority, since it would not only provide seamless service between the Lines 1 and 3, but would also help decongest Metro Manila.<ref name=\"neda\">{{Cite news | author=Torres, Ted P. | title=LRT-MRT link is nat'l priority \u2013 NEDA | url=http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=September 21, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040925141346/http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | archivedate=September 25, 2004 }}</ref>  It is estimated that by 2010, when the extension is completed, some 684,000 commuters would use the line every day from the present 400,000, and traffic congestion on EDSA would be cut by as much as 50%.<ref name=\"commuters\">{{cite press release | title=After gov't takeover of NAIA Terminal 3, PGMA orders immediate completion of EDSA MRT3 extension | publisher=[[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] | date=January 4, 2005 | url=http://www.dotc.gov.ph/actioncenter/articles/2005_jan/articles_010405.htm | accessdate=May 19, 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nProposals to fully unite Lines 1 and 3 operations, trains and systems have been pitched but has not been pursued so far. Feasibility tests for this proposition included Line 1 trains visiting Line 3 depot facilities and running them on the entire line. It has since been shelved for undisclosed reasons, but may be a possibility should Manny Pangilinan's Metro Pacific attempts to purchase the entire system succeed. If and when this happens, the system may be theoretically controlled or connected to Line 1's current operating concessionaire, LRMC (Light Rail Manila Consortium), of whom Pangilinan has a controlling stake, paving the way to a possible line merger.\n\n====Transfer of operations from MRTC to LRTA====\nRecently, a new study for the Metro Manila Rail Network has been unveiled by DOTC Undersecretary for Public Information Dante Velasco that Lines 1, 2, and 3 will be under one management, the [[Light Rail Transit Authority]]. This is due to maintenance cost issues for Line 1's maintenance cost, which is approximately \u20b135 million, along with Line 2's \u20b125 million and Line 3's \u20b154 million maintenance costs. Another reason for this study is for the unification of the lines. According to DOTC Undersecretary for Rails Glicerio Sicat, the transfer was set by the government in June 2011.<ref name=\"operations\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/business-columns/36361-govt-creates-team-for-mrt-3-due-diligence-sets-june-takeover|title=Govt creates team for MRT-3 due diligence, sets June takeover|author=Amojelar, Darwin G.|date=December 28, 2010|work=[[The Manila Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011|publisher=Manila Times Publishing Corporation}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  However, it is unlikely that the private owners, MRTC, will approve this plan.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] Chief Rafael S.

The line runs in an orbital north to south route following the alignment of the [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Although it has the characteristics of [[light rail]], such as with the type of [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] used, it is more akin to a [[rapid transit]] system owing to its total [[grade separation]] and high passenger throughput.\n\nEnvisioned in the 1970s as part of the Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan, the thirteen-station, {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp = us|adj = on}} line was the second rapid transit line to be built in Metro Manila when it started full operations in 2000 under a 25-year concession agreement between its private owners and the Philippine government's [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] (DOTr).\n\nThe line is owned by the [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] (MRTC), a private company operating in partnership with the DOTr under a [[Build-Operate-Transfer|Build-Lease-Transfer]] agreement.\nServing close to 550,000 passengers on a daily basis when MRTC's maintenance provider, [[Sumitomo Corporation|Sumitomo Corp.]] of Japan, was handling the maintenance of the system, the line is the busiest among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, built with essential standards such as [[barrier-free|barrier-free access]] and the use of contact-less card tickets to better facilitate passenger access. Total ridership significantly exceeds its built maximum capacity of 350,000 passengers a day, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to alleviate chronic congestion in addition to the procurement of new rolling stock.\n\nSince 2006, the system's private owners had been offering various capacity expansion proposals to the DOTC. In 2014, after the DOTC's handling of the line's maintenance for two years amid questions about the line's structural integrity owing to the poor maintenance and the pronouncements that the system, in general, was safe, experts from [[MTR|MTR HK]] were commissioned to review the system. MTR HK made the opinion that the rail system was compromised due to the DOTC's poor maintenance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeam.com/2016/01/31/on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-the-mrt/|title=On a clear day you can see the MRT|last=Salazar|first=Irineo B.

Although the line is aimed at reducing traffic congestion and travel time along EDSA, the transportation system has only been partially successful due to the DOTC's inaction on the private sector's proposals to expand the capacity of the system to take up to 1.1 million passengers a day. Expanding the network's capacity to accommodate the rising number of passengers is currently set on tackling this problem.\n\n==Route==\n[[Image:MRT-3 Manila train towards Ayala Station.jpg|thumb|A Class 3000 train approaching [[Ayala station]].]]\nThe line serves 13 stations on {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp=us}} of line,<ref name=\"stations\">{{cite web|url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |title=About Us \u2013 MRT3 Stations |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122003116/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |archivedate=January 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"line\">{{cite web |url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |title=About Us \u2013 Background |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508151958/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref> spaced on average around {{convert|1300|m|ft}} apart.<ref name=\"y2k\" />  The rails are mostly elevated and erected either over or along the roads covered, with sections below ground before and after [[Buendia station|Buendia]] and [[Ayala station|Ayala]] stations, the only underground stations on the line. The southern terminus of the line is the [[Taft Avenue station]] at the intersection between [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] and [[Taft Avenue]], while the northern terminus is the [[North Avenue station (Line 3)|North Avenue station]] along [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa, [[Quezon City]].  The rail line serves the cities that [[Circumferential Road 4]] ([[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]]) passes through: [[Pasay]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Quezon City]]. The line crosses [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) at [[Magallanes Interchange]] in Makati.\n\nThree stations currently serve as interchanges between the lines operated by the MRTC, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] (LRTA), and [[Philippine National Railways]] (PNR). [[Magallanes station]] is near the PNR's [[EDSA railway station|EDSA station]], while [[Araneta Center-Cubao station (Line 3)|Araneta Center-Cubao]] Station is connected by a covered walkway to its [[Araneta Center\u2013Cubao station (Line 2)|namesake]] station of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]], and [[Taft Avenue station]] is connected via a covered walkway to the [[EDSA station (Line 1)|EDSA station]] of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]]. No stations are connected to other rapid transit lines within the paid areas, though that is set to change with the connection of Line 1 to, the subsequent opening and connection of [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] to and the construction of a new concourse for [[North Avenue Grand Central station|North Avenue station]] which accommodates interchange within the paid area.\n\nEarly on during the construction of the line, a plan was drafted for a spur line towards the [[Makati Central Business District]], built between Ayala and Buendia stations. This was subsequently abandoned and rail tracks never laid down. The remaining evidence of this abandoned plan is an underground viaduct between Buendia and Ayala station turning right.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"2\" | Distance (km)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Transfers\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n|-\n!

Due to the very high patronage of the line, part of the platform corresponding to the front car of the train is cordoned off for the use of women, children, elderly and disabled passengers.\n\nThe stations are also designed to occupy the entire span of EDSA, allowing passengers to safely cross between one end of the road and the other.<ref name=\"y2k\" />\n\n===Shops and services===\nInside the concourse of all stations are stalls or shops where people can buy food or drinks. Stalls vary by station, and some have fast food stalls.

The expansion has been shelved by then President [[Gloria Arroyo]] in favor of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Line 1]]'s extension from [[Monumento station|Monumento]] to a new [[North Avenue Grand Central station|common station]] that it will share with at North Avenue, thus closing the loop.  However, this move of President Arroyo to take away Phase 2 had proven to be ill-advised as the ridership is very low at only about 30,000 passengers a day. The southern terminus of the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] (originally Line 4 along Quezon Avenue., but had since changed route several times), which will link [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan|Caloocan (north)]], and [[San Jose del Monte|San Jose del Monte City]], [[Bulacan]] will be sharing the same station.\n\nThe [[National Economic and Development Authority (Philippines)|National Economic and Development Authority]] as well as then President Arroyo herself have said that the link at North Avenue is a national priority, since it would not only provide seamless service between the Lines 1 and 3, but would also help decongest Metro Manila.<ref name=\"neda\">{{Cite news | author=Torres, Ted P. | title=LRT-MRT link is nat'l priority \u2013 NEDA | url=http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=September 21, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040925141346/http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | archivedate=September 25, 2004 }}</ref>  It is estimated that by 2010, when the extension is completed, some 684,000 commuters would use the line every day from the present 400,000, and traffic congestion on EDSA would be cut by as much as 50%.<ref name=\"commuters\">{{cite press release | title=After gov't takeover of NAIA Terminal 3, PGMA orders immediate completion of EDSA MRT3 extension | publisher=[[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] | date=January 4, 2005 | url=http://www.dotc.gov.ph/actioncenter/articles/2005_jan/articles_010405.htm | accessdate=May 19, 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nProposals to fully unite Lines 1 and 3 operations, trains and systems have been pitched but has not been pursued so far. Feasibility tests for this proposition included Line 1 trains visiting Line 3 depot facilities and running them on the entire line. It has since been shelved for undisclosed reasons, but may be a possibility should Manny Pangilinan's Metro Pacific attempts to purchase the entire system succeed. If and when this happens, the system may be theoretically controlled or connected to Line 1's current operating concessionaire, LRMC (Light Rail Manila Consortium), of whom Pangilinan has a controlling stake, paving the way to a possible line merger.\n\n====Transfer of operations from MRTC to LRTA====\nRecently, a new study for the Metro Manila Rail Network has been unveiled by DOTC Undersecretary for Public Information Dante Velasco that Lines 1, 2, and 3 will be under one management, the [[Light Rail Transit Authority]]. This is due to maintenance cost issues for Line 1's maintenance cost, which is approximately \u20b135 million, along with Line 2's \u20b125 million and Line 3's \u20b154 million maintenance costs. Another reason for this study is for the unification of the lines. According to DOTC Undersecretary for Rails Glicerio Sicat, the transfer was set by the government in June 2011.<ref name=\"operations\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/business-columns/36361-govt-creates-team-for-mrt-3-due-diligence-sets-june-takeover|title=Govt creates team for MRT-3 due diligence, sets June takeover|author=Amojelar, Darwin G.|date=December 28, 2010|work=[[The Manila Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011|publisher=Manila Times Publishing Corporation}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  However, it is unlikely that the private owners, MRTC, will approve this plan.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] Chief Rafael S.
