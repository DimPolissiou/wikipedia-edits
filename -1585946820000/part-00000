It is located on the [[Bay of Biscay]], approximately {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Oviedo]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/gijon|title=Distancia de Oviedo a Gij\u00f3n en coche|website=esdistancia.com|language=es|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> the capital of Asturias. \n\nGij\u00f3n is situated on the coast of the [[Cantabrian Sea]], in the north-west of Spain. It is located in the central-northern part of Asturias, 28 km from [[Oviedo]] and 26 km from [[Avil\u00e9s]], forming part of a large metropolitan area that includes twenty councils in the center of the region, structured with a dense network of roads, highways and railways and with a population of 835,053 inhabitants in 2011, making it the seventh largest in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fomento.gob.es/MFOM.CP.Web/handlers/pdfhandler.ashx?idpub=BAW013|title=Informaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica de las grandes \u00e1reas urbanas espa\u00f1olas|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Ministerio de fomento, ed.|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, Gij\u00f3n developed as an industrial city in the steel and naval industries. However, due to the decline in manufacturing in these industries, in recent years Gij\u00f3n is undergoing a transformation into an important tourist, university, commercial and R&D center. Gij\u00f3n is the location of the [[Radiotelevisi\u00f3n del Principado de Asturias]], the neighbourhood of [[Cimavilla]], the [[Universidad Laboral de Gij\u00f3n]], the Revillagigedo Palace, and the adjoining Collegiate Church of San Juan Bautista. \n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nOne theory is based on some early medieval texts mention it as \"Gigia\", derived from the identical Greek and Latin term \"gigias\", meaning \"giant\", both of which refer to the Greek mythological giant [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigas]]. The medieval \"Gigia\" name, in turn, more specifically would refer to the ancient Roman wall built on the peninsula of the Cimadevilla district of Gij\u00f3n. This wall was called the \"Gegionem\" by the Romans, and is itself a compound Latin term being either \"geg-ionem\", meaning \"giant-ness/gigantic\", \"gegi-onem\", meaning \"concrete giant\", or \"gegio-nem\" meaning \"giant end\". Presumably the use of the term meaning \"giant\" referred to either the pre-Germanic Astur peoples who inhabited the area being of large physical stature, or simply the largeness of the wall itself.\n\nThe name of the city might also come from the hypothetical roman actual name of the place \"Sessio\" which may have turned into the word \"Xix\u00f3n\" as the centuries went by. Then the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word \"Gij\u00f3n\", which has been also written during the Middle age as \"Jij\u00f3n\" or even \"Jix\u00f3n\", would be a Castilianization of the [[Asturian language|Asturian]] name. This theory is nowadays known as the most acceptable.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Gij\u00f3n}}\n\n===Prehistory and Romanization===\n[[File:Casona de Jovellanos - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Jovellanos]] birth house]]\nThe first evidence of human presence in what is known nowadays as the municipality of Gij\u00f3n is located on Monte Deva, where there exists a series of [[tumulus]], and on Monte Areo, where there are some neolithic dolmens. These dolmens were discovered in 1990 and were supposedly built around 5000 BC.<ref>Ayuntamiento de Gij\u00f3n (ed.). \"[https://www.gijon.info/page/6443-dolmenes-del-monte-areo D\u00f3lmenes del Monte Areo]\". Consultado el 28 de enero de 2016.</ref>\n\nThe first noticed settlement (Noega) is located in Campa Torres. It has its origin between the 6th and 5th centuries BC. It was populated by [[Astures]] (''Cil\u00farnigos'') and later Romanized. Noega was progressively abandoned when the Roman wall in the peninsula of [[Cimavilla]], called the ''Gegionem'', was built.\n\n===Middle Ages and Modern Era===\nThe invasions of barbarian tribes in the 5th and 6th centuries left no traces. The region submitted to the power of the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] king [[Sisebut]] in the 7th century. This period marks the beginnings of Christianization, one the first Christian worshipping place being the Roman villa of Veranes.\n\nGij\u00f3n was capital of the Muslim territories on the Cantabric Sea, under the power of [[Munuza]], for a short period between 713 and 718 or 722. In 722 the Asturians won the [[Battle of Covadonga]] which is regarded as the beginning of the 774 year Reconquista. The Asturian forces were led by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], who would become the first King of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].\n\nUntil 1270 there were no reliable references to Gij\u00f3n as a settlement, with only short mentions in some documents. In this year, [[Alfonso X of Castile]] gave it the status of ''puebla''. This documentation appears in the [[Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo|Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo.]]\n\nIn the 14th century, the war between [[Alfonso Enr\u00edquez, Count of Gij\u00f3n and Nore\u00f1a]] and [[Henry III of Castile]] ended when the village of Gij\u00f3n was burned and totally destroyed, practically disappearing. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Gij\u00f3n reemerged. A new dock was built in the port adding fishing and commerce to the area. In the 17th and 18th centuries Gij\u00f3n began to develop rapidly, growing out of the old city center, supported by the commercial links between the port of Gij\u00f3n and the American colonies. In the 18th century, due to the French invasions, the wars and the financial trouble in the era, the development stopped until late in the century, when the Oviedo-Gij\u00f3n road was created and the port was recognized as the best one in Asturias, favoring the start of industrial activities in the town.\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:Letronas de Gijon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern piece of art with the city name.]]\nThe 19th century brought with it great development, with the commerce of coal, the Gij\u00f3n\u2013[[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] road and later the [[Langreo]]\u2013Gij\u00f3n railway. All this contributed to the quick expansion of the port, since the intensity of the traffic overflowed the port. A new port, [[El Musel]], was built in 1893 and it was the first coal port of the peninsula.\n\nGij\u00f3n was going through a conversion to an industrial town with a new bourgeois and an urban development, opening new streets and squares, with new municipal equipments like water, garbage collection, lighting, and so on. All this industrial development brought new manpower to the city and the creation of new neighborhoods like Natahoyo, La Calzada, [[Trema\u00f1es]] or El Humedal.\n\nIn the 20th century, with the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city supported the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]]. The army was located in El Coto. The resistance was eliminated in August 1936. Later, the village was the capital of the [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le\u00f3n]] until 20 October 1937, when the troops of General [[Francisco Franco]] occupied the city.\n\nIron manufacture was the main industry of Gij\u00f3n from the last years of the 19th century until the last decades of the 20th. Uninsa was created in 1971, and it merged with Ensidesa. In the last years of the century was converted in [[Aceralia]], and integrated in [[Arcelor]], along with the Luxembourg-based [[ARBED|Arbed]] and the French company [[Usinor]].[[File:Elogio chillida gijon.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Eulogy to the Horizon'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]], one of the most known symbols of Gij\u00f3n.]]The last decades of the century brought an industrial crisis affecting mainly iron manufacture and local shipbuilding. This brought new terrain for the creation of new beaches, parks and neighborhoods. It was also created a campus of the [[University of Oviedo]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n== Geography ==\nThe city is situated on the coast of central Asturias, from sea level to an altitude of 513 metres at ''Picu Samart\u00edn'' and 672 metres at [[Pe\u00f1a de los Cuatro Jueces]], bordered on the West by [[Carre\u00f1o]], the East by [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]], and to the South by [[Siero]] and [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]]\n\nThe city is situated along the Asturian coast and is distinguished by the peninsula of [[Cimavilla]] (the original settlement) which separates the beach of San Lorenzo and adjacent neighborhoods to the east from the beaches of Poniente and Arbeyal, the shipyards, and the recreational port and the Port of [[El Musel]] to the west. It is close to the other main Asturian cities, [[Oviedo]] and [[Avil\u00e9s]].\n\n== Climate ==\nGij\u00f3n has a temperate [[oceanic climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=41080&cityname=Gijon%2C+Principado+de+Asturias%2C+Spain&units=|title=Gijon, Spain Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> typical of the Atlantic coast of Spain, with cool summers and wet and mostly mild winters.

The parish of Gij\u00f3n itself has 260 944 inhabitants. \n\nThe municipal population grew remarkably throughout the 20th century, especially between the 1960s and 1980s, a period in which it doubled. Starting in the 1990s, growth stagnated, reflecting the similar slowdown at the national level of Spain. However, due to immigration, both from other Asturias councils and from abroad, the population started to increase again at the turn of the 21st century. \n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Universidad Laboral gijon.jpg|thumb|[[Universidad Laboral de Gij\u00f3n]], today cultural center]]\n[[File:Gijon Iglesia San Pedro Apostol.jpg|thumb|San Pedro church]]\n[[File:Gijon - Antiguo Banco de Gij\u00f3n 01.JPG|thumb|right|The former Banco de Gij\u00f3n]]Gij\u00f3n is the cultural centre of the region of Asturias. Cultural activities are carried out throughout the year, which increase considerably in the summer months, especially in August due to the Feast of the Assumption, with parties, music and theater. This complements the continuous programming of the Teatro Municipal Jovellanos (Jovellanos Municipal Theater). The various festivities carried out in Gij\u00f3n include:\n\n* The Iberoamerican Book Fair, in May\n* The [[Semana Negra]] in July\n* The Feria Internacional de Muestras de Asturias\n* The [[Gij\u00f3n International Film Festival]]\n\nThe [[Universidad Laboral de Gij\u00f3n]], completed in 1955, contains the [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creaci\u00f3n Industrial]] (Laboral Center of Art and Industrial Creation). The center was inaugurated on March 30, 2007 as an interdisciplinary space to promote artistic exchange and foster the relationship between society, art, science, technology and the creative industries. \n\nIn recent years, Gij\u00f3n has become a stop city for the [[Cirque du Soleil]]. The performances of the Cirque du Soleil have been very successful in the city. In July 2004, Saltimbanco arrived and in the summer of 2007, they presented Alegr\u00eda in Gij\u00f3n, the first time that this tour stopped in northern Spain. During the summer of 2009, Cirque du Soleil returned to Gij\u00f3n with the Varekai show. \n\n=== Film ===\n[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Garci]] filmed most of the footage from the film ''[[Begin the Beguine (film)|Volver a empezar]]'' in the city during the early 1980s. The film would later win an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. In the early 1990s there was a boom in indie music bands in the town, which became known as the \"Xix\u00f3n Sound\". The comedy [[Mortadelo & Filemon: The Big Adventure]] was also filmed in part in the City of Culture of Gij\u00f3n. In 2009, the Laboral and its surroundings were converted to the University of Oxford for Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez Molina's film, [[Brain Drain (film)|Brain Drain]].\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\n* [[Museum of the Asturian People]]\n* [[Gij\u00f3n Railway Museum|Railway museum of Asturias]]\n* [[Nicanor Pi\u00f1ole museum]]\n* [[Roman Terms museum of Campo Vald\u00e9s]]\n* [[Juan Barjola Museum of Painting|Juan Barjola Museum]] (A museum about a local painter, also interested in [[avant-garde]] art)\n* [[Evaristo Valle museum]] (Local painter museum placed in a mansion at the outskirts)\n* [[International Bagpipe Museum]] contains [[bagpipe]]s from around the world, focusing on the [[Asturian language|Asturian]] musical heritage and bagpipes.\n* [[Atlantic botanical garden]]\n* Archaeological park [[Campa Torres]].\n* Revillagigedo Palace and museum (At Marqu\u00e9s square, near the City Hall)\n* [[Gij\u00f3n Aquarium]]\n* [[Roman Town of Veranes]]\n* [[LABoral Centro de Arte y Creaci\u00f3n Industrial]] (An exhibition center for contemporary art, science, technology and advanced visual industries)\n\n===Universities===\nThere are two campuses located in Gij\u00f3n, one of the [[University of Oviedo]] and other of the [[National University of Distance Education]].\n\n====University of Oviedo====\n* [[Gij\u00f3n Polytechnic School of Engineering]].\nMechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Computers and Systems Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Telecommunication Engineering.\n* School of Civil Navy.\n* Faculty of Commerce, Tourism and Social Sciences \"Jovellanos\".\nPublic Administration and Management, Trade and Marketing, Tourism and Social work.\n\n====National University of Distance Education (UNED)====\nGij\u00f3n also has a delegation of the [[National University of Distance Education|UNED]], where different disciplines can be studied by distance.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:ElMolinonSportingvsAthletic30-10-11.jpg|thumb|[[Estadio El Molin\u00f3n]], in a game of Sporting de Gij\u00f3n in [[La Liga]].]]\n{{See also|Category:Sport in Gij\u00f3n}}\nIn team sports, Gij\u00f3n's professional [[Association football|football]] team, [[Sporting de Gij\u00f3n]], currently plays in the Spanish [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|second division]].

It is located on the [[Bay of Biscay]], approximately {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Oviedo]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://esdistancia.com/route/oviedo/gijon|title=Distancia de Oviedo a Gij\u00f3n en coche|website=esdistancia.com|language=es|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> the capital of Asturias. \n\nGij\u00f3n is situated on the coast of the [[Cantabrian Sea]], in the north-west of Spain. It is located in the central-northern part of Asturias, 28 km from [[Oviedo]] and 26 km from [[Avil\u00e9s]], forming part of a large metropolitan area that includes twenty councils in the center of the region, structured with a dense network of roads, highways and railways and with a population of 835,053 inhabitants in 2011, making it the seventh largest in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fomento.gob.es/MFOM.CP.Web/handlers/pdfhandler.ashx?idpub=BAW013|title=Informaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica de las grandes \u00e1reas urbanas espa\u00f1olas|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Ministerio de fomento, ed.|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, Gij\u00f3n developed as an industrial city in the steel and naval industries. However, due to the decline in manufacturing in these industries, in recent years Gij\u00f3n is undergoing a transformation into an important tourist, university, commercial and R&D center. Gij\u00f3n is the location of the [[Radiotelevisi\u00f3n del Principado de Asturias]], the neighbourhood of [[Cimavilla]], the [[Universidad Laboral de Gij\u00f3n]], the Revillagigedo Palace, and the adjoining Collegiate Church of San Juan Bautista. \n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nOne theory is based on some early medieval texts mention it as \"Gigia\", derived from the identical Greek and Latin term \"gigias\", meaning \"giant\", both of which refer to the Greek mythological giant [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Gigas]]. The medieval \"Gigia\" name, in turn, more specifically would refer to the ancient Roman wall built on the peninsula of the Cimadevilla district of Gij\u00f3n. This wall was called the \"Gegionem\" by the Romans, and is itself a compound Latin term being either \"geg-ionem\", meaning \"giant-ness/gigantic\", \"gegi-onem\", meaning \"concrete giant\", or \"gegio-nem\" meaning \"giant end\". Presumably the use of the term meaning \"giant\" referred to either the pre-Germanic Astur peoples who inhabited the area being of large physical stature, or simply the largeness of the wall itself.\n\nThe name of the city might also come from the hypothetical roman actual name of the place \"Sessio\" which may have turned into the word \"Xix\u00f3n\" as the centuries went by. Then the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word \"Gij\u00f3n\", which has been also written during the Middle age as \"Jij\u00f3n\" or even \"Jix\u00f3n\", would be a Castilianization of the [[Asturian language|Asturian]] name. This theory is nowadays known as the most acceptable.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Gij\u00f3n}}\n\n===Prehistory and Romanization===\n[[File:Casona de Jovellanos - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos|Jovellanos]] birth house]]\nThe first evidence of human presence in what is known nowadays as the municipality of Gij\u00f3n is located on Monte Deva, where there exists a series of [[tumulus]], and on Monte Areo, where there are some neolithic dolmens. These dolmens were discovered in 1990 and were supposedly built around 5000 BC.<ref>Ayuntamiento de Gij\u00f3n (ed.). \"[https://www.gijon.info/page/6443-dolmenes-del-monte-areo D\u00f3lmenes del Monte Areo]\". Consultado el 28 de enero de 2016.</ref>\n\nThe first noticed settlement (Noega) is located in Campa Torres. It has its origin between the 6th and 5th centuries BC. It was populated by [[Astures]] (''Cil\u00farnigos'') and later Romanized. Noega was progressively abandoned when the Roman wall in the peninsula of [[Cimavilla]], called the ''Gegionem'', was built.\n\n===Middle Ages and Modern Era===\nThe invasions of barbarian tribes in the 5th and 6th centuries left no traces. The region submitted to the power of the [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] king [[Sisebut]] in the 7th century. This period marks the beginnings of Christianization, one the first Christian worshipping place being the Roman villa of Veranes.\n\nGij\u00f3n was capital of the Muslim territories on the Cantabric Sea, under the power of [[Munuza]], for a short period between 713 and 718 or 722. In 722 the Asturians won the [[Battle of Covadonga]] which is regarded as the beginning of the 774 year Reconquista. The Asturian forces were led by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], who would become the first King of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]].\n\nUntil 1270 there were no reliable references to Gij\u00f3n as a settlement, with only short mentions in some documents. In this year, [[Alfonso X of Castile]] gave it the status of ''puebla''. This documentation appears in the [[Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo|Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo.]]\n\nIn the 14th century, the war between [[Alfonso Enr\u00edquez, Count of Gij\u00f3n and Nore\u00f1a]] and [[Henry III of Castile]] ended when the village of Gij\u00f3n was burned and totally destroyed, practically disappearing. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Gij\u00f3n reemerged. A new dock was built in the port adding fishing and commerce to the area. In the 17th and 18th centuries Gij\u00f3n began to develop rapidly, growing out of the old city center, supported by the commercial links between the port of Gij\u00f3n and the American colonies. In the 18th century, due to the French invasions, the wars and the financial trouble in the era, the development stopped until late in the century, when the Oviedo-Gij\u00f3n road was created and the port was recognized as the best one in Asturias, favoring the start of industrial activities in the town.\n\n===Contemporary history===\n[[File:Letronas de Gijon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern piece of art with the city name.]]\nThe 19th century brought with it great development, with the commerce of coal, the Gij\u00f3n\u2013[[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] road and later the [[Langreo]]\u2013Gij\u00f3n railway. All this contributed to the quick expansion of the port, since the intensity of the traffic overflowed the port. A new port, [[El Musel]], was built in 1893 and it was the first coal port of the peninsula.\n\nGij\u00f3n was going through a conversion to an industrial town with a new bourgeois and an urban development, opening new streets and squares, with new municipal equipments like water, garbage collection, lighting, and so on. All this industrial development brought new manpower to the city and the creation of new neighborhoods like Natahoyo, La Calzada, [[Trema\u00f1es]] or El Humedal.\n\nIn the 20th century, with the [[Spanish Civil War]], the city supported the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]]. The army was located in El Coto. The resistance was eliminated in August 1936. Later, the village was the capital of the [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le\u00f3n]] until 20 October 1937, when the troops of General [[Francisco Franco]] occupied the city.\n\nIron manufacture was the main industry of Gij\u00f3n from the last years of the 19th century until the last decades of the 20th. Uninsa was created in 1971, and it merged with Ensidesa. In the last years of the century was converted in [[Aceralia]], and integrated in [[Arcelor]], along with the Luxembourg-based [[ARBED|Arbed]] and the French company [[Usinor]].[[File:Elogio chillida gijon.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Eulogy to the Horizon'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]], one of the most known symbols of Gij\u00f3n.]]The last decades of the century brought an industrial crisis affecting mainly iron manufacture and local shipbuilding. This brought new terrain for the creation of new beaches, parks and neighborhoods. It was also created a campus of the [[University of Oviedo]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n== Geography ==\nThe city is situated on the coast of central Asturias, from sea level to an altitude of 513 metres at ''Picu Samart\u00edn'' and 672 metres at [[Pe\u00f1a de los Cuatro Jueces]], bordered on the West by [[Carre\u00f1o]], the East by [[Villaviciosa, Asturias|Villaviciosa]], and to the South by [[Siero]] and [[Llanera, Asturias|Llanera]]\n\nThe city is situated along the Asturian coast and is distinguished by the peninsula of [[Cimavilla]] (the original settlement) which separates the beach of San Lorenzo and adjacent neighborhoods to the east from the beaches of Poniente and Arbeyal, the shipyards, and the recreational port and the Port of [[El Musel]] to the west. It is close to the other main Asturian cities, [[Oviedo]] and [[Avil\u00e9s]].\n\n== Climate ==\nGij\u00f3n has a temperate [[oceanic climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=41080&cityname=Gijon%2C+Principado+de+Asturias%2C+Spain&units=|title=Gijon, Spain Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref> typical of the Atlantic coast of Spain, with cool summers and wet and mostly mild winters.

He built bridges and buildings in Stockholm and founded Sweden's first rubber factory. His construction work inspired him to research new methods of blasting rock that were more effective than black powder. After some bad business deals in Sweden, in 1838 Immanuel moved [[Nobel family|his family]] to [[Saint Petersburg]], where Alfred and his brothers were educated privately under Swedish and Russian tutors. At age 17, Alfred was [[grand tour|sent abroad for two years]]; in the United States he met Swedish engineer [[John Ericsson]] and in France studied under famed chemist [[Th\u00e9ophile-Jules Pelouze]] and his pupil [[Ascanio Sobrero]] who had first synthesized [[nitroglycerin]] in 1847. It was in France that Nobel first encountered nitroglycerin, which Pelouze cautioned against using as a commercial explosive because of its great sensitivity to shock.<ref name=\"tekniskamuseet\">{{cite web|title=Alfred Nobel \u2013 Dynamit|url=https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/lar-dig-mer/svenska-uppfinnare-och-innovatorer/alfred-nobel-dynamit/|publisher=[[Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology]] |accessdate=1 October 2017|language=sv-SE}}</ref> \n\nIn 1857, Nobel filed the first of several hundred patents, mostly concerning air pressure, gas and fluid gauges, but remained fascinated with nitroglycerin's potential as an explosive. Nobel, along with his father and brother [[Emil Oskar Nobel|Emil]], experimented with various combinations of nitroglycerin and black powder. Nobel came up with a solution of how to safely detonate nitroglycerin by inventing the [[detonator]], or blasting cap, that allowed a controlled explosion set off from a distance using a [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. In the summer of 1863, Nobel performed his first successful detonation of pure nitroglycerin, using a blasting cap made of a copper [[percussion cap]] and [[Mercury(II) fulminate|mercury fulminate]]. In 1864, Alfred Nobel filed patents for both the blasting cap and his method of synthesizing nitroglycerin, using sulfuric acid, nitric acid and glycerin. On 3 September 1864, while experimenting with nitroglycerin, Emil and several others were killed in an explosion at the factory at Immanuel Nobel's estate at [[Heleneborg]]. After this, Alfred founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in [[Vinterviken]] to continue work in a more isolated area and the following year moved to Germany, where he founded another company, [[Dynamit Nobel]].<ref name=\"tekniskamuseet\"/> \n\nDespite the invention of the blasting cap, the volatility of nitroglycerin rendered it useless as a commercial explosive. To solve this problem, Nobel sought to combine it with another substance that would make it safe for transport and handling but yet would not reduce its effectiveness as an explosive. He tried combinations of cement, coal, and sawdust, but was unsuccessful. Finally, he tried [[diatomaceous earth]], fossilized algae, that he brought from the [[Elbe River]] near his factory in [[Hamburg]], which successfully stabilized the nitroglycerin into a portable explosive.<ref name=\"tekniskamuseet\"/> \n\nNobel obtained [[patent]]s for his inventions in England on 7 May 1867 and in Sweden on 19 October 1867.<ref name=\"s&s-101\">Sch\u00fcck & Sohlman (1929), p. 101.</ref> After its introduction, dynamite rapidly gained wide-scale use as a safe alternative to [[black powder]] and [[nitroglycerin]].

Therefore, while the risk of an explosion without the use of a [[blasting cap]] is minimal for fresh dynamite, old dynamite is dangerous. Modern packaging helps eliminate this by placing the dynamite into sealed plastic bags, and using wax-coated cardboard.\n\nDynamite is moderately sensitive to shock. Shock resistance tests are usually carried out with a drop-hammer: about 100&nbsp;mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between {{convert|0.5|and|10|kg|lb}} is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved.<ref>Carlos L\u00f3pez Jimeno, Emilio L\u00f3pez Jimeno, Francisco Javier Ayala-Carcedo, ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks'', translated by Yvonne Visser de Ramiro from ''Manual de perforaci\u00f3n y voladura de rocas'' (1987), Geomining Technological Institute of Spain (Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Geominero de Espan~a), Taylor & Francis, London and New York, 1995, {{ISBN|90-5410-199-7}}</ref> With a hammer of 2&nbsp;kg, [[mercury fulminate]] detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2&nbsp;cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5&nbsp;cm, dynamite with 15 to 30&nbsp;cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n===Major manufacturers===\n[[File:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]\n\n====South Africa====\nFor several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases, {{convert|50|lb|kg|order=flip}} each, annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.<ref>[http://www.caia.co.za/index.php?pg=18 AECI: South Africa \u2013 History of the Chemical Industry]</ref>\n\nThere were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nDynamite was first manufactured in the U.S. by the [[Giant Powder Company]] of [[San Francisco, California]], whose founder had obtained the exclusive rights from Nobel in 1867.  Giant was eventually acquired by [[DuPont]], which produced dynamite under the Giant name until Giant was dissolved by DuPont in 1905.<ref>[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc38234/m1/147/ ''US v. Du Pont'' 188 Fed 127, 147]</ref>\nThereafter, DuPont produced dynamite under its own name until 1911\u201312 when its explosives monopoly was broken up by the U.S. Circuit Court in the \"Powder Case\". \nTwo new companies were formed upon the breakup, the [[Hercules Powder Company]] and the Atlas Powder Company, which took up the manufacture of dynamite (in different formulations) thereafter.\n\nCurrently only [[Dyno Nobel]] manufactures dynamite in the US. The only facility producing it is located in [[Carthage, Missouri]], but the material is purchased from Dyno Nobel by other manufacturers, who put their labels on the dynamite and boxes.\n\n==Non-dynamite explosives==\nOther explosives are often referred to or confused with dynamite:\n\n===TNT===\n[[TNT]] is most commonly assumed to be the same as (or confused for) dynamite, largely due to the ubiquity of both explosives during the 20th century and the civilian practice of preparing dynamite charges in 8x1\" \"sticks\" wrapped in red waxed paper and shaped to fit the cylindrical [[borehole]]s drilled in the rock face. This incorrect connection between TNT and dynamite was enhanced by [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons where animators started labeling ''any'' kind of cartoon bomb (ranging from sticks of dynamite to kegs of [[black powder]]) as \"TNT\" because the acronym was shorter, more memorable and didn't require [[literacy]] to recognize \"TNT\" meant \"bomb\" (similar to the use of XXX markings on [[whiskey]] bottles and barrels in cartoons). This eventually led to the general perception that TNT and dynamite were one and the same.\n\nIn actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation [[Use_forms_of_explosives#Castings|castable explosive]] adopted by the military. The German armed forces adopted it as a filling for artillery shells in 1902, some 40 years after the invention of dynamite, which is a 1st generation [[phlegmatized explosive]] primarily intended for civilian earthmoving. TNT has never been popular or widespread in civilian earthmoving, as it is considerably more expensive and less powerful by weight than dynamite,<ref name=Meyer2008>J. K\u00f6hler, R. Meyer, A. Homburg: ''Explosivstoffe.'' Zehnte, vollst\u00e4ndig \u00fcberarbeitete Auflage. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-527-32009-7}}.</ref> as well as being slower to mix and pack into cylindrical boreholes; for its part, dynamite has never been popular in warfare because it degenerates quickly under severe conditions and can be detonated by either fire or a wayward bullet. TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a [[blasting cap]] (or a [[sympathetic detonation]]); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at {{convert|178|F|C}}, poured into [[shell (projectile)|high explosive shells]] and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics.<ref>Gibbs, T.R. & Popolato, A. ''LASL Explosive Property Data''. [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], New Mexico. [[USDOE]], 1980.</ref> As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, [[hand grenades]] and [[aerial bombs]] and the remainder being packaged in brown \"bricks\" (not red cylinders) for use as [[satchel charge|demolition charges]] by [[combat engineers]].\n\n===\"Extra\" dynamite===\nIn the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented \"ammonium dynamite\", a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. Ammonium nitrate has only 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin.\n\nIt is rated by either \"weight strength\" (the amount of ammonium nitrate in the medium) or \"cartridge strength\" (the [[Strength (explosive)|potential explosive strength]] generated by an amount of explosive of a certain density and grain size used in comparison to the explosive strength generated by an equivalent density and grain size of a standard explosive). For example, high-explosive ''65% Extra Dynamite'' has a weight strength of 65% ammonium nitrate and 35% \"dope\" (the absorbent medium mixed with the stabilizers and additives). Its \"cartridge strength\" would be its weight in pounds times its strength in relation to an equal amount of [[ANFO]] (the civilian baseline standard) or [[TNT]] (the military baseline standard). For example, 65% ammonium dynamite with a 20% cartridge strength would mean the stick was equal to an equivalent weight strength of 20% ANFO.\n\n===\"Military dynamite\"===\n\"Military dynamite\" is a dynamite substitute, formulated without nitroglycerin. It contains 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but is much safer to store and handle for long periods than Nobel's dynamite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref> Military dynamite substitutes much more stable chemicals for nitroglycerin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&pg=PA498|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-615-14794-9}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n{{Main article|Explosive material#Regulation}}\nVarious countries around the world have enacted explosives laws and require licenses to manufacture, distribute, store, use, and possess explosives or ingredients.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Blast fishing]]\n* [[Blasting machine]]\n* [[Dynamite gun]]\n* [[Nobel Prize]]\n* [[Relative effectiveness factor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cartwright, A.

Shock resistance tests are usually carried out with a drop-hammer: about 100&nbsp;mg of explosive is placed on an anvil, upon which a weight of between {{convert|0.5|and|10|kg|lb}} is dropped from different heights until detonation is achieved.<ref>Carlos L\u00f3pez Jimeno, Emilio L\u00f3pez Jimeno, Francisco Javier Ayala-Carcedo, ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks'', translated by Yvonne Visser de Ramiro from ''Manual de perforaci\u00f3n y voladura de rocas'' (1987), Geomining Technological Institute of Spain (Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Geominero de Espan~a), Taylor & Francis, London and New York, 1995, {{ISBN|90-5410-199-7}}</ref> With a hammer of 2&nbsp;kg, [[mercury fulminate]] detonates with a drop distance of 1 to 2&nbsp;cm, nitroglycerin with 4 to 5&nbsp;cm, dynamite with 15 to 30&nbsp;cm, and ammoniacal explosives with 40 to 50&nbsp;cm.\n\n===Major manufacturers===\n[[File:Aetna dynamite.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertisement for the Aetna Explosives Company of New York.]]\n\n====South Africa====\nFor several decades beginning in the 1940s, the largest producer of dynamite in the world was the [[Union of South Africa]]. There the [[De Beers]] company established a factory in 1902 at [[Somerset West]]. The explosives factory was later operated by [[AECI]] (African Explosives and Chemical Industries). The demand for the product came mainly from the country's vast gold mines, centered on the [[Witwatersrand]]. The factory at Somerset West was in operation in 1903 and by 1907 it was already producing 340,000 cases, {{convert|50|lb|kg|order=flip}} each, annually. A rival factory at Modderfontein was producing another 200,000 cases per year.<ref>[http://www.caia.co.za/index.php?pg=18 AECI: South Africa \u2013 History of the Chemical Industry]</ref>\n\nThere were two large explosions at the Somerset West plant during the 1960s. Some workers died, but the loss of life was limited by the modular design of the factory and its earth works, and the planting of trees that directed the blasts upward. There were several other explosions at the Modderfontein factory. After 1985, pressure from trade unions forced AECI to phase out the production of dynamite. The factory then went on to produce ammonium nitrate emulsion-based explosives that are safer to manufacture and handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630050905/http://www.aeci.co.za/New/History/1980.htm |archivedate=30 June 2006 |title=Historical Highlights 1980's |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nDynamite was first manufactured in the U.S. by the [[Giant Powder Company]] of [[San Francisco, California]], whose founder had obtained the exclusive rights from Nobel in 1867.  Giant was eventually acquired by [[DuPont]], which produced dynamite under the Giant name until Giant was dissolved by DuPont in 1905.<ref>[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc38234/m1/147/ ''US v. Du Pont'' 188 Fed 127, 147]</ref>\nThereafter, DuPont produced dynamite under its own name until 1911\u201312 when its explosives monopoly was broken up by the U.S. Circuit Court in the \"Powder Case\". \nTwo new companies were formed upon the breakup, the [[Hercules Powder Company]] and the Atlas Powder Company, which took up the manufacture of dynamite (in different formulations) thereafter.\n\nCurrently only [[Dyno Nobel]] manufactures dynamite in the US. The only facility producing it is located in [[Carthage, Missouri]], but the material is purchased from Dyno Nobel by other manufacturers, who put their labels on the dynamite and boxes.\n\n==Non-dynamite explosives==\nOther explosives are often referred to or confused with dynamite:\n\n===TNT===\n[[TNT]] is most commonly assumed to be the same as (or confused for) dynamite, largely due to the ubiquity of both explosives during the 20th century and the civilian practice of preparing dynamite charges in 8x1\" \"sticks\" wrapped in red waxed paper and shaped to fit the cylindrical [[borehole]]s drilled in the rock face. This incorrect connection between TNT and dynamite was enhanced by [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons where animators started labeling ''any'' kind of cartoon bomb (ranging from sticks of dynamite to kegs of [[black powder]]) as \"TNT\" because the acronym was shorter, more memorable and didn't require [[literacy]] to recognize \"TNT\" meant \"bomb\" (similar to the use of XXX markings on [[whiskey]] bottles and barrels in cartoons). This eventually led to the general perception that TNT and dynamite were one and the same.\n\nIn actuality, aside from both being high explosives, TNT and dynamite have very little in common: TNT is a 2nd generation [[Use_forms_of_explosives#Castings|castable explosive]] adopted by the military. The German armed forces adopted it as a filling for artillery shells in 1902, some 40 years after the invention of dynamite, which is a 1st generation [[phlegmatized explosive]] primarily intended for civilian earthmoving. TNT has never been popular or widespread in civilian earthmoving, as it is considerably more expensive and less powerful by weight than dynamite,<ref name=Meyer2008>J. K\u00f6hler, R. Meyer, A. Homburg: ''Explosivstoffe.'' Zehnte, vollst\u00e4ndig \u00fcberarbeitete Auflage. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-527-32009-7}}.</ref> as well as being slower to mix and pack into cylindrical boreholes; for its part, dynamite has never been popular in warfare because it degenerates quickly under severe conditions and can be detonated by either fire or a wayward bullet. TNT's primary asset is its remarkable insensitivity and stability: it is waterproof and incapable of detonating without the extreme shock and heat provided by a [[blasting cap]] (or a [[sympathetic detonation]]); this conveniently also allows it to be melted at {{convert|178|F|C}}, poured into [[shell (projectile)|high explosive shells]] and allowed to re-solidify with no extra danger or change in the TNT's characteristics.<ref>Gibbs, T.R. & Popolato, A. ''LASL Explosive Property Data''. [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], New Mexico. [[USDOE]], 1980.</ref> As such, more than 90% of the TNT produced in America was always for the military market, with most filling shells, [[hand grenades]] and [[aerial bombs]] and the remainder being packaged in brown \"bricks\" (not red cylinders) for use as [[satchel charge|demolition charges]] by [[combat engineers]].\n\n===\"Extra\" dynamite===\nIn the United States, in 1885, the chemist Russell S. Penniman invented \"ammonium dynamite\", a form of explosive that used [[ammonium nitrate]] as a substitute for the more costly nitroglycerin. Ammonium nitrate has only 85% of the [[chemical energy]] of nitroglycerin.\n\nIt is rated by either \"weight strength\" (the amount of ammonium nitrate in the medium) or \"cartridge strength\" (the [[Strength (explosive)|potential explosive strength]] generated by an amount of explosive of a certain density and grain size used in comparison to the explosive strength generated by an equivalent density and grain size of a standard explosive). For example, high-explosive ''65% Extra Dynamite'' has a weight strength of 65% ammonium nitrate and 35% \"dope\" (the absorbent medium mixed with the stabilizers and additives). Its \"cartridge strength\" would be its weight in pounds times its strength in relation to an equal amount of [[ANFO]] (the civilian baseline standard) or [[TNT]] (the military baseline standard). For example, 65% ammonium dynamite with a 20% cartridge strength would mean the stick was equal to an equivalent weight strength of 20% ANFO.\n\n===\"Military dynamite\"===\n\"Military dynamite\" is a dynamite substitute, formulated without nitroglycerin. It contains 75% [[RDX]], 15% TNT, 5% SAE 10 motor oil, and 5% cornstarch, but is much safer to store and handle for long periods than Nobel's dynamite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uxoinfo.com/uxoinfo/ordfillers.cfm |title=Unexploded Ordnance Information: Ordnance Fillers |publisher=Uxoinfo.com |accessdate=9 June 2012}}</ref> Military dynamite substitutes much more stable chemicals for nitroglycerin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ledgard |first=Jared |title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6f-Qlmm6zIC&pg=PA498|year=2007 |isbn=978-0-615-14794-9}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n{{Main article|Explosive material#Regulation}}\nVarious countries around the world have enacted explosives laws and require licenses to manufacture, distribute, store, use, and possess explosives or ingredients.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Blast fishing]]\n* [[Blasting machine]]\n* [[Dynamite gun]]\n* [[Nobel Prize]]\n* [[Relative effectiveness factor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cartwright, A.

It is one [[Phase (matter)|state]] of water within the [[hydrosphere]]. Water [[vapor]] can be produced from the [[evaporation]] or [[boiling]] of liquid water or from the [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of [[ice]]. Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Water Vapor?|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm|accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by [[condensation]]. It is less dense than most of the other constituents of [[air]] and triggers [[convection]] currents that can lead to clouds.\n\nBeing a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in [[Earth's atmosphere]] where it is also a potent [[greenhouse gas]] along with other gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. Use of water vapor, as [[steam]], has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].\n\nWater vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the [[solar atmosphere]] as well as every planet in the [[Solar System]] and many [[astronomical object]]s including [[natural satellite]]s, [[comet]]s and even large [[asteroid]]s. Likewise the detection of [[Extrasolar object|extrasolar]] water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Evaporation ===\nWhenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have [[Evaporation|evaporated]]. Each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of [[kinetic energy]]. The aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules. Liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called [[evaporative cooling]].<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=36}}</ref> The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface. When a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.\n\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \"pan\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId%3D208 |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412215652/http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId=208 |archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}</ref> The measurements range from under 30 to over 120&nbsp;inches per year. Formulas can be used for calculating the rate of evaporation from a water surface such as a swimming pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thermexcel.com/english/program/pool.htm|title=swimming, pool, calculation, evaporation, water, thermal, temperature, humidity, vapor, excel|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/equations.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324232701/http://www.rlmartin.com/rspec/whatis/equations.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2008 |title=Summary of Results of all Pool Evaporation Rate Studies |publisher=R. L. Martin & Associates}}</ref> In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] rate.\n\nEvaporative cooling is restricted by [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|atmospheric conditions]]. [[Humidity]] is the amount of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as [[hygrometer]]s. The measurements are usually expressed as [[specific humidity]] or percent [[relative humidity]]. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0&nbsp;gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30&nbsp;grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53259/climate#292984.hook|title=climate - meteorology|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align     = right\n |width1    = 165\n |width2    = 176\n |image1    = Meteorite Recovery Antarctica (retouched).jpg\n |image2    = Tightjunction BBB.jpg\n |caption1  = Recovery of [[meteorite]]s in Antarctica ([[ANSMET]])\n |caption2  = [[Electron micrograph]] of freeze-etched [[capillary]] tissue\n}}\n\n=== Sublimation ===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. [[Antarctica]] shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where [[Millennium|millennial]] layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of [[meteorite]]s that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.\n\nSublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Typically the specimens are prepared by [[cryofixation]] and [[Electron microscope|freeze-fracture]], after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, [[organelle]] structures and [[lipid bilayer]]s with very low degrees of distortion.\n\n=== Condensation ===\n[[File:Above the Clouds.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clouds, formed by condensed water vapour]]\n\nWater vapour will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the [[dew point]] temperature, or when the [[saturation vapour pressure|water vapour equilibrium]] in air has been exceeded. When water vapour condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly.<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=19}}</ref> In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by [[cloud condensation nuclei]]). The [[dew point]] of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapour in the air begins to condense concluding water vapour is a type of water or rain.\n\nAlso, a net condensation of water vapour occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere. [[Deposition (meteorology)|Deposition]] is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapour. [[Frost]] and snow are examples of deposition.\n\nThere are many mechanism of cooling by which condensation occurs \n1.direct loss of heat known as radiation cooling.\n2.cooling with upliftment of air known as adiabatic cooling.\nthere are 4 types of upliftment of air:\na. orographic upliftment- mountains work as barrier for upliftment of air\nb. convectional upliftment- upliftment of air due to pressure difference \nc. frontal upliftment- upliftment of air due to temp difference\nd. cyclonic upliftment but not related to temp\n3.advective cooling- cooling due to horizontal movement of air.\n HAHAH CORONAS TAKING OVER\n\n=== Chemical reactions ===\nA number of chemical reactions have water as a product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrocarbon]]s in air or other [[oxygen]] containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.\n\nIn a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as [[rust]] on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain [[polyurethane]] foams and [[cyanoacrylate]] glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for [[humidity indicator card|measurement]].\n\n=== Measurement ===\nMeasuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy.

At max. saturation (i. e. rel. humidity = 100 % at 0 \u00b0C) the density will go down to 28.51 g/mol.\n* STP conditions imply a temperature of 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted. Its [[concentration]] in air is very low at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. The red line on the chart to the right is the maximum concentration of water vapor expected for a given temperature. The water vapor concentration increases significantly as the temperature rises, approaching 100% ([[steam]], pure water vapor) at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist (0.598 vs. 1.27 g/l).\n\n==== At equal temperatures ====\nAt the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic [[nitrogen]] and diatomic [[oxygen]] both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] and [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).\n\n=== Respiration and breathing ===\nWater vapor is a by-product of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its [[partial pressure]] contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases [[partial pressure|(Dalton's Law)]]. The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.\n\nThis can have an effect on respiration. In very warm air (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.\n\n=== Lifting gas ===\nWater vapor has lower density than that of [[air]] and is therefore [[buoyant]] in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. When water vapor is used as a [[lifting gas]] by a [[thermal airship]] the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical \"steam balloon\", which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodey\n|first=Thomas J. |title=Steam Balloons and Steam Airships |url=http://www.flyingkettle.com/jbfa.htm |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== General discussion ===\nThe amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the [[water cycle]]. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain. The ''balance'' between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called [[vapor pressure|vapor partial pressure]].\n\nThe maximum partial pressure (''saturation pressure'') of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture. A variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the [[Goff-Gratch equation]] for the SVP over liquid water below zero degree Celsius:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\log_{10} \\left( p \\right) =\n& -7.90298 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right) + 5.02808 \\log_{10} \\frac{373.16}{T} \\\\\n& - 1.3816 \\times 10^{-7} \\left( 10^{11.344 \\left( 1-\\frac{T}{373.16} \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + 8.1328 \\times 10^{-3} \\left( 10^{-3.49149 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + \\log_{10} \\left( 1013.246 \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|T}}, temperature of the moist air, is given in units of [[kelvin]], and {{mvar|p}} is given in units of [[millibar]]s ([[hectopascal]]s).\n\nThe formula is valid from about \u221250 to 102&nbsp;\u00b0C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water. There are a number of other formulae which can be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/~voemel/vp.html|title=Water Vapor Pressure Formulations|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnder certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity. This immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.\n\n[[Exhalation|Exhale]]d air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or [[mist]] of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of [[exhaled breath condensate]], an evolving medical diagnostic test.\n\nControlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]] (HVAC) industry. [[Thermal comfort]] depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called [[refrigeration]], and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or ''food cases'', which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.\n\n== {{anchor|Water vapor in Earth's atmosphere}} In Earth's atmosphere ==\n[[File:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Evidence for increasing amounts of stratospheric water vapor over time in Boulder, Colorado.]]\n{{further|Atmosphere of Earth}}\n\nGaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42&nbsp;\u00b0C (-44&nbsp;\u00b0F)<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 34, Fig. 4.3a}}</ref> to 4.24% when the dew point is 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 36 example 4.1}}</ref> Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the [[troposphere]]. The [[condensation]] of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for [[clouds]], rain, snow, and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the [[latent heat of vaporization]], which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric [[convection]] is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as [[tropical cyclones]] and severe [[thunderstorms]]. Water vapor is the most potent [[greenhouse gas]] owing to the presence of the [[hydroxyl]] bond which strongly absorbs in the [[infra-red]] region of the [[light spectrum]].\n\nWater vapor is the \"working medium\" of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine which transforms heat energy from sun irradiation into mechanical energy in the form of winds. Transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy requires an upper and a lower temperature level, as well as a working medium which shuttles forth and back between both. The upper temperature level is given by the soil or water surface of the earth, which absorbs the incoming sun radiation and warms up, evaporating water. The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surrounding and raises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow. The now heavier cold and dry air sinks down to ground as well; the atmospheric thermodynamic engine thus establishes a vertical convection, which transports heat from the ground into the upper atmosphere, where the water molecules can radiate it to outer space. Due to the earth rotation and the resulting Coriolis forces, this vertical atmospheric convection is also converted into a horizontal convection, in the form of cyclones and anticyclones, which transport the water evaporated over the oceans into the interior of the continents, enabling vegetation to grow. <ref> https://web.stanford.edu/~ajlucas/The%20Atmosphere%20as%20a%20Heat%20Engine.pdf </ref>\n\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100&nbsp;\u00b0C), but [[Tropopause|at altitude]] it [[Lapse rate|goes below]] its freezing point (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), due to water's [[Hydrogen bond|highly polar attraction]]. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant [[dew point]] and [[Dew point#frost point|frost point]], unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane.

In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures. Under persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitate]] when they reach a critical mass.\n\nThe water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25&nbsp;mm deep.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air \u2013 on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the [[troposphere]] is about 9 to 10 days.\n\nEpisodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Such eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is trivial. The relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by [[volcano]]es varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site. However, water vapor is consistently the commonest [[volcanic gas]]; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a [[subaerial eruption]].<ref>{{harvp|Sigurdsson|Houghton|2000}}</ref>\n\nAtmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures. These include vapor pressure, [[specific humidity]], mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and [[relative humidity]].\n\n=== Radar and satellite imaging ===\n[[File:MYDAL2 M SKY WV.ogv|thumb|These maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month.(''click for more detail'')]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|[[MODIS]]/[[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] global mean atmospheric water vapor in atm-cm (centimeters of water in an atmospheric column if it condensed)]]\n\nBecause water molecules [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] [[microwave]]s and other [[radio wave]] frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates [[radar]] signals.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|p=23.5}}</ref> In addition, atmospheric water will [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] and [[refraction|refract]] signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.\n\nGenerally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere. Different frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others. Radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.\n\nWater vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water's other two phases. In the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual [[molecule]]; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|pp=2.44\u20132.54}}</ref>\n\nA comparison of [[GOES-12]] satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the [[precipitable water]] or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV|title=Water Vapor |publisher=Global Maps|accessdate=February 26, 2016|date=2018-07-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]]) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.

From [[cloud physics]], usually clouds are the real generators of static [[electric charge|charge]] as found in Earth's atmosphere. The ability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.\n\nThe amount of water vapor directly controls the [[permittivity]] of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=165\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nAfter a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or [[electrical insulation|insulator]]) that decreases the ability of the cloud to [[electrostatic discharge|discharge]] its electrical energy.

It is one [[Phase (matter)|state]] of water within the [[hydrosphere]]. Water [[vapor]] can be produced from the [[evaporation]] or [[boiling]] of liquid water or from the [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of [[ice]]. Water vapor is transparent, like most constituents of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Water Vapor?|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_is_water_vapor.htm|accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Under typical atmospheric conditions, water vapor is continuously generated by evaporation and removed by [[condensation]]. It is less dense than most of the other constituents of [[air]] and triggers [[convection]] currents that can lead to clouds.\n\nBeing a component of Earth's hydrosphere and hydrologic cycle, it is particularly abundant in [[Earth's atmosphere]] where it is also a potent [[greenhouse gas]] along with other gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. Use of water vapor, as [[steam]], has been important to humans for cooking and as a major component in energy production and transport systems since the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].\n\nWater vapor is a relatively common atmospheric constituent, present even in the [[solar atmosphere]] as well as every planet in the [[Solar System]] and many [[astronomical object]]s including [[natural satellite]]s, [[comet]]s and even large [[asteroid]]s. Likewise the detection of [[Extrasolar object|extrasolar]] water vapor would indicate a similar distribution in other planetary systems. Water vapor is significant in that it can be indirect evidence supporting the presence of extraterrestrial liquid water in the case of some planetary mass objects.\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Evaporation ===\nWhenever a water molecule leaves a surface and diffuses into a surrounding gas, it is said to have [[Evaporation|evaporated]]. Each individual water molecule which transitions between a more associated (liquid) and a less associated (vapor/gas) state does so through the absorption or release of [[kinetic energy]]. The aggregate measurement of this kinetic energy transfer is defined as thermal energy and occurs only when there is differential in the temperature of the water molecules. Liquid water that becomes water vapor takes a parcel of heat with it, in a process called [[evaporative cooling]].<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=36}}</ref> The amount of water vapor in the air determines how frequently molecules will return to the surface. When a net evaporation occurs, the body of water will undergo a net cooling directly related to the loss of water.\n\nIn the US, the National Weather Service measures the actual rate of evaporation from a standardized \"pan\" open water surface outdoors, at various locations nationwide. Others do likewise around the world. The US data is collected and compiled into an annual evaporation map.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId%3D208 |accessdate=April 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412215652/http://www.grow.arizona.edu/Grow--GrowResources.php?ResourceId=208 |archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}</ref> The measurements range from under 30 to over 120&nbsp;inches per year.

L. Martin & Associates}}</ref> In some countries, the evaporation rate far exceeds the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] rate.\n\nEvaporative cooling is restricted by [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|atmospheric conditions]]. [[Humidity]] is the amount of water vapor in the air. The vapor content of air is measured with devices known as [[hygrometer]]s. The measurements are usually expressed as [[specific humidity]] or percent [[relative humidity]]. The temperatures of the atmosphere and the water surface determine the equilibrium vapor pressure; 100% relative humidity occurs when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure. This condition is often referred to as complete saturation. Humidity ranges from 0&nbsp;gram per cubic metre in dry air to 30&nbsp;grams per cubic metre (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-53259/climate#292984.hook|title=climate - meteorology|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align     = right\n |width1    = 165\n |width2    = 176\n |image1    = Meteorite Recovery Antarctica (retouched).jpg\n |image2    = Tightjunction BBB.jpg\n |caption1  = Recovery of [[meteorite]]s in Antarctica ([[ANSMET]])\n |caption2  = [[Electron micrograph]] of freeze-etched [[capillary]] tissue\n}}\n\n=== Sublimation ===\n[[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] is when water molecules directly leave the surface of ice without first becoming liquid water. Sublimation accounts for the slow mid-winter disappearance of ice and snow at temperatures too low to cause melting. [[Antarctica]] shows this effect to a unique degree because it is by far the continent with the lowest rate of precipitation on Earth. As a result, there are large areas where [[Millennium|millennial]] layers of snow have sublimed, leaving behind whatever non-volatile materials they had contained. This is extremely valuable to certain scientific disciplines, a dramatic example being the collection of [[meteorite]]s that are left exposed in unparalleled numbers and excellent states of preservation.\n\nSublimation is important in the preparation of certain classes of biological specimens for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Typically the specimens are prepared by [[cryofixation]] and [[Electron microscope|freeze-fracture]], after which the broken surface is freeze-etched, being eroded by exposure to vacuum till it shows the required level of detail. This technique can display protein molecules, [[organelle]] structures and [[lipid bilayer]]s with very low degrees of distortion.\n\n=== Condensation ===\n[[File:Above the Clouds.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Clouds, formed by condensed water vapour]]\n\nWater vapour will only condense onto another surface when that surface is cooler than the [[dew point]] temperature, or when the [[saturation vapour pressure|water vapour equilibrium]] in air has been exceeded. When water vapour condenses onto a surface, a net warming occurs on that surface. The water molecule brings heat energy with it. In turn, the temperature of the atmosphere drops slightly.<ref>{{harvp|Schroeder|2000|p=19}}</ref> In the atmosphere, condensation produces clouds, fog and precipitation (usually only when facilitated by [[cloud condensation nuclei]]). The [[dew point]] of an air parcel is the temperature to which it must cool before water vapour in the air begins to condense concluding water vapour is a type of water or rain.\n\nAlso, a net condensation of water vapour occurs on surfaces when the temperature of the surface is at or below the dew point temperature of the atmosphere. [[Deposition (meteorology)|Deposition]] is a phase transition separate from condensation which leads to the direct formation of ice from water vapour. [[Frost]] and snow are examples of deposition.\n\nThere are many mechanism of cooling by which condensation occurs \n1.direct loss of heat known as radiation cooling.\n2.cooling with upliftment of air known as adiabatic cooling.\nthere are 4 types of upliftment of air:\na. orographic upliftment- mountains work as barrier for upliftment of air\nb. convectional upliftment- upliftment of air due to pressure difference \nc. frontal upliftment- upliftment of air due to temp difference\nd. cyclonic upliftment but not related to temp\n3.advective cooling- cooling due to horizontal movement of air.\n\n=== Chemical reactions ===\nA number of chemical reactions have water as a product. If the reactions take place at temperatures higher than the dew point of the surrounding air the water will be formed as vapor and increase the local humidity, if below the dew point local condensation will occur. Typical reactions that result in water formation are the burning of [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrocarbon]]s in air or other [[oxygen]] containing gas mixtures, or as a result of reactions with oxidizers.\n\nIn a similar fashion other chemical or physical reactions can take place in the presence of water vapor resulting in new chemicals forming such as [[rust]] on iron or steel, polymerization occurring (certain [[polyurethane]] foams and [[cyanoacrylate]] glues cure with exposure to atmospheric humidity) or forms changing such as where anhydrous chemicals may absorb enough vapor to form a crystalline structure or alter an existing one, sometimes resulting in characteristic color changes that can be used for [[humidity indicator card|measurement]].\n\n=== Measurement ===\nMeasuring the quantity of water vapor in a medium can be done directly or remotely with varying degrees of accuracy.

At max. saturation (i. e. rel. humidity = 100 % at 0 \u00b0C) the density will go down to 28.51 g/mol.\n* STP conditions imply a temperature of 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, at which the ability of water to become vapor is very restricted. Its [[concentration]] in air is very low at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. The red line on the chart to the right is the maximum concentration of water vapor expected for a given temperature. The water vapor concentration increases significantly as the temperature rises, approaching 100% ([[steam]], pure water vapor) at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C. However the difference in densities between air and water vapor would still exist (0.598 vs. 1.27 g/l).\n\n==== At equal temperatures ====\nAt the same temperature, a column of dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air containing any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic [[nitrogen]] and diatomic [[oxygen]] both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25&nbsp;\u00b0C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] and [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).\n\n=== Respiration and breathing ===\nWater vapor is a by-product of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its [[partial pressure]] contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other atmospheric gases [[partial pressure|(Dalton's Law)]]. The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.\n\nThis can have an effect on respiration. In very warm air (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) the proportion of water vapor is large enough to give rise to the stuffiness that can be experienced in humid jungle conditions or in poorly ventilated buildings.\n\n=== Lifting gas ===\nWater vapor has lower density than that of [[air]] and is therefore [[buoyant]] in air but has lower vapor pressure than that of air. When water vapor is used as a [[lifting gas]] by a [[thermal airship]] the water vapor is heated to form steam so that its vapor pressure is greater than the surrounding air pressure in order to maintain the shape of a theoretical \"steam balloon\", which yields approximately 60% the lift of helium and twice that of hot air.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goodey\n|first=Thomas J. |title=Steam Balloons and Steam Airships |url=http://www.flyingkettle.com/jbfa.htm |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== General discussion ===\nThe amount of water vapor in an atmosphere is constrained by the restrictions of partial pressures and temperature. Dew point temperature and relative humidity act as guidelines for the process of water vapor in the [[water cycle]]. Energy input, such as sunlight, can trigger more evaporation on an ocean surface or more sublimation on a chunk of ice on top of a mountain. The ''balance'' between condensation and evaporation gives the quantity called [[vapor pressure|vapor partial pressure]].\n\nThe maximum partial pressure (''saturation pressure'') of water vapor in air varies with temperature of the air and water vapor mixture. A variety of empirical formulas exist for this quantity; the most used reference formula is the [[Goff-Gratch equation]] for the SVP over liquid water below zero degree Celsius:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\log_{10} \\left( p \\right) =\n& -7.90298 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right) + 5.02808 \\log_{10} \\frac{373.16}{T} \\\\\n& - 1.3816 \\times 10^{-7} \\left( 10^{11.344 \\left( 1-\\frac{T}{373.16} \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + 8.1328 \\times 10^{-3} \\left( 10^{-3.49149 \\left( \\frac{373.16}{T}-1 \\right)} -1 \\right) \\\\\n& + \\log_{10} \\left( 1013.246 \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|T}}, temperature of the moist air, is given in units of [[kelvin]], and {{mvar|p}} is given in units of [[millibar]]s ([[hectopascal]]s).\n\nThe formula is valid from about \u221250 to 102&nbsp;\u00b0C; however there are a very limited number of measurements of the vapor pressure of water over supercooled liquid water. There are a number of other formulae which can be used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cires.colorado.edu/~voemel/vp.html|title=Water Vapor Pressure Formulations|publisher=|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnder certain conditions, such as when the boiling temperature of water is reached, a net evaporation will always occur during standard atmospheric conditions regardless of the percent of relative humidity. This immediate process will dispel massive amounts of water vapor into a cooler atmosphere.\n\n[[Exhalation|Exhale]]d air is almost fully at equilibrium with water vapor at the body temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or [[mist]] of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled breath is the basis of [[exhaled breath condensate]], an evolving medical diagnostic test.\n\nControlling water vapor in air is a key concern in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]] (HVAC) industry. [[Thermal comfort]] depends on the moist air conditions. Non-human comfort situations are called [[refrigeration]], and also are affected by water vapor. For example, many food stores, like supermarkets, utilize open chiller cabinets, or ''food cases'', which can significantly lower the water vapor pressure (lowering humidity). This practice delivers several benefits as well as problems.\n\n== {{anchor|Water vapor in Earth's atmosphere}} In Earth's atmosphere ==\n[[File:BAMS climate assess boulder water vapor 2002.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Evidence for increasing amounts of stratospheric water vapor over time in Boulder, Colorado.]]\n{{further|Atmosphere of Earth}}\n\nGaseous water represents a small but environmentally significant constituent of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The percentage water vapor in surface air varies from 0.01% at -42&nbsp;\u00b0C (-44&nbsp;\u00b0F)<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 34, Fig. 4.3a}}</ref> to 4.24% when the dew point is 30&nbsp;\u00b0C (86&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{harvp|McElroy|2002|loc=p. 36 example 4.1}}</ref> Approximately 99.13% of it is contained in the [[troposphere]]. The [[condensation]] of water vapor to the liquid or ice phase is responsible for [[clouds]], rain, snow, and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], all of which count among the most significant elements of what we experience as weather. Less obviously, the [[latent heat of vaporization]], which is released to the atmosphere whenever condensation occurs, is one of the most important terms in the atmospheric energy budget on both local and global scales. For example, latent heat release in atmospheric [[convection]] is directly responsible for powering destructive storms such as [[tropical cyclones]] and severe [[thunderstorms]]. Water vapor is the most potent [[greenhouse gas]] owing to the presence of the [[hydroxyl]] bond which strongly absorbs in the [[infra-red]] region of the [[light spectrum]].\n\nWater vapor is the \"working medium\" of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine which transforms heat energy from sun irradiation into mechanical energy in the form of winds. Transforming thermal energy into mechanical energy requires an upper and a lower temperature level, as well as a working medium which shuttles forth and back between both. The upper temperature level is given by the soil or water surface of the earth, which absorbs the incoming sun radiation and warms up, evaporating water. The moist and warm air at the ground is lighter than its surrounding and raises up to the upper limit of the troposphere. There the water molecules radiate their thermal energy into outer space, cooling down the surrounding air. The upper atmosphere constitutes the lower temperature level of the atmospheric thermodynamic engine. The water vapor in the now cold air condenses out and falls down to the ground in the form of rain or snow. The now heavier cold and dry air sinks down to ground as well; the atmospheric thermodynamic engine thus establishes a vertical convection, which transports heat from the ground into the upper atmosphere, where the water molecules can radiate it to outer space. Due to the earth rotation and the resulting Coriolis forces, this vertical atmospheric convection is also converted into a horizontal convection, in the form of cyclones and anticyclones, which transport the water evaporated over the oceans into the interior of the continents, enabling vegetation to grow. <ref> https://web.stanford.edu/~ajlucas/The%20Atmosphere%20as%20a%20Heat%20Engine.pdf </ref>\n\nWater in Earth's atmosphere is not merely below its boiling point (100&nbsp;\u00b0C), but [[Tropopause|at altitude]] it [[Lapse rate|goes below]] its freezing point (0&nbsp;\u00b0C), due to water's [[Hydrogen bond|highly polar attraction]]. When combined with its quantity, water vapor then has a relevant [[dew point]] and [[Dew point#frost point|frost point]], unlike e. g., carbon dioxide and methane.

In the absence of nuclei, condensation will only occur at much lower temperatures. Under persistent condensation or deposition, cloud droplets or snowflakes form, which [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitate]] when they reach a critical mass.\n\nThe water content of the atmosphere as a whole is constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25&nbsp;mm deep.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The mean annual precipitation for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air \u2013 on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the [[troposphere]] is about 9 to 10 days.\n\nEpisodes of surface geothermal activity, such as volcanic eruptions and geysers, release variable amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Such eruptions may be large in human terms, and major explosive eruptions may inject exceptionally large masses of water exceptionally high into the atmosphere, but as a percentage of total atmospheric water, the role of such processes is trivial. The relative concentrations of the various gases emitted by [[volcano]]es varies considerably according to the site and according to the particular event at any one site. However, water vapor is consistently the commonest [[volcanic gas]]; as a rule, it comprises more than 60% of total emissions during a [[subaerial eruption]].<ref>{{harvp|Sigurdsson|Houghton|2000}}</ref>\n\nAtmospheric water vapor content is expressed using various measures. These include vapor pressure, [[specific humidity]], mixing ratio, dew point temperature, and [[relative humidity]].\n\n=== Radar and satellite imaging ===\n[[File:MYDAL2 M SKY WV.ogv|thumb|These maps show the average amount of water vapor in a column of atmosphere in a given month.(''click for more detail'')]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Water Vapor Mean.2005.030.jpg|thumb|[[MODIS]]/[[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] global mean atmospheric water vapor in atm-cm (centimeters of water in an atmospheric column if it condensed)]]\n\nBecause water molecules [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] [[microwave]]s and other [[radio wave]] frequencies, water in the atmosphere attenuates [[radar]] signals.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|p=23.5}}</ref> In addition, atmospheric water will [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] and [[refraction|refract]] signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.\n\nGenerally, radar signals lose strength progressively the farther they travel through the troposphere. Different frequencies attenuate at different rates, such that some components of air are opaque to some frequencies and transparent to others. Radio waves used for broadcasting and other communication experience the same effect.\n\nWater vapor reflects radar to a lesser extent than do water's other two phases. In the form of drops and ice crystals, water acts as a prism, which it does not do as an individual [[molecule]]; however, the existence of water vapor in the atmosphere causes the atmosphere to act as a giant prism.<ref>{{harvp|Skolnik|1990|pp=2.44\u20132.54}}</ref>\n\nA comparison of [[GOES-12]] satellite images shows the distribution of atmospheric water vapor relative to the oceans, clouds and continents of the Earth. Vapor surrounds the planet but is unevenly distributed. The image loop on the right shows monthly average of water vapor content with the units are given in centimeters, which is the [[precipitable water]] or equivalent amount of water that could be produced if all the water vapor in the column were to condense. The lowest amounts of water vapor (0 centimeters) appear in yellow, and the highest amounts (6 centimeters) appear in dark blue. Areas of missing data appear in shades of gray. The maps are based on data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. The most noticeable pattern in the time series is the influence of seasonal temperature changes and incoming sunlight on water vapor. In the tropics, a band of extremely humid air wobbles north and south of the equator as the seasons change. This band of humidity is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, where the easterly trade winds from each hemisphere converge and produce near-daily thunderstorms and clouds. Farther from the equator, water vapor concentrations are high in the hemisphere experiencing summer and low in the one experiencing winter. Another pattern that shows up in the time series is that water vapor amounts over land areas decrease more in winter months than adjacent ocean areas do. This is largely because air temperatures over land drop more in the winter than temperatures over the ocean. Water vapor condenses more rapidly in colder air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV|title=Water Vapor |publisher=Global Maps|accessdate=February 26, 2016|date=2018-07-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs water vapour absorbs light in the visible spectral range, its absorption can be used in spectroscopic applications (such as [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]]) to determine the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.

From [[cloud physics]], usually clouds are the real generators of static [[electric charge|charge]] as found in Earth's atmosphere. The ability of clouds to hold massive amounts of electrical energy is directly related to the amount of water vapor present in the local system.\n\nThe amount of water vapor directly controls the [[permittivity]] of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is quick and easy. During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=165\u2013171}}</ref>\n\nAfter a cloud, for instance, has started its way to becoming a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or [[electrical insulation|insulator]]) that decreases the ability of the cloud to [[electrostatic discharge|discharge]] its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more [[static electricity]], the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy.<ref>{{harvp|Shadowitz|1975|pp=172\u2013173, 182, 414\u2013416}}</ref> This energy will be released to a local oppositely charged region, in the form of lightning.

Having competed in ten consecutive contests until {{Escyr|1966}}, Denmark was absent for eleven consecutive contests from {{Escyr|1967}} to {{Escyr|1977}}. Since {{Escyr|1978}}, it has been absent from only four contests. Denmark has won the contest three times: in {{Escyr|1963}}, {{Escyr|2000}} and {{Escyr|2013}}. The Danish national selection for the contest is the [[Dansk Melodi Grand Prix]].\n\nDenmark finished third on its debut in {{escyr|1957}} with [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], before winning the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]] with the song \"[[Dansevise]]\" performed by [[Grethe & J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]]. The country returned to the top three 25 years later, with third-place finishes for [[Hot Eyes]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]] and [[Birthe Kj\u00e6r]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]], while Denmark's only top five result of the 1990s was [[Aud Wilken]]'s fifth place in {{escyr|1995}}.\n\nDenmark won the contest for the second time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] with the [[Olsen Brothers]] and the song \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". Denmark then finished second as hosts in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]] with \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\" performed by [[Rollo & King]], before [[Malene Mortensen]] became the first Danish entry to finish last in {{escyr|2002}}. Denmark won the contest for the third time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], with [[Only Teardrops]] performed by [[Emmelie de Forest]]. Denmark has placed in the top five 14 times.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Denmark's debut ===\nDenmark first participated at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]], held in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. The country had intended to compete at the first contest in 1956, but had submitted its application past the deadline and was, therefore, not allowed to compete. Denmark was the first [[Nordic country]] to take part in the contest, with [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] following soon after. [[Iceland]], however, did not take part until 1986.\n\nDenmark's first participants were [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], who sang the song \"[[Skibet skal sejle i nat]]\" ({{lang-en|The Ship Will Be Leaving Tonight}}). Their performance was controversial as, at the end of the song, the couple performed an 11-second kiss, which caused outcry in some countries. Nevertheless, the performance achieved third place.\n\n=== First victory ===\nDenmark won the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], when [[Grethe Ingmann|Grethe]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]] sang \"[[Dansevise]]\" (Dance Ballad). The victory, however, was controversial. When Norway announced its votes, the presenter [[Katie Boyle]] could not hear the spokesperson and said that she would call them again later. Viewers around Europe, however, did hear the Norwegian spokesperson, and when Boyle called the Norwegian spokesperson again, the votes had been changed, changing the outcome of the contest and giving the victory to Denmark at the expense of [[Switzerland]]. In fact, the reason why Norway had to announce its votes again was that the Norwegian spokesperson did not follow the right procedure the first time and, therefore, there was doubt whether he gave the correct votes on the first occasion.\n\nThe final result was valid and the victory went to Denmark. Accordingly, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], the contest was held in Denmark for the first time.\n\n=== Absence and return ===\nAfter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] and a record low 14th place, Denmark withdrew from the contest, as DR\u00b4s new head of entertainment Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaiser did not view the contest as being quality entertainment. Dansk Melodi Grand Prix was not held from that year onwards.\n\nHowever, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 contest]], after 11 years' absence, and following Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaisers departure from DR, Denmark returned to the contest, represented by [[Mabel (band)|Mabel]] and the song \"[[Boom Boom (Mabel song)|Boom Boom]]\".\n\n=== Success ===\nDenmark's most successful time at the contest came between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]], with the country reaching the top eight in six out of seven contests, including four top-five placings. The duo of [[Hot Eyes]] represented the nation three times during this period. In 1984, they sang the song \"[[Det' lige det]]\" (That's Just It) and finished fourth. In 1985, they became the first and, as of 2018 only act to represent Denmark in two consecutive years. Singing \"[[Sku' du sp\u00f8rg' fra no'en?]]\" (What Business Is It Of Yours?), they could not repeat their success of the previous year and came 11th. In 1988, Hot Eyes represented Denmark again with \"[[Ka' du se hva' jeg sa'?]]\" (Didn't I Tell You So?). The duo scored its best result to date, finishing in third place, losing only to [[Celine Dion]] and [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]]. Denmark's other good results during this time were sixth place for [[Lise Haavik]] in 1986, fifth for [[Anne-Cathrine Herdorf]] & Bandjo in 1987, third for [[Birthe Kjaer]] in 1989 and eighth for [[Lonnie Devantier]] in 1990.\n\n=== Denmark's fall ===\nAfter 1990, Denmark fell from its high positions of the 1980s and was relegated from the contest on three occasions in the 1990s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], [[Tommy Seebach]], who had previously represented Denmark in 1979 and 1981, finished 22nd, resulting Denmark being relegated from the contest in 1994. [[Aud Wilken]] sang \"[[Fra Mols til Skagen]]\" for the nation at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] and came 5th, but this high placing could not be repeated in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]], as Denmark's entry, \"Kun med dig\" sung by Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, did not qualify from the pre-qualifying round of the contest. In 1998, Denmark was once again relegated from the contest following a poor result in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]].\n\n=== Return to success in the 2000s ===\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]], the abolition of the language rule, which had required all countries to sing in their official languages, brought a return to success for Denmark, when [[Michael Teschl]] and [[Trine Jepsen]] finished 8th with \"[[This Time I Mean It]]\".\n\nA year later, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], Denmark would go on to win the contest again, with brothers [[Olsen Brothers|J\u00f8rgen and Niels Olsen]] defying the odds (they were considerably older than their competitors and only one male duo had won before), to win with \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". The song went on to enjoy huge success around Europe.\n\nAt the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]], held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Rollo & King]] came second with the song \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\". However, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]], despite being a favourite to win the contest, [[Malene Mortensen]] came 24th (last) with \"[[Tell Me Who You Are (Malene song)|Tell Me Who You Are]]\", giving Denmark its worst result ever. Therefore, Denmark was relegated from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]].\n\nIn 2005, [[Copenhagen]] hosted [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]], an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary.\n\nSince the introduction of semifinals in 2004, Denmark has qualified for the final on eleven out of 15 occasions. Another string of successful participations started in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]], when Denmark reached the top five for the first time in nine years, finishing fourth with \"In a Moment Like This\" performed by Chan\u00e9e and n'evergreen. A year later, Denmark finished fifth with \"New Tomorrow\" performed by the band A Friend In London, and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], Denmark won the contest for the third time, when [[Emmelie de Forest]] represented the country with the song \"[[Only Teardrops]]\", winning with Denmark's highest-ever score of 281 points.\n\nIn 2014, Denmark reached the top ten for the fourth time in five years, when [[Basim (singer)|Basim]] finished ninth. However, the success did not continue into 2015 and 2016, as Denmark failed to qualify for the grand finals in those years. In 2017, the country returned to the final, finishing 20th with Anja Nissen. Denmark achieved its fifth top ten result of the decade in 2018, with [[Rasmussen (singer)|Rasmussen]] and the song \"[[Higher Ground (Rasmussen song)|Higher Ground]]\" finishing ninth. A year later [[Leonora (singer)|Leonora]] took Denmark to their 12th final again with the song [[Love Is Forever (Leonora song)|Love Is Forever]] and finished 12th in the final with 120 points, after finishing only 1 point away from a non- qualification in the second semi- final.\n\n==Contestants==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|style=\"background:#87A96B\"|{{center|{{small|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"#C96\"\n!{{Escyr|1957}}\n|[[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]]\n|[[Danish language|Danish]]\n|\"[[Skibet skal sejle i nat]]\"\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|10\n|rowspan=\"10\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1958}}\n|[[Raquel Rastenni]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Jeg rev et blad ud af min dagbog]]\"\n|align=center|8\n|align=center|3\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1959}}\n|[[Birthe Wilke]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Uh, jeg ville \u00f8nske jeg var dig]]\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|12\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1960}}\n|[[Katy B\u00f8dtger]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Det var en yndig tid]]\"\n|align=center|10\n|align=center|4\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1961}}\n|[[Dario Campeotto]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Angelique (song)|Angelique]]\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|12\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1962}}\n|[[Ellen Winther]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Vuggevise]]\"\n|align=center|10 \n|align=center|2\n|-bgcolor=\"gold\"\n!{{Escyr|1963}}\n|[[Grethe Ingmann|Grethe]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Dansevise]]\"\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|42 \n|-\n!{{Escyr|1964}}\n|[[Bj\u00f8rn Tidmand]] \n|Danish\n|\"[[Sangen om dig]]\"\n|align=center|9 \n|align=center|4\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1965}}\n|[[Birgit Br\u00fcel]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[For din skyld]]\"\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|10\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1966}}\n|[[Ulla Pia]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Stop -

Having competed in ten consecutive contests until {{Escyr|1966}}, Denmark was absent for eleven consecutive contests from {{Escyr|1967}} to {{Escyr|1977}}. Since {{Escyr|1978}}, it has been absent from only four contests. Denmark has won the contest three times: in {{Escyr|1963}}, {{Escyr|2000}} and {{Escyr|2013}}. The Danish national selection for the contest is the [[Dansk Melodi Grand Prix]].\n\nDenmark finished third on its debut in {{escyr|1957}} with [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], before winning the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]] with the song \"[[Dansevise]]\" performed by [[Grethe & J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]]. The country returned to the top three 25 years later, with third-place finishes for [[Hot Eyes]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]] and [[Birthe Kj\u00e6r]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]], while Denmark's only top five result of the 1990s was [[Aud Wilken]]'s fifth place in {{escyr|1995}}.\n\nDenmark won the contest for the second time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] with the [[Olsen Brothers]] and the song \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". Denmark then finished second as hosts in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]] with \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\" performed by [[Rollo & King]], before [[Malene Mortensen]] became the first Danish entry to finish last in {{escyr|2002}}. Denmark won the contest for the third time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], with [[Only Teardrops]] performed by [[Emmelie de Forest]]. Denmark has placed in the top five 14 times.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Denmark's debut ===\nDenmark first participated at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]], held in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]. The country had intended to compete at the first contest in 1956, but had submitted its application past the deadline and was, therefore, not allowed to compete. Denmark was the first [[Nordic country]] to take part in the contest, with [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] following soon after. [[Iceland]], however, did not take part until 1986.\n\nDenmark's first participants were [[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]], who sang the song \"[[Skibet skal sejle i nat]]\" ({{lang-en|The Ship Will Be Leaving Tonight}}). Their performance was controversial as, at the end of the song, the couple performed an 11-second kiss, which caused outcry in some countries. Nevertheless, the performance achieved third place.\n\n=== First victory ===\nDenmark won the contest for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], when [[Grethe Ingmann|Grethe]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]] sang \"[[Dansevise]]\" (Dance Ballad). The victory, however, was controversial. When Norway announced its votes, the presenter [[Katie Boyle]] could not hear the spokesperson and said that she would call them again later. Viewers around Europe, however, did hear the Norwegian spokesperson, and when Boyle called the Norwegian spokesperson again, the votes had been changed, changing the outcome of the contest and giving the victory to Denmark at the expense of [[Switzerland]]. In fact, the reason why Norway had to announce its votes again was that the Norwegian spokesperson did not follow the right procedure the first time and, therefore, there was doubt whether he gave the correct votes on the first occasion.\n\nThe final result was valid and the victory went to Denmark. Accordingly, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964]], the contest was held in Denmark for the first time.\n\n=== Absence and return ===\nAfter the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1966|1966 contest]] and a record low 14th place, Denmark withdrew from the contest, as DR\u00b4s new head of entertainment Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaiser did not view the contest as being quality entertainment. Dansk Melodi Grand Prix was not held from that year onwards.\n\nHowever, in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978 contest]], after 11 years' absence, and following Niels J\u00f8rgen Kaisers departure from DR, Denmark returned to the contest, represented by [[Mabel (band)|Mabel]] and the song \"[[Boom Boom (Mabel song)|Boom Boom]]\".\n\n=== Success ===\nDenmark's most successful time at the contest came between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1990|1990]], with the country reaching the top eight in six out of seven contests, including four top-five placings. The duo of [[Hot Eyes]] represented the nation three times during this period. In 1984, they sang the song \"[[Det' lige det]]\" (That's Just It) and finished fourth. In 1985, they became the first and, as of 2018 only act to represent Denmark in two consecutive years. Singing \"[[Sku' du sp\u00f8rg' fra no'en?]]\" (What Business Is It Of Yours?), they could not repeat their success of the previous year and came 11th. In 1988, Hot Eyes represented Denmark again with \"[[Ka' du se hva' jeg sa'?]]\" (Didn't I Tell You So?). The duo scored its best result to date, finishing in third place, losing only to [[Celine Dion]] and [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]]. Denmark's other good results during this time were sixth place for [[Lise Haavik]] in 1986, fifth for [[Anne-Cathrine Herdorf]] & Bandjo in 1987, third for [[Birthe Kjaer]] in 1989 and eighth for [[Lonnie Devantier]] in 1990.\n\n=== Denmark's fall ===\nAfter 1990, Denmark fell from its high positions of the 1980s and was relegated from the contest on three occasions in the 1990s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], [[Tommy Seebach]], who had previously represented Denmark in 1979 and 1981, finished 22nd, resulting Denmark being relegated from the contest in 1994. [[Aud Wilken]] sang \"[[Fra Mols til Skagen]]\" for the nation at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] and came 5th, but this high placing could not be repeated in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]], as Denmark's entry, \"Kun med dig\" sung by Dorthe Andersen and Martin Loft, did not qualify from the pre-qualifying round of the contest. In 1998, Denmark was once again relegated from the contest following a poor result in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]].\n\n=== Return to success in the 2000s ===\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]], the abolition of the language rule, which had required all countries to sing in their official languages, brought a return to success for Denmark, when [[Michael Teschl]] and [[Trine Jepsen]] finished 8th with \"[[This Time I Mean It]]\".\n\nA year later, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], Denmark would go on to win the contest again, with brothers [[Olsen Brothers|J\u00f8rgen and Niels Olsen]] defying the odds (they were considerably older than their competitors and only one male duo had won before), to win with \"[[Fly on the Wings of Love]]\". The song went on to enjoy huge success around Europe.\n\nAt the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001 contest]], held in [[Copenhagen]], [[Rollo & King]] came second with the song \"[[Never Ever Let You Go]]\". However, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002]], despite being a favourite to win the contest, [[Malene Mortensen]] came 24th (last) with \"[[Tell Me Who You Are (Malene song)|Tell Me Who You Are]]\", giving Denmark its worst result ever. Therefore, Denmark was relegated from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003 contest]].\n\nIn 2005, [[Copenhagen]] hosted [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]], an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary.\n\nSince the introduction of semifinals in 2004, Denmark has qualified for the final on eleven out of 15 occasions. Another string of successful participations started in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]], when Denmark reached the top five for the first time in nine years, finishing fourth with \"In a Moment Like This\" performed by Chan\u00e9e and n'evergreen. A year later, Denmark finished fifth with \"New Tomorrow\" performed by the band A Friend In London, and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], Denmark won the contest for the third time, when [[Emmelie de Forest]] represented the country with the song \"[[Only Teardrops]]\", winning with Denmark's highest-ever score of 281 points.\n\nIn 2014, Denmark reached the top ten for the fourth time in five years, when [[Basim (singer)|Basim]] finished ninth. However, the success did not continue into 2015 and 2016, as Denmark failed to qualify for the grand finals in those years. In 2017, the country returned to the final, finishing 20th with Anja Nissen. Denmark achieved its fifth top ten result of the decade in 2018, with [[Rasmussen (singer)|Rasmussen]] and the song \"[[Higher Ground (Rasmussen song)|Higher Ground]]\" finishing ninth. A year later [[Leonora (singer)|Leonora]] took Denmark to their 12th final again with the song [[Love Is Forever (Leonora song)|Love Is Forever]] and finished 12th in the final with 120 points, after finishing only 1 point away from a non- qualification in the second semi- final.\n\n==Contestants==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|style=\"background:#87A96B\"|{{center|{{small|{{Abbr|W.|Withdrew}}}}}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"#C96\"\n!{{Escyr|1957}}\n|[[Birthe Wilke]] and [[Gustav Winckler]]\n|[[Danish language|Danish]]\n|\"[[Skibet skal sejle i nat]]\"\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|10\n|rowspan=\"10\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1958}}\n|[[Raquel Rastenni]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Jeg rev et blad ud af min dagbog]]\"\n|align=center|8\n|align=center|3\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1959}}\n|[[Birthe Wilke]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Uh, jeg ville \u00f8nske jeg var dig]]\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|12\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1960}}\n|[[Katy B\u00f8dtger]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Det var en yndig tid]]\"\n|align=center|10\n|align=center|4\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1961}}\n|[[Dario Campeotto]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Angelique (song)|Angelique]]\"\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|12\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1962}}\n|[[Ellen Winther]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Vuggevise]]\"\n|align=center|10 \n|align=center|2\n|-bgcolor=\"gold\"\n!{{Escyr|1963}}\n|[[Grethe Ingmann|Grethe]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Ingmann]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Dansevise]]\"\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|42 \n|-\n!{{Escyr|1964}}\n|[[Bj\u00f8rn Tidmand]] \n|Danish\n|\"[[Sangen om dig]]\"\n|align=center|9 \n|align=center|4\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1965}}\n|[[Birgit Br\u00fcel]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[For din skyld]]\"\n|align=center|7 \n|align=center|10\n|-\n!{{Escyr|1966}}\n|[[Ulla Pia]]\n|Danish\n|\"[[Stop -

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

Keenan]], the chief prosecutor in the Tokyo Trials, says that the attack on Pearl Harbor not only happened without a declaration of war but was also a [[Betrayal|treacherous]] and [[deceitful]] act. In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace. When a nation employs a deceit and treachery, using periods of negotiations and the negotiations themselves as a cloak to screen a [[perfidy|perfidious]] attack, then there is a prime example of the crime of all crimes.<ref>Keenan, Joseph Berry and Brown, Brendan Francis, ''Crimes against International Law'', Public Affairs Press, Washington, 1950, pp.&nbsp;57\u201387</ref><ref>''Tokyo Transcript'', May 13, 1946, p.491</ref>}}\n\nAdmiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, was fully aware that if Japan lost the war, he would be tried as a war criminal for that attack {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} (although he was killed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[Operation Vengeance]] in 1943).

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

According to the [[Hague Convention of 1907]] (the only convention which Japan had ratified regarding the treatment of prisoners of war), any military personnel captured on land or at sea by enemy troops were to be treated as prisoners of war and not punished for simply being lawful combatants. Eight Doolittle Raiders captured upon landing in China (four months before the passage of the Act) were the first Allied aircrew to be brought before a [[kangaroo court]] in Shanghai under the act, charged with alleged (but unproven) strafing of Japanese civilians during the Doolittle Raid. The eight aircrew were forbidden to give any defense and, despite the lack of legitimate evidences, were found guilty of participating in aerial military operations against Japan. Five of the eight sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; the other three airmen were taken to a cemetery outside Shanghai, where they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on October 14, 1942.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Doolittle Raid 1942: America's first strike back at Japan (Campaign) |author=Clayton Chun |date=January 31, 2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 85] |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=1-84176-918-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II: The Myths and the Facts |author=Stewart Halsey Ross |date=December 13, 2002 |page=59 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-7864-1412-X}}</ref>\n\nThe Enemy Airmen's Act contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Allied airmen throughout the Pacific War.

In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters&nbsp;...

The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and \"prevention of honorable burial\".

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

After the patrol saw a [[white flag]] displayed on the west bank of [[Matanikau River]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Frank Goettge]] assembled 25 men, primarily consisting of [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] personnel, to search the area. Unknown to the patrol, the white flag was actually a [[Japanese flag]] with the ''[[Hinomaru]]'' disc insignia obscured. A Japanese prisoner earlier deliberately tricked the Marines into an ambush by telling them that there were a number of Japanese west of the Matanikau River who wanted to surrender.<ref name=\"EARNED\">{{cite book |title=Earned in Blood: My Journey from Old-Breed Marine to the Most Dangerous Job in America |date=May 21, 2013 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earnedinbloodmyj0000mill/page/80 80] |author=Thurman Miller |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=1-250-00499-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/earnedinbloodmyj0000mill/page/80 }}</ref> The Goettge Patrol landed by boat west of the [[Lunga Point]] perimeter, between [[Point Cruz]] and the Matanikau River, on a [[reconnaissance]] mission to contact a group of Japanese troops that American forces believed might be willing to surrender. Soon after the patrol landed, a group of Japanese naval troops ambushed and almost completely wiped out the patrol. Goettge was among the dead. Only three Americans made it back to American lines in the Lunga Point perimeter alive. News of the killing and treachery by the Japanese outraged the American Marines:\n{{quote|This was the first mass killing of the Marines on Guadalcanal. We were shocked.

Two Marines of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] told cautionary tales. One confided: \"They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people.

The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]\nSoon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These numbers included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Koreans.<ref>Dower, John (2000). ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', p. 447</ref> The Class-A charges were all tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as \"the Tokyo Trials\". Other courts were formed in many different places in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Tokyo Trials===\n{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.\n\nHigh-ranking officers who were tried included [[K\u014dichi Kido]] and [[Sadao Araki]]. Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.\n* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir\u014d Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].\n* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'', 2000, p.583, 584</ref> Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, \"with the full support of [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]]'s headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor\"<ref>Dower,''Embracing defeat'', 1999, p.326</ref> and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime \"cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of the [[Cold War]], release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]].\"<ref>Dower, ''Hirohito'', p.562.</ref> For Herbert Bix, \"MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.\"<ref>Bix, ''Hirohito'', p.585, 583</ref>\n\n===Other trials===\n{{Main|Khabarovsk War Crime Trials|Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal}}\n\n[[File:AWM 121782 sandakan.jpg|thumb|26 October 1945, [[Sandakan]], [[North Borneo]].

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]].

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million. Of these, I would suggest that between 6-million and 8-million were ethnic Chinese, regardless of where they were resident.<ref name=sterling/>}}\n\nAccording to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' pp&nbsp;2\u20133</ref> The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher because\u2014under a directive ratified on August 5, 1937, by Emperor [[Hirohito]]\u2014the constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.<ref>Akira Fujiwara, ''Nitch\u00fb Sens\u00f4 ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu'', Kikan Sens\u00f4 Sekinin Kenky\u00fb 9, 1995, p. 22</ref> Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the [[surrender of Japan]].<ref>Tanaka, ibid., Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p. 360</ref> After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491548/Alive-safe-brutal-Japanese-soldiers-butchered-20-000-Allied-seamen-cold-blood.html|author=Blundell, Nigel|title=Alive and safe, the brutal Japanese soldiers who butchered 20,000 Allied seamen in cold blood|publisher=Mail Online (Associated Newspapers Ltd.)|date=November 3, 2007|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Attacks on neutral powers===\n[[File:The USS Arizona (BB-39) burning after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor - NARA 195617 - Edit.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Arizona (BB-39)]] burning during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]\nArticle 1 of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''III \u2013 The Opening of Hostilities'' prohibited the initiation of hostilities against neutral powers \"without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned [[declaration of war]] or of an [[ultimatum]] with conditional declaration of war\" and Article 2 further stated that \"[t]he existence of a state of war must be notified to the neutral Powers without delay, and shall not take effect in regard to them until after the receipt of a notification, which may, however, be given by telegraph.\" Japanese diplomats intended to deliver the notice to the United States thirty minutes before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, but it was delivered to the U.S. government an hour after the attack was over.

In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace.

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

During the 1990s, the [[South Korea]]n government started investigating some people who had allegedly become wealthy while collaborating with the Japanese military.<ref>[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004181952/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=23332&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\">[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004182014/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=2202&categoryCode=117 |date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref> In South Korea, it is also alleged that, during the political climate of the [[Cold War]], many such people or their associates or relatives were able to acquire influence with the wealth they had acquired collaborating with the Japanese and assisted in the covering-up, or non-investigation, of war crimes in order not to incriminate themselves. With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749467.stm |title=World &#124; Asia-Pacific &#124; Korean WWII sex slaves fight on |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1846 |title=''Ex-sex slave narrates: \"Japan Boiled Comfort Woman to Make Soup\".

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.

Just three km from the Port of Limay, the Arsenal is strategically situated near the [[Petron Corporation|Petron]] Bataan Refinery, the Bataan Combined Cycle Power Plant, the [[National Power Corporation]] Plant, the Petro-Chemical Complex, and the [[Freeport Area of Bataan|Freeport Area]] at [[Mariveles, Bataan]]. To sustain its operations, the GA presently maintains and operates 124 buildings and structures sprawled over 70 hectares of land.\n\nA creation of [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 1884 which was signed into law on June 22, 1957, the Arsenal is a line bureau under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]]. However, it was only about a decade later, on March 7, 1967, that a presidential proclamation on its present site at [[Limay, Bataan]] was declared. Accordingly, on October 12, 1967, the ground breaking materialized at the spot where the statue of [[Antonio Luna|General Antonio Luna]] now stands. Site preparations were subsequently undertaken by the 514th and 564th Engineering Construction Battalions of the 51st Engineering Brigade of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Construction of essential buildings and facilities then followed along with training abroad of selected military and newly hired civilian personnel on the manufacture of small arms ammunition (SAA).\n\nOn August 15, 1971, or fourteen (14) years after the enactment of Republic Act 1884, the first SAA cartridge rolled out of the GA's production assembly line. Three years later, the integrated SAA manufacture began, with all the components - case, primer, propellant powder, and bullet assembled into a complete cartridge - manufactured in the arsenal.\n\nAs a strategic resource, the arsenal is envisioned to be a center for defense industries to meet domestic requirements and supply the world market. In line with this vision, the GA explored in the early 1980s, the possibility of exporting excess production, improving ammunition technology and expanding the capability for weapons production as called for in its charter. However, the impediments under the then existing laws prevented any real progress in this direction.\n\n==Modernization==\n[[File:GA Marine Scout Sniper Rifle Variant 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|GA-made [[Marine Scout Sniper Rifle|Marine Scout Sniper Rifles]] on display.]]\n\nOn February 23, 1995, Republic Act 7898, otherwise known as the [[AFP Modernization Act]], was enacted. Republic Act 7898 likewise provides for the modernization of the Government Arsenal for the development of production capabilities to enhance self-sufficiency in defense requirements. Specifically, Section 12 of this Act mandates that \"the government arsenal shall be utilized in the production of basic weapons, ammunition and other munitions for the use of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP), and for the sale and export of products in excess of AFP/PNP requirements.\" Furthermore, the GA is authorized to use such production facilities as it may own or be provided under the law or as it may arrange under joint venture, co-production or similar arrangements with local and foreign entities.\n\nAs part of the modernization effort, the arsenal, through the Department of National Defense, issued an invitation to bid for a Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 in August 2009.<ref name=\"bid\">{{cite web |title=Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB): Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 |url=http://www.dnd.gov.ph/DNDWEBPAGE_files/dndbac/ITB/ITEABSep09/ITAEB%20GA.pdf |publisher=Department of National Defense |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This marks a significant expansion of existing production lines.\n\nAs of the most recent supplemental bulletin for the bid,<ref name=\"supp\">{{cite web |title=Supplemental bid bulletin Nr.

The Arsenal shall likewise continuously conduct research and development activities in accordance with the spirit of Self-Reliant Defense Posture (SRDP) Program of the government in order to gain insights and finally develop technical capability in the manufacture of weapons that are vital to support the mission of the AFP, PNP and other law enforcement agencies.''\n\n* '''Phase III - Establishment of Various Munitions Testing Facilities'''\nProjected budget: Five Hundred Million Pesos (P500M)\n\n''The Arsenal shall be transformed from its present status as a mere small arms ammunition manufacturer into a multi-task-capable agency by establishing various facilities with necessary equipment and appropriate technology to hone and harness its technical know-how in the conduct of tests and evaluation of an assortment of defense material.''\n\n* '''Phase IV -

Specifically, Section 12 of this Act mandates that \"the government arsenal shall be utilized in the production of basic weapons, ammunition and other munitions for the use of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP), and for the sale and export of products in excess of AFP/PNP requirements.\" Furthermore, the GA is authorized to use such production facilities as it may own or be provided under the law or as it may arrange under joint venture, co-production or similar arrangements with local and foreign entities.\n\nAs part of the modernization effort, the arsenal, through the Department of National Defense, issued an invitation to bid for a Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 in August 2009.<ref name=\"bid\">{{cite web |title=Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (IAEB): Multi-Station Bullet Assembly Machine for 5.56mm M193/M855 |url=http://www.dnd.gov.ph/DNDWEBPAGE_files/dndbac/ITB/ITEABSep09/ITAEB%20GA.pdf |publisher=Department of National Defense |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2009-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  This marks a significant expansion of existing production lines.\n\nAs of the most recent supplemental bulletin for the bid,<ref name=\"supp\">{{cite web |title=Supplemental bid bulletin Nr.

They are best known for their song \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (song)|My Own Worst Enemy]]\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lit-mn0000837886/biography|title=Lit - Biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|work=AllMusic|accessdate= March 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Lit (1986\u20131995)===\nJeremy Popoff and bassist Kevin Baldes met in 1986, and soon after, began playing music together. In 1987, Jeremy Popoff and Jerry Neel formed the band Strate Lace and performed three live shows together: The Troubador in Hollywood, The Waters Club in San Pedro, and a back-to-school party in a friend's back yard. Neel quit the band to pursue a career in the mortgage industry.\n\nLater on, high school friends Baldes (15 or 16 at the time) and Popoff's brother Ajay (14 at the time) formed the pop metal band Razzle in 1988 with Sean Holland. The lineup included Kevin Baldes (bass, vocals), Ajay Popoff (drums, percussion), Sean Holland (guitar), and Charles Ward (vocals). They performed their first show on June 26, 1988, at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]]. In 1989, Ajay switched from drums to lead vocals, and the band added guitarist Jeremy Popoff and drummer [[Allen Shellenberger]]. Things began to come together in 1990, when the group released a demo tape and an EP entitled ''New Vibe Revolution'' in 1993.  Razzle dissolved in 1993 and became Stain in 1994, which had a much harder and heavier sound. They released a demo tape in 1995 and eventually signed with Malicious Vinyl in 1995. After finding out the name \"Stain\" was already owned, the band changed their name to Lit.\n\n===''Tripping the Light Fantastic'' (1996\u20131997)===\nOn April 1, 1997 the group released ''[[Tripping the Light Fantastic (album)|Tripping the Light Fantastic]]'' on the Malicious Vinyl [[record label]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Malicious Vinyl went out of business shortly after ''Tripping the Light Fantastic'' was released, which left the band unsigned once again. They spent their time writing a new batch of songs and showcasing for various record labels until they signed with [[RCA Records]] in 1998.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===The RCA years (1998\u20132002)===\nThe group gained popularity with their second album ''[[A Place in the Sun (Lit album)|A Place in the Sun]]'', released in February 1999. ''A Place in the Sun'' yielded the [[hit single]], \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (Lit song)|My Own Worst Enemy]],\" which peaked at number 51 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], topping the [[Modern Rock Tracks|Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for a total of 12 weeks, and receiving a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Music Award for the biggest modern rock song of 1999. It was followed by \"[[Zip-Lock (song)|Zip-Lock]]\" (which featured [[Blink-182]] in the [[music video|video]]) and \"[[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]\", the latter of which was among the top ten most played songs of 2000 and featured [[Pamela Anderson]] in the video, as a [[giantess]] who lets the band walk on different parts her body before eventually betraying and [[Vorarephilia|devouring]] them all. Shortly after, the album went [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the US and [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in Canada, becoming the band's best selling album. The band performed over 286 shows and toured worldwide in support of ''A Place in the Sun''. In addition to the [[Vans Warped Tour]] and a slot on [[Woodstock 1999]], the band toured with [[The Offspring]], [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], and [[No Doubt]]. The band's tracks also appeared in soundtracks of ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'' and ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]''.\n\nLit followed up ''A Place in the Sun'' with the 2001 release of ''[[Atomic (Lit album)|Atomic]]''. The new album steered away from the sound of their last [[pop punk]] album, resulting in a more mature yet ultimately less successful format. The band's highest charting single was \"[[Lipstick and Bruises]]\" which reached [[Top 40|Top 10]] on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks]]. Lit toured to support ''Atomic'' with [[Kid Rock]] and [[Butch Walker]]. The group was released from their contract with RCA Records in late 2002.\n\n===Self-titled album (2003\u20132007)===\nLit went on a small, intimate club tour in the fall of 2003 before releasing the self-titled ''Lit'' on the [[DRT Entertainment]] label on June 24, 2004. The single \"Looks Like They Were Right\" made it on the Top 40 charts. That year the group also put out its first long-form [[DVD]], ''All Access'', on November 16, 2004.\n\n===Death of Allen Shellenberger===\n\nOn May 5, 2008, Lit announced that their drummer Allen Shellenberger was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Shellenberger immediately underwent clinical trials, chemotherapy and radiation at the Cedars-Sinai Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute. It was discovered that the tumor was [[malignant glioma]] and was incurable. His treatments were documented in a piece on [[ABC World News Tonight]] that aired in the same month. Lit cancelled their scheduled tour dates with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] due to Shellenberger's diagnosis. On July 26, 2008, Lit held a benefit concert for Allen at the [[House Of Blues]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. A number of bands performed including [[Sugar Ray]] and [[Handsome Devil (band)|Handsome Devil]]. [[No Doubt]] drummer [[Adrian Young]] filled in for Shellenberger for a couple of songs. Both drummers also played at the same time for a few songs. The concert was Allen's last show with Lit, as he died at the age of 39 from his tumor on August 13, 2009.<ref name=\"consequenceofsound.net\">{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2009/08/14/lit-drummer-allen-shellenberger-dead-at-39/|title=Lit drummer Allen Shellenberger dead at 39|accessdate=August 14, 2009|publisher=Consequenceofsound.net}}</ref>\n\n===''The View from the Bottom'' (2009\u20132015)===\nOn November 23, 2009, Lit played their first concert since Allen Shellenberger's death.

They are best known for their song \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (song)|My Own Worst Enemy]]\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lit-mn0000837886/biography|title=Lit - Biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|work=AllMusic|accessdate= March 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Lit (1986\u20131995)===\nJeremy Popoff and bassist Kevin Baldes met in 1986, and soon after, began playing music together. In 1987, Jeremy Popoff and Jerry Neel formed the band Strate Lace and performed three live shows together: The Troubador in Hollywood, The Waters Club in San Pedro, and a back-to-school party in a friend's back yard. Neel quit the band to pursue a career in the mortgage industry.\n\nLater on, high school friends Baldes (15 or 16 at the time) and Popoff's brother A. Jay (14 at the time) formed the pop metal band Razzle in 1988 with Sean Holland. The lineup included Kevin Baldes (bass, vocals), A. Jay Popoff (drums, percussion), Sean Holland (guitar), and Charles Ward (vocals). They performed their first show on June 26, 1988, at [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]]. In 1989, A. Jay switched from drums to lead vocals, and the band added guitarist Jeremy Popoff and drummer [[Allen Shellenberger]]. Things began to come together in 1990, when the group released a demo tape and an EP entitled ''New Vibe Revolution'' in 1993.  Razzle dissolved in 1993 and became Stain in 1994, which had a much harder and heavier sound. They released a demo tape in 1995 and eventually signed with Malicious Vinyl in 1995. After finding out the name \"Stain\" was already owned, the band changed their name to Lit.\n\n===''Tripping the Light Fantastic'' (1996\u20131997)===\nOn April 1, 1997 the group released ''[[Tripping the Light Fantastic (album)|Tripping the Light Fantastic]]'' on the Malicious Vinyl [[record label]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Malicious Vinyl went out of business shortly after ''Tripping the Light Fantastic'' was released, which left the band unsigned once again. They spent their time writing a new batch of songs and showcasing for various record labels until they signed with [[RCA Records]] in 1998.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===The RCA years (1998\u20132002)===\nThe group gained popularity with their second album ''[[A Place in the Sun (Lit album)|A Place in the Sun]]'', released in February 1999. ''A Place in the Sun'' yielded the [[hit single]], \"[[My Own Worst Enemy (Lit song)|My Own Worst Enemy]],\" which peaked at number 51 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], topping the [[Modern Rock Tracks|Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks]] chart for a total of 12 weeks, and receiving a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Music Award for the biggest modern rock song of 1999. It was followed by \"[[Zip-Lock (song)|Zip-Lock]]\" (which featured [[Blink-182]] in the [[music video|video]]) and \"[[Miserable (song)|Miserable]]\", the latter of which was among the top ten most played songs of 2000 and featured [[Pamela Anderson]] in the video, as a [[giantess]] who lets the band walk on different parts her body before eventually betraying and [[Vorarephilia|devouring]] them all. Shortly after, the album went [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] in the US and [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in Canada, becoming the band's best selling album. The band performed over 286 shows and toured worldwide in support of ''A Place in the Sun''. In addition to the [[Vans Warped Tour]] and a slot on [[Woodstock 1999]], the band toured with [[The Offspring]], [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], and [[No Doubt]]. The band's tracks also appeared in soundtracks of ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'' and ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]''.\n\nLit followed up ''A Place in the Sun'' with the 2001 release of ''[[Atomic (Lit album)|Atomic]]''. The new album steered away from the sound of their last [[pop punk]] album, resulting in a more mature yet ultimately less successful format. The band's highest charting single was \"[[Lipstick and Bruises]]\" which reached [[Top 40|Top 10]] on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks]]. Lit toured to support ''Atomic'' with [[Kid Rock]] and [[Butch Walker]]. The group was released from their contract with RCA Records in late 2002.\n\n===Self-titled album (2003\u20132007)===\nLit went on a small, intimate club tour in the fall of 2003 before releasing the self-titled ''Lit'' on the [[DRT Entertainment]] label on June 24, 2004. The single \"Looks Like They Were Right\" made it on the Top 40 charts. That year the group also put out its first long-form [[DVD]], ''All Access'', on November 16, 2004.\n\n===Death of Allen Shellenberger===\n\nOn May 5, 2008, Lit announced that their drummer Allen Shellenberger was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Shellenberger immediately underwent clinical trials, chemotherapy and radiation at the Cedars-Sinai Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute. It was discovered that the tumor was [[malignant glioma]] and was incurable. His treatments were documented in a piece on [[ABC World News Tonight]] that aired in the same month. Lit cancelled their scheduled tour dates with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] due to Shellenberger's diagnosis. On July 26, 2008, Lit held a benefit concert for Allen at the [[House Of Blues]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. A number of bands performed including [[Sugar Ray]] and [[Handsome Devil (band)|Handsome Devil]]. [[No Doubt]] drummer [[Adrian Young]] filled in for Shellenberger for a couple of songs. Both drummers also played at the same time for a few songs. The concert was Allen's last show with Lit, as he died at the age of 39 from his tumor on August 13, 2009.<ref name=\"consequenceofsound.net\">{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2009/08/14/lit-drummer-allen-shellenberger-dead-at-39/|title=Lit drummer Allen Shellenberger dead at 39|accessdate=August 14, 2009|publisher=Consequenceofsound.net}}</ref>\n\n===''The View from the Bottom'' (2009\u20132015)===\nOn November 23, 2009, Lit played their first concert since Allen Shellenberger's death.

She is also known for using local, non-professional actors in her films.<ref name=VanityFair-LeaveNoTrace-2018 /><ref name=PBS-Reel13-DownToTheBone-2010 /> Granik has worked with creative partner [[Anne Rosellini]] on all of her films.<ref name=BUILDseries-LeaveNoTrace-2018 />\n\nGranik has said that she sees a common thread of press coverage describing her as having a \"comeback narrative,\"<ref name=HuffPost-LeaveNoTrace-2018 /> along with questions about how much time has elapsed between projects,<ref name=BUILDseries-LeaveNoTrace-2018 /> partly due to the relatively low output of films in her career compared to the contemporaries she started out with.<ref name=Vulture-Sundance-LeaveNoTrace-2018 /><ref name=LATimes-StrayDog-2014 />\n\nInterviewed by Jeremiah Kipp in ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]'' in 2005, Granik discussed the challenges of directing a move like ''Down to the Bone''. She gave an overview of the challenges involved in doing a film about addiction:\n:The traditional storyline in an American film is usually in the form of a V shape. I am oversimplifying, but we see someone tumbling down, they hit bottom, and then they rise up again and find redemption. Anyone who personally, tangentially or culturally knows anything about addiction is aware that it resembles an EKG. Up and down, up and down. Very few people ever get clean on the first or second attempt. For many people, it\u2019s something they have to try over and over again. You get knocked down and ask all the ethical questions like how many chances do you give a person? When is the last chance? How many chances do they get? Can you imagine how difficult it is to fit that in a feature-length film? But those are the questions that are worth asking... The reason why boils down to the word \u201cdark\u201d. It is the scariest four-letter word in American storytelling and in this culture. Our film had a strong reception in Europe and achieved distribution, but that was not the case here. We received so many responses like, \u201cWe love the film, but we cannot do anything with it or we\u2019ll lose our shirts. We\u2019re sorry.\u201d The intervention comes from people like Laemmle/Zeller Films. Every couple of years, some mavericks take on this challenge of distributing so-called un-distributable films. They take those films on a small run and allow them to see the light of day. Those efforts are what give a film like ''Down to the Bone'' a chance to have a life of some kind.<ref name=Filmmaker-CloseToTheBone-Interview-2005 />\n\nGranik's films deal with issues of personal strength and willpower, like the character of Ree Dolly in ''[[Winter's Bone]]''. She cites [[Mike Leigh]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Shane Meadows]], the [[Dardenne brothers]], [[Laurent Cantet]], and [[Abbas Kiarostami]] as some of her major influences in her directing career.<ref name=NYTimes-WintersBone-Feature-2010 />In a 2018 interview with [https://ff2media.com/thehotpinkpen/ FF2 Media] about ''Leave No Trace'', Granik discusses the themes of the film and what drew her to creating the film:<blockquote>I realized while reading it that one of the turning points in a girl\u2019s coming-of-age is coming to terms with the fact that as much as you may care about someone, you can\u2019t necessarily save them or even help them. You can be loving and tolerant, but you can\u2019t fix them. And that\u2019s something she\u2019s really struggling with in a really robust way, especially when they\u2019re in a new setting. And I really liked the fact that Tom is the one thing that\u2019s grounding him. She is his source of meaning. His sense of self-worth is bolstered by being meaningful to her, by being her dad. He takes pride in being her teacher and taking responsibility for her. And I was just so interested in the universality of that. The ties that bind is core material. There\u2019s nothing new about those themes, but I really liked that the novel had renewed my interest in exploring them.<ref>{{Cite

She gave an overview of the challenges involved in doing a film about addiction:\n:The traditional storyline in an American film is usually in the form of a V shape. I am oversimplifying, but we see someone tumbling down, they hit bottom, and then they rise up again and find redemption. Anyone who personally, tangentially or culturally knows anything about addiction is aware that it resembles an EKG. Up and down, up and down. Very few people ever get clean on the first or second attempt. For many people, it\u2019s something they have to try over and over again. You get knocked down and ask all the ethical questions like how many chances do you give a person? When is the last chance? How many chances do they get? Can you imagine how difficult it is to fit that in a feature-length film? But those are the questions that are worth asking... The reason why boils down to the word \u201cdark\u201d. It is the scariest four-letter word in American storytelling and in this culture. Our film had a strong reception in Europe and achieved distribution, but that was not the case here. We received so many responses like, \u201cWe love the film, but we cannot do anything with it or we\u2019ll lose our shirts. We\u2019re sorry.\u201d The intervention comes from people like Laemmle/Zeller Films. Every couple of years, some mavericks take on this challenge of distributing so-called un-distributable films. They take those films on a small run and allow them to see the light of day. Those efforts are what give a film like ''Down to the Bone'' a chance to have a life of some kind.<ref name=Filmmaker-CloseToTheBone-Interview-2005 />\n\nGranik's films deal with issues of personal strength and willpower, like the character of Ree Dolly in ''[[Winter's Bone]]''. She cites [[Mike Leigh]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Shane Meadows]], the [[Dardenne brothers]], [[Laurent Cantet]], and [[Abbas Kiarostami]] as some of her major influences in her directing career.<ref name=NYTimes-WintersBone-Feature-2010 />In an interview with [https://ff2media.com/thehotpinkpen/ FF2 Media] about ''Leave No Trace'', Granik discusses the themes of the film and what drew her to creating the film:<blockquote>I realized while reading it that one of the turning points in a girl\u2019s coming-of-age is coming to terms with the fact that as much as you may care about someone, you can\u2019t necessarily save them or even help them. You can be loving and tolerant, but you can\u2019t fix them. And that\u2019s something she\u2019s really struggling with in a really robust way, especially when they\u2019re in a new setting. And I really liked the fact that Tom is the one thing that\u2019s grounding him. She is his source of meaning. His sense of self-worth is bolstered by being meaningful to her, by being her dad. He takes pride in being her teacher and taking responsibility for her. And I was just so interested in the universality of that. The ties that bind is core material. There\u2019s nothing new about those themes, but I really liked that the novel had renewed my interest in exploring them.<ref>{{Cite
