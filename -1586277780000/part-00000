It aired as part of the show's [[Adventure Time (season 8)|eighth season]] on [[Cartoon Network]] from January 30, 2017, to February 2, 2017. ''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), a dog with magical powers to change shape, grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, Finn, Jake, BMO (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]) and Susan Strong (voiced by [[Jackie Buscarino]]) leave Ooo and voyage across the ocean to learn about Finn's origin. During their trip, they encounter various creatures, new friends, and several interesting islands. The trip culminates with a visit to Founder's Island, where Finn meets his biological mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by [[Sharon Horgan]]), and discovers what happened to the remainder of the human race.\n\n''Islands'' is the second ''Adventure Time'' miniseries to have been produced, following ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'', which aired in November 2015. ''Islands'' was preceded by the release of a [[graphic novel]], which tied into the story and served as a prequel. The miniseries' story was developed by head writer [[Kent Osborne]], series showrunner [[Adam Muto]], story editor  Jack Pendarvis, and staff writer [[Ashly Burch]]. Storyboard artists who worked on this miniseries include Sam Alden, Polly Guo, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, [[Tom Herpich]], [[Steve Wolfhard]], [[Graham Falk]], Pendleton Ward, Hanna K. Nystr\u00f6m, Aleks Sennwald, Kent Osborne, and Adam Muto. [[Cole Sanchez]] and Elizabeth Ito served as the miniseries' supervising directors, and Sandra Lee served as art director.\n\n''Islands'' was met with positive reviews, with many critics applauding how the miniseries further developed the show's characters. Additionally, the episode \"Imaginary Resources\" won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation at the [[69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] in 2017. ''Islands'' was released on DVD on January 24, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nA large robotic craft arrives searching for Susan Strong (voiced by [[Jackie Buscarino]]), but the craft is dispatched by Jake (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]). Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]) examines the wreckage and discovers that it is of human origin, which engenders in [[Finn the Human]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) a desire to travel across the sea from whence the craft came and meet others of his kind; Susan, Jake, and BMO accompany Finn on his voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but after a series of mishaps, the group's boat is destroyed by a mysterious colossus, throwing everyone overboard. Finn subsequently wakes up on an island where the weather drastically fluctuates. After meandering around for awhile, he eventually encounters an old lady named Alva (voiced by [[Helena Mattsson]]) who does not speak English. Alva invites Finn to her home and shows her home movies of other humans who have since presumably died. Later, Finn and Alva encounter Jake, who informs the group that he does not know the whereabouts of either BMO and Susan. Finn and Jake eventually head to a futuristic island where all of society has hooked themselves up to a virtual reality simulator. BMO is revealed to have become the heroic leader of the VR people. Jake decides to go and destroy the generator powering the VR after BMO refuses to leave. Feeling bad for BMO, as well as the emaciated humans who emerge from the virtual reality simulator, Finn asks Jake to fix the generator, but BMO fixes it himself. BMO recognizes that if he remains behind, he will lose his friends, and so he, Finn, and Jake take a pod to the next island.  It is on this stop that Finn, Jake and BMO find Susan, who begins to recall her long-forgotten past.\n\nAn extended flashback reveals Finn's origin, and what happened to the other humans. Roughly a thousand years prior to the main events of the series, a group of humans fled Ooo on a container ship (as seen in ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]''). They eventually settled on a secluded island chain far from the mainland. Over the next thousand years, the community grew into a veritable [[utopia]]. With that said, there were those few who occasionally grew dissatisfied with their rigidly structured lives and attempted to flee the island; these \"hiders\" were in turn hunted down and returned by specially trained \"seekers\". It is revealed that Susan's real name is Kara, and that she was once a seeker in training.  Kara was friends with a fellow human, Frieda (voiced by [[Jasika Nicole]]), who began expressing a desire to flee the island. This revelation causes Kara some discomfort, so she approaches Dr. Gross (voiced by [[Lennon Parham]]), the cybernetic human in charge of training seekers, asking if the humans can live off the island. Dr. Gross convinces her that the outside is dangerous and, to prevent her from fleeing, she controls Kara with a remote control. Now fully under Dr. Gross's control, Kara stops Frieda from leaving and drags her away crying. Back in the present, Susan tells Finn her real name and decides to take Finn to Founders Island so that he can be reunited with his mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by [[Sharon Horgan]]).\n\nThe audience is then presented with a series of flashbacks detailing how Minerva, a doctor, met Finn's father Martin Mertens (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) when he was hospitalized after it was mistakenly believed he was attempting to leave the island with a group of escapees. Martin and Minerva eventually fell in love and had Finn. However, when the group of attempted escapees sought revenge on Martin for a previous betrayal, he fled on a boat with Finn. His escape is thwarted by the colossus{{em dash}}revealed to be a security device that was created to protect Founders Island from outside threats{{em dash}}which attacks the craft. In the chaos, the pair are separated, leaving Finn to drift away. The group is arrested and Minerva is heartbroken over Martin and Finn's disappearance.\n\nBack in the present, the group make it to Founders Island where humans have been living in relative peace. While Kara seeks to make amends with Frieda, Finn and Jake discover that Minerva had digitized her consciousness in the past and now exists only in virtual reality. Minerva reveals that she had Dr. Gross send Kara to retrieve Finn, but years had passed and Dr. Gross had accidentally released a deadly virus that was killing humans. Minerva had her essence uploaded into a computer, and then created the helpers to assist the human race. Now that she is with Finn, she expresses her desire that he stay permanently. Finn tries to convince Minerva that life off the island is not all bad, but Minerva thinks off-island life is dangerous. Finn then tries to convince the humans to leave, and they all rally alongside him. This causes Minerva to attempt to upload the consciousnesses of all the islands' inhabitants. To prevent this, Finn shares with her his memories of helping people, causing her to back down; she realizes that Ooo is not nearly a threat as she before believed. The humans all change their minds about leaving, except for Frieda, who announces to Finn, Jake, and BMO that she and Susan have made amends and are leaving to have their own adventures. While setting sail on a new boat bound for Ooo, Finn has one final talk with Minerva through the VR headset, where the two embrace in the digital realm.\n\n==Production==\n\nIn February 2015 at an

It aired as part of the show's [[Adventure Time (season 8)|eighth season]] on [[Cartoon Network]] from January 30, 2017, to February 2, 2017. ''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]), a dog with magical powers to change shape, grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, Finn, Jake, BMO (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]) and Susan Strong (voiced by [[Jackie Buscarino]]) leave Ooo and voyage across the ocean to learn about Finn's origin. During their trip, they encounter various creatures, new friends, and several interesting islands. The trip culminates with a visit to Founder's Island, where Finn meets his biological mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by [[Sharon Horgan]]), and discovers what happened to the remainder of the human race.\n\n''Islands'' is the second ''Adventure Time'' miniseries to have been produced, following ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'', which aired in November 2015. ''Islands'' was preceded by the release of a [[graphic novel]], which tied into the story and served as a prequel. The miniseries' story was developed by head writer [[Kent Osborne]], series showrunner [[Adam Muto]], story editor  Jack Pendarvis, and staff writer [[Ashly Burch]]. Storyboard artists who worked on this miniseries include Sam Alden, Polly Guo, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, [[Tom Herpich]], [[Steve Wolfhard]], [[Graham Falk]], Pendleton Ward, Hanna K. Nystr\u00f6m, Aleks Sennwald, Kent Osborne, and Adam Muto. [[Cole Sanchez]] and Elizabeth Ito served as the miniseries' supervising directors, and Sandra Lee served as art director.\n\n''Islands'' was met with positive reviews, with many critics applauding how the miniseries further developed the show's characters. Additionally, the episode \"Imaginary Resources\" won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation at the [[69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards]] in 2017. ''Islands'' was released on DVD on January 24, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=April 2020}}\nA large robotic craft arrives searching for Susan Strong (voiced by [[Jackie Buscarino]]), as she \"requested\" it in \"Reboot\". When Finn (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) finally encounters it, Jake (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) destroys it with his fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden Walch]]) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] (voiced by [[Olivia Olson]]) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by [[Josh Fadem]]), who turns out to be rather annoying. BMO (voiced by [[Niki Yang]]), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, below the surface of the water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.\n\nAfter an encounter with a mysterious colossus, Finn wakes up on an island where the weather drastically fluctuates. After meandering around for awhile, he eventually encounters an old lady named Alva (voiced by [[Helena Mattsson]]) who does not speak English. Alva invites Finn to her home and shows her home movies of other humans who have since presumably died. Later, Finn, Alva and her pet bear encounter Jake, who informs the group that he does not know the whereabouts of either BMO and Susan. Finn and Jake eventually head to a futuristic island where all of society has hooked themselves up to a virtual reality simulator. BMO is revealed to have become the heroic leader of the VR people, and he rules them along with his sidekick Vinny (voiced by [[Reggie Watts]]). Jake decides to go and destroy the generator powering the VR after BMO refuses to leave. Feeling bad for BMO, as well as the emaciated humans who emerge from the virtual reality simulator, Finn asks Jake to fix the generator, but BMO fixes it himself. BMO recognizes that if he remains behind, he will lose his friends, and so he, Finn, and Jake take a pod to the next island.  It is on this stop that Finn, Jake and BMO find Susan, who begins to recall her long-forgotten past (as well as her adult-level intellect).\n\nAn extended flashback reveals Finn's origin, and what happened to the other humans. Roughly a thousand years prior to the main events of the series, a group of humans{{emdash}}aided by Marceline{{emdash}}fled Ooo on a container ship (as seen in ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]''). They eventually settled on a secluded island chain far from the mainland.  Over the next thousand years, their community thrived and developed into an advanced technological society. While it was a veritable [[utopia]], there were those few who occasionally grew dissatisfied with their rigidly structured lives and attempted to flee the island; these \"hiders\" were in turn hunted down and returned by specially trained \"seekers\". It is revealed that Susan's real name is Kara, and that she was once a seeker in training.  Kara was friends with a fellow human, Frieda (voiced by [[Jasika Nicole]]), who began expressing a desire to flee the safe albeit authoritarian island. This revelation causes Kara some discomfort, so she approaches Dr. Gross (voiced by [[Lennon Parham]]), the cybernetic human in charge of training seekers, asking if the humans can live off the island. Dr. Gross convinces her that the outside is dangerous and, to prevent her from fleeing, she controls Kara with a remote control. Now fully under Dr. Gross's control, Kara stops Frieda from leaving and drags her away crying. Back in the present, Susan tells Finn her real name and decides to take Finn to Founders Island so that he can be reunited with his mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by [[Sharon Horgan]]).\n\nThe audience is then presented with a series of flashbacks detailing how Minerva, a doctor, met Finn's father Martin Mertens (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) when he was hospitalized after it was mistakenly believed he was attempting to leave the island with a group of escapees. Martin and Minerva eventually fell in love and had Finn. However, when the group of attempted escapees{{em dash}}led by an elderly widow (voiced by [[Laraine Newman]]){{em dash}}sought revenge on Martin, he fled on a boat with Finn. His escape is thwarted by the colossus{{em dash}}revealed to be a security device that was created to protect Founders Island from outside threats{{em dash}}who attacks the craft. In the chaos, the pair are separated, leaving Finn to drift away. The group is arrested and Minerva is heartbroken over Martin and Finn's disappearance.\n\nBack in the present, the group make it to Founders Island where humans have been living in relative peace. While Kara seeks to make amends with Frieda, Finn and Jake discover that the island is full of Minerva look-alike robots called \"helpers\". They are brought to the real Minerva{{em dash}}a digitized consciousness{{em dash}}when Finn is identified as her son. Minerva reveals that she had Dr. Gross send Kara to retrieve Finn, but years had passed and Dr. Gross had accidentally released a deadly virus that was killing humans. Minerva had her essence uploaded into a computer, and then created the helpers to assist the human race. Now that she is with Finn, she expresses her desire that he stay permanently. Finn tries to convince Minerva that life off the island is not all bad, but Minerva thinks off-island life is dangerous. Finn then tries to convince the humans to leave, and they all rally alongside him. This causes Minerva to attempt to upload the consciousnesses of all the islands' inhabitants. To prevent this, Finn shares with her his memories of helping people, causing her to back down; she realizes that Ooo is not nearly a threat as she before believed. The humans all change their minds about leaving, except for Frieda. With Minerva's help, they defeat the colossus. Later, Kara and Frieda announce to Finn, Jake, and BMO that they have made amends and are leaving to have their own adventures. Finn has one final talk with Minerva through the VR headset, where the two embrace in the digital realm. Finn then returns to Ooo with Jake and BMO.\n\n==Production==\n\nIn February 2015 at an upfront regarding [[Cartoon Network]]'s programming for the 2015 to 2016 television season, the network

Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claim to have not received anything back.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mashego |first1=Abram |title=\u2018Robbed\u2019 from the pulpit: How Bushiri conned investors out of millions |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/robbed-from-the-pulpit-how-bushiri-conned-investors-out-of-millions-20190225 |website=City Press |publisher=News24.com |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in \"gold minerals\" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. [[East London, Eastern Cape]], police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.<ref name=\"Fuzile 2019\">{{cite web | last=Fuzile | first=Bongani | title=Major One Bushiri 'duped us with gold scam' | website=TimesLIVE | date=10 February 2019 | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-02-10-major-one-bushiri-duped-us-with-gold-scam/ | access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Paternity ===\nIt is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for {{val|80000|fmt=gaps}} Malawian kwacha (about R{{val|1500|fmt=gaps}}) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,\u201d according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \"kept quiet out of fear.\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from City Press seeking comment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makhoba |first1=Ntombizodwa |title=Bushiri\u2019s hidden baby: Family says he tried to bribe woman to have abortion {{!}} City Press |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/bushiris-hidden-baby-family-says-he-tried-to-bribe-woman-to-have-abortion-20190311 |website=News 24 |publisher=City Press |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-payment for clothing ===\nDarlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R{{val|450000|fmt=gaps}} but had not received payment for them.

Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claim to have not received anything back.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mashego |first1=Abram |title=\u2018Robbed\u2019 from the pulpit: How Bushiri conned investors out of millions |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/robbed-from-the-pulpit-how-bushiri-conned-investors-out-of-millions-20190225 |website=City Press |publisher=News24.com |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in \"gold minerals\" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. [[East London, Eastern Cape]], police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.<ref name=\"Fuzile 2019\">{{cite web | last=Fuzile | first=Bongani | title=Major One Bushiri 'duped us with gold scam' | website=TimesLIVE | date=10 February 2019 | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-02-10-major-one-bushiri-duped-us-with-gold-scam/ | access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Paternity ===\nIt is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for {{val|80000|fmt=gaps}} Malawian kwacha (about R{{val|1500|fmt=gaps}}) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,\u201d according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \"kept quiet out of fear.\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from City Press seeking comment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makhoba |first1=Ntombizodwa |title=Bushiri\u2019s hidden baby: Family says he tried to bribe woman to have abortion {{!}} City Press |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/bushiris-hidden-baby-family-says-he-tried-to-bribe-woman-to-have-abortion-20190311 |website=News 24 |publisher=City Press |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-payment for clothing ===\nDarlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R{{val|450000|fmt=gaps}} but had not received payment for them.

Their identity also attracts notable controversy, being that the Cambodian sets are notoriously influential and decorated as their own faction of Crips that is, among other things, racially or ethnically distinct.\n\nAlthough the Asian Boyz gang comprise their own identity as an organization, the identity itself is largely interpreted as an umbrella of individual Crip gangs or \"sets\"; hence their alternative monikers \"Asian Crips\" and \"Asian Boyz Crip\". Though the relationships between these individual sets are unclear, the various Southeast Asian members tend to work with people of their own national, ethnic or cultural background.

Their identity also attracts notable controversy, being that the Cambodian sets are notoriously influential and decorated as their own faction of Crips that is, among other things, racially or ethnically distinct.\n\nAlthough the Asian Boyz gang comprise their own identity as an organization, the identity itself is largely interpreted as an umbrella of individual Crip gangs or \"sets\"; hence their alternative monikers \"Asian Crips\" and \"Asian Boyz Crip\". Though the relationships between these individual sets are unclear, the various Southeast Asian members tend to work with people of their own national, ethnic or cultural background. More recent publications (since 2011) have revealed even more information about the gang, notable details include the alliance of a number of gangs based in Long Beach, California referred to as SEAs, an abbreviation of Suicidal Town, Exotic Family City Crip and Asian boyz.\n\n===Notable crimes===\n\nIn 1990-1991, Pierre Mercado was responsible for four murders, in an attempt to intimidate other gangs.

The flashbacks usually involve Shawn and Gus being taught a lesson by a young Henry Spencer (Shawn's father) ([[Corbin Bernsen]]), who wishes that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a law enforcement officer. These lessons often play a role for the climax of the episode. As a child, Shawn was taught by Henry to hone his powers of observation and deduction, often using games and challenges to test him. Each flashback also sets the theme for the episode.\n\nShawn originally becomes known as a psychic when, after calling in tips on dozens of crimes covered on the news which help the police to close the case, the police become suspicious of his knowledge. The police theorize that such knowledge could only come from the \"inside\" and they decide to arrest him as a suspect. To avoid being sent to jail, Shawn uses his observational skills to convince the police that he is psychic. The interim police chief warns Shawn that if his \"powers\" are fake, he will be prosecuted. With no choice but to keep up the act, and having proven himself an effective aid to the police in solving crimes, he establishes a [[psychic detective]] agency, Psych, and becomes an outside consultant to the police. Pretending to have psychic powers allows him to engage in strange and comic behavior as he turns real clues into hunches and otherworldly visitations. He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Burton Guster (Gus), a pharmaceutical sales representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a blue [[Toyota Echo]] nicknamed \"The Blueberry\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=https://ew.com/article/2010/07/21/psych-dule-hill-reader-questions/ |title='Psych': Dul\u00e9 Hill answers your questions, Part 1|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2020-02-28}}</ref> solving crimes.\n\nHead detective Carlton Lassiter ([[Timothy Omundson]]), playfully nicknamed \"Lassie\" by Shawn and Gus, quietly respects Shawn's crime-solving skills, but doubts his psychic abilities and is constantly exasperated and/or infuriated by his antics.

Santa Barbara is on a mountainous coastline without bays and just has the few [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] miles offshore. Many of the overlooking helicopter shots and set-up shots (in which the exterior of the Santa Barbara Courthouse is shown) are actually filmed in Santa Barbara. The animated segments \"The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus\" were created by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. The music, effects, and sound design for \"The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus\" were created by Fred Weinberg.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe theme song for ''Psych'' is \"I Know You Know\" by The Friendly Indians, series creator [[Steve Franks]]' band. Some episodes in seasons three-eight use an extended version of \"I Know You Know\", consisting of the first verse and the chorus,<ref>A later version of the song performed by The Friendly Indians revealed a second verse that was not used at any point during the course of the show.</ref> but most episodes use a shortened version, consisting of mostly the chorus. In some episodes, the theme song is changed, usually as a tie-in to the theme of the episode to come.\n\n====Variations====\n* The theme was given a Christmas theme for the episode \"Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy\". It was used again in \"Christmas Joy\" (3.09) and \"[[The Polarizing Express]]\".\n* The song was sung in Spanish for \"[[Lights, Camera... Homicidio]]\" and \"No Country for Two Old Men\".\n* It was expanded into a [[Bollywood]]-themed version sung in [[Hindi]] in \"Bollywood Homicide\" while each of the theme credits was shown first in Hindi, then in English.\n* [[Boyz II Men]] performed an ''[[a cappella]]'' version of the theme for \"High Top Fade Out\". It was used again for the episode \"[[Let's Doo-Wop It Again]]\".\n* In  \"Romeo and Juliet and Juliet\", the main titles are translated in Chinese. However, the actual theme song is not edited.\n* Curt Smith of Tears for Fears guest-starred in \"Shawn 2.0\"  and recorded his own version of the theme. Smith also recorded a song (\"This is Christmas\") for the episode \"The Polarizing Express\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/downloads/curtsmith.html |title=Psych TV Series \u2013 Curt Smith \u2013 This is Christmas |publisher=Usanetwork.com |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref>\n* [[Julee Cruise]], who recorded the theme for ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', recorded a slower, extended version of the theme for the ''Twin Peaks''-inspired episode \"[[Dual Spires]]\".\n* A superhero-themed version was recorded for \"[[The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man|The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2]]\". The main titles were also redone in a comic-book style.\n* For the episode \"[[Heeeeere's Lassie]]\", the song and main titles were given a theme similar to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\nThe Christmas-themed and Hindi versions of the song also include variations on the main titles. The Hindi and Chinese-themed episodes phonetically translated words into Devanagari and Chinese characters, respectively, in their title sequences. The title sequence in the episode \"Dual Spires\" is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the title sequence of ''Twin Peaks''. The episode \"[[100 Clues]]\" featured an entirely new main title sequence based on the board game [[Clue (game)|Clue]]. The actor names and title were shown on game cards similar to those of the cards of suspects in Clue.\n\n===Pineapple===\nIn the episode \"[[Pilot (Psych episode)|Pilot]]\", James Roday improvised by picking up a [[pineapple]] and saying, \"Should I slice this up for the road?\" Since then, pineapples have appeared in almost every episode as a running gag. The pineapple is a major marketing point for items related to the show on the USA website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedy Television Series and Mystery TV Show \u2013 Psych TV Series \u2013 USA Network \u2013 What's with the Pineapple? \u2013 USA Network|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/pineapple/|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> Fan movements, such as fan-made websites, have also been dedicated to finding a pineapple or pineapple-related object in each episode.<ref>[http://www.psychpineapple.com psychpineapple.com]</ref>\n\n===\"Psych: The Musical\"===\n{{main|Psych: The Musical}}\nBefore season 8 was aired, the show did a special, 88-minute [[Psych: The Musical|musical episode]].

The flashbacks usually involve Shawn and Gus being taught a lesson by a young Henry Spencer (Shawn's father) ([[Corbin Bernsen]]), who wishes that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a law enforcement officer. These lessons often play a role for the climax of the episode. As a child, Shawn was taught by Henry to hone his powers of observation and deduction, often using games and challenges to test him. Each flashback also sets the theme for the episode.\n\nShawn originally becomes known as a psychic when, after calling in tips on dozens of crimes covered on the news which help the police to close the case, the police become suspicious of his knowledge. The police theorize that such knowledge could only come from the \"inside\" and they decide to arrest him as a suspect. To avoid being sent to jail, Shawn uses his observational skills to convince the police that he is psychic. The interim police chief warns Shawn that if his \"powers\" are fake, he will be prosecuted. With no choice but to keep up the act, and having proven himself an effective aid to the police in solving crimes, he establishes a [[psychic detective]] agency, Psych, and becomes an outside consultant to the police. Pretending to have psychic powers allows him to engage in strange and comic behavior as he turns real clues into hunches and otherworldly visitations. He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Burton Guster (Gus), a pharmaceutical sales representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a blue [[Toyota Echo]] nicknamed \"The Blueberry\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrett |first=Annie |url=https://ew.com/article/2010/07/21/psych-dule-hill-reader-questions/ |title='Psych': Dul\u00e9 Hill answers your questions, Part 1|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2020-02-28}}</ref> solving crimes.\n\nHead detective Carlton Lassiter ([[Timothy Omundson]]), playfully nicknamed \"Lassie\" by Shawn and Gus, quietly respects Shawn's crime-solving skills, but doubts his psychic abilities and is constantly exasperated and/or infuriated by his antics. However, junior detective Juliet \"Jules\" O'Hara ([[Maggie Lawson]]) and Chief Vick ([[Kirsten Nelson]]) are far less antagonistic&nbsp;\u2013 with O'Hara expressing belief in Shawn's abilities, while Vick is mum on the subject&nbsp;\u2013 and usually willing to give Shawn the leeway he needs to solve cases. Henry and Shawn have a difficult relationship, but despite this, Henry reluctantly helps Shawn on various occasions.\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Psych characters}}\n\n===Main===\n[[File:Psychcast.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The cast of ''Psych'', from left to right: [[Maggie Lawson]], [[Corbin Bernsen]], [[James Roday]], [[Kirsten Nelson]], [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]], and [[Timothy Omundson]]]]\n*[[Shawn Spencer]] ([[James Roday]]) is a freelance consultant with the [[Santa Barbara Police Department]] who pretends to be a psychic.\n*[[Gus (Psych)|Burton \"Gus\" Guster]] ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) is Shawn's best friend and business partner.\n*[[Carlton Lassiter|Carlton \"Lassie\" Lassiter]] ([[Timothy Omundson]]) is the head detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department.\n*[[Juliet O'Hara|Juliet \"Jules\" O'Hara]] ([[Maggie Lawson]]) is a junior detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department.\n*[[Karen Vick]] ([[Kirsten Nelson]]) is the SBPD Chief.\n*[[Henry Spencer (Psych)|Henry Spencer]] ([[Corbin Bernsen]]) is Shawn's uptight and precise father and a former police sergeant.\n\n===Recurring===\n*[[List of Psych characters#Young Shawn|Young Shawn]] (seasons 1\u20135: [[Liam James]]; seasons 5\u20136: [[Skyler Gisondo]]) is the younger version of Shawn Spencer.\n*[[List of Psych characters#Young Gus|Young Gus]] (Carlos McCullers II) is the younger version of Burton \"Gus\" Guster.\n*[[Buzz McNab]] ([[Sage Brocklebank]]) is a naive but lovable cop who often provides Shawn and Gus with clues.\n*[[Madeleine Spencer]] ([[Cybill Shepherd]]) is a police psychologist who is Shawn's mother and Henry's ex-wife.\n*[[Abigail Lytar]] ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]) is Shawn's high-school crush.\n*[[Winnie Guster]] ([[Phylicia Rashad]]) is Gus' mother.\n*[[Bill Guster]] (season 2: [[Ernie Hudson]]; season 3: [[Keith David]]) is Gus' father.\n*[[Mr. Yang]] ([[Ally Sheedy]]) was a serial killer.\n*[[Mary Lightly]] ([[Jimmi Simpson]]) was a department psychologist who was an expert on Mr. Yang.\n*[[Woody the Coroner]] ([[Kurt Fuller]]) is a police coroner with whom Shawn shares a mutual respect.\n*[[Pierre Despereaux]] ([[Cary Elwes]]) is an extremely elusive Canadian art thief.\n*[[Declan Rand]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]) is a rich criminal profiler.\n*[[Marlowe Viccellio]] ([[Kristy Swanson]]) is a woman Lassiter meets and later marries.\n*Curt Smith ([[Curt Smith|himself]]) is the former singer of the band [[Tears for Fears]].\n* {{anchor|Frank O'Hara}}Frank O'Hara ([[William Shatner]]) is Juliet's estranged father.\n*Rachael ([[Parminder Nagra]]) is Gus's girlfriend.\n*Lloyd French ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) is Juliet's stepfather.\n*Harris Trout ([[Anthony Michael Hall]]) is a special consultant hired by the mayor to increase efficiency at the SBPD.\n*Betsy Brannigan ([[Mira Sorvino]]) takes over as the new head detective when Lassiter is promoted to chief.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Psych episodes}}\n{{:List of Psych episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe show uses [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], British Columbia, Canada for its Santa Barbara, California setting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Filming locations for \"Psych\" (2006)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491738/locations|work=imdb.com|accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> ''Psych'' also incorporates [[Vancouver]] and various locations around the [[Lower Mainland]] of British Columbia as a backdrop. Santa Barbara is on a mountainous coastline without bays and just has the few [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] miles offshore. Many of the overlooking helicopter shots and set-up shots (in which the exterior of the Santa Barbara Courthouse is shown) are actually filmed in Santa Barbara. The animated segments \"The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus\" were created by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. The music, effects, and sound design for \"The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus\" were created by Fred Weinberg.\n\n===Theme song===\nThe theme song for ''Psych'' is \"I Know You Know\" by The Friendly Indians, series creator [[Steve Franks]]' band. Some episodes in seasons three-eight use an extended version of \"I Know You Know\", consisting of the first verse and the chorus,<ref>A later version of the song performed by The Friendly Indians revealed a second verse that was not used at any point during the course of the show.</ref> but most episodes use a shortened version, consisting of mostly the chorus. In some episodes, the theme song is changed, usually as a tie-in to the theme of the episode to come.\n\n====Variations====\n* The theme was given a Christmas theme for the episode \"Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy\". It was used again in \"Christmas Joy\" (3.09) and \"[[The Polarizing Express]]\".\n* The song was sung in Spanish for \"[[Lights, Camera... Homicidio]]\" and \"No Country for Two Old Men\".\n* It was expanded into a [[Bollywood]]-themed version sung in [[Hindi]] in \"Bollywood Homicide\" while each of the theme credits was shown first in Hindi, then in English.\n* [[Boyz II Men]] performed an ''[[a cappella]]'' version of the theme for \"High Top Fade Out\". It was used again for the episode \"[[Let's Doo-Wop It Again]]\".\n* In  \"Romeo and Juliet and Juliet\", the main titles are translated in Chinese. However, the actual theme song is not edited.\n* Curt Smith of Tears for Fears guest-starred in \"Shawn 2.0\"  and recorded his own version of the theme. Smith also recorded a song (\"This is Christmas\") for the episode \"The Polarizing Express\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/downloads/curtsmith.html |title=Psych TV Series \u2013 Curt Smith \u2013 This is Christmas |publisher=Usanetwork.com |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}</ref>\n* [[Julee Cruise]], who recorded the theme for ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', recorded a slower, extended version of the theme for the ''Twin Peaks''-inspired episode \"[[Dual Spires]]\".\n* A superhero-themed version was recorded for \"[[The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man|The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2]]\". The main titles were also redone in a comic-book style.\n* For the episode \"[[Heeeeere's Lassie]]\", the song and main titles were given a theme similar to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\nThe Christmas-themed and Hindi versions of the song also include variations on the main titles. The Hindi and Chinese-themed episodes phonetically translated words into Devanagari and Chinese characters, respectively, in their title sequences. The title sequence in the episode \"Dual Spires\" is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the title sequence of ''Twin Peaks''. The episode \"[[100 Clues]]\" featured an entirely new main title sequence based on the board game [[Clue (game)|Clue]]. The actor names and title were shown on game cards similar to those of the cards of suspects in Clue.\n\n===Pineapple===\nIn the episode \"[[Pilot (Psych episode)|Pilot]]\", James Roday improvised by picking up a [[pineapple]] and saying, \"Should I slice this up for the road?\" Since then, pineapples have appeared in almost every episode as a running gag. The pineapple is a major marketing point for items related to the show on the USA website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedy Television Series and Mystery TV Show \u2013 Psych TV Series \u2013 USA Network \u2013 What's with the Pineapple? \u2013 USA Network|url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/psych/pineapple/|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> Fan movements, such as fan-made websites, have also been dedicated to finding a pineapple or pineapple-related object in each episode.<ref>[http://www.psychpineapple.com psychpineapple.com]</ref>\n\n===\"Psych: The Musical\"===\n{{main|Psych: The Musical}}\nBefore season 8 was aired, the show did a special, 88-minute [[Psych: The Musical|musical episode]].
