The song is frequently, though erroneously, cited as a traditional [[Quaker]] or [[Shakers|Shaker]] hymn. The original composition has now entered into the [[public domain]], and appears in several hymnals and song collections, both in its original form and with a revised text. Though it was not originally a Quaker hymn, twentieth-century Quakers adopted it as their own and use it widely today.\n\n==Authorship and lyrics==\n\nThe first known publication of the words was on August 7, 1868, in ''[[Sidney Edwards Morse|The New York Observer]]'',  Titled \"Always Rejoicing\", and, attributed to \"Pauline T.\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/texts/singing.txt |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011183054/http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/%7Emudws/texts/singing.txt |archive-date=October 11, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"mudcat1\">[http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=32196&messages=46 song history - How Can I Keep From Singing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306131230/http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=32196&messages=46 |date=March 6, 2012 }}. mudcat.org.

Plenn contributed the following verse around 1950, which was taken up by [[Pete Seeger]] and other folk revivalists:<ref name=\"mudcat1\"/>\n\n::When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,\n:::And hear their death-knell ringing,\n::When friends rejoice both far and near,\n:::How can I keep from singing?\n::In prison cell and dungeon vile,\n:::Our thoughts to them go winging;\n::When friends by shame are undefiled,\n:::How can I keep from singing?\n\n==History==\nDuring the 20th century, this hymn was not widely used in congregational worship.

His version made this song fairly well known in the [[folk revival]] of the 1960s. Seeger's version omits or modifies much of the Christian wording of the original, and adds Plenn's verse above. The reference in the added verse intended by Seeger and by Plenn\u2014both active in left-wing causes\u2014is to 'witch hunts' of the House Un-American Activities Committee. (Seeger himself was sentenced to a year in jail in 1955 as a result of his testimony before the Committee, which he did not serve due to a technicality.){{vague|date=June 2018}}{{cn|date=June 2018}} Most folk singers have followed Seeger's version.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 80s, ''How Can I Keep From Singing'' was recorded by Catholic Folk musician Ed Gutfreund (on an album called \"From An Indirect Love\"); the music was published in a widely used Catholic Hymnal called \"Glory and Praise\"; it was popular among Catholic liturgical music ministers, especially those who used guitar.

But learning it in social activist circles of the fifties and hearing Seeger's (erroneous) attribution endeared the song to many contemporary Quakers, who have adopted it as a sort of anthem. It was published in the Quaker songbook ''Songs of the Spirit'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Friends General Conference Religious Education Committee|first=|title=Songs of the Spirit|publisher=Friends General Conference|location=Philadelphia|year=1978}}</ref> and the original words, with Plenn's verse, were included in the much more ambitious Quaker hymnal project, ''Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal''<ref>{{cite book|last=Friends General Conference|first=|title=Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal|publisher=Friends General Conference|location=Philadelphia|year=1996}}</ref> in 1996.\n\n== Enya version ==\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = How Can I Keep From Singing?\n| cover      = Enyahowcan.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Enya]]\n| album      = [[Shepherd Moons]]\n| B-side     = {{ubl|'S F\u00e1gaim Mo Bhaile|O\u00edche Chi\u00fain (Silent Night)}}\n| released   = 1991\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1990\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[New-age music|New-age]]\n| length     = 4:24\n| label      = [[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| writer     = [[Robert Wadsworth Lowry]]\n| producer   = [[Nicky Ryan]]\n| prev_title = [[Caribbean Blue]]\n| prev_year  = 1991\n| next_title = [[Book of Days (song)|Book of Days]]\n| next_year  = 1992\n| misc       = {{External music video|\n{{YouTube|MM8mOKfxmWw|\"How Can I Keep From Singing?\"}}}}\n}}\n\nThe song received new prominence in 1991 when Irish musician [[Enya]] released a recording of the hymn on her [[album]] ''[[Shepherd Moons]]''. Enya's version follows Pete Seeger's replacement of some more overtly Christian lines, for example: \"What tho' my joys and comforts die?\nThe Lord my Saviour liveth\" became \"What tho' the tempest 'round me roars, I hear the truth it liveth.\"\n\nEnya and her record company were sued for copyright infringement by Sanga Music, Inc. for recording the song because she had mistakenly credited this track as a \"traditional Shaker hymn\", thus assumed it as public domain. [[Pete Seeger]] had helped make the song fairly well known in the 1950s by publishing it with Doris Plenn's additional third verse in his folk music magazine Sing Out! (Vol. 7, No 1. 1957), recording it, and mistakenly credited it as a \"traditional Quaker hymn\" without copyrighting Plenn's verse, thus presenting the entire song as \"public domain\". It was again published by Sanga Music, Inc. in 1964. Seeger had presented the new verse as being public domain and Plenn had only wanted the song to be preserved rather than seeking to make a profit from it, so the court decided that Enya could use the verse without paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fishman|first1=Stephen|title=Copyright and the Public Domain|url=http://lawcatalog.com/FilesUploaded/product/SampleFiles/ljp_694PublicDomain.pdf|website=www.lawcatalog.com|publisher=ALM|accessdate=May 20, 2017|page=6-6}}</ref>\n\nThe song was also released as a single in November of the same year, with \"O\u00edche Chi\u00fan\" and \"'S F\u00e1gaim Mo Bhaile\" appearing as additional songs.<!--(''Chi\u00fan'' is an apparent misspelling of ''Chi\u00fain''.)--><!--('''S F\u00e1gaim Mo Bhaile was mistyped as 'S Fagain Mo Bhaile''.)-->{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe videoclip featured Enya singing in a church in the [[Gaoth Dobhair]] countryside, while also including archive footage of political figures such as [[Nelson Mandela]] or [[Boris Yeltsin]] among others, and references to the [[Gulf War]] and famine.

In this,{{vague|date=June 2018}} and in a 1993 recording by [[Marty Haugen]], Jeanne Cotter, and [[David Haas]], the quatrain beginning: \"No storm can shake my inmost calm ...\" is used as a repeated refrain.\n\nIt is also sung by Dahlia Malloy ([[Minnie Driver]]) in the episode 'Virgin Territory' from Season One of [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s ''[[The Riches]]''.\n\nIn his radio singing debut, actor [[Martin Sheen]] performed this song (using the Plenn\u2013Seeger lyrics) on ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' in September 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2007/09/29/ |title=A Prairie Home Companion for September 29, 2007 |publisher=American Public Media |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704143620/http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/2007/09/29/ |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt has been used on the 2009 Christmas advertisement for the UK supermarket, [[Waitrose]], in a performance by [[Camilla Kerslake]].\n\nContemporary Christian artist [[Chris Tomlin]] clearly was inspired by the song when he wrote his song, \"How Can I Keep from Singing\" in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== Use by Quakers ==\n\nThe song has often been attributed to \"early\" Quakers, but Quakers did not permit congregational singing in worship until after the American Civil War (and many still do not have music regularly). But learning it in social activist circles of the fifties and hearing Seeger's (erroneous) attribution endeared the song to many contemporary Quakers, who have adopted it as a sort of anthem. It was published in the Quaker songbook ''Songs of the Spirit'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Friends General Conference Religious Education Committee|first=|title=Songs of the Spirit|publisher=Friends General Conference|location=Philadelphia|year=1978}}</ref> and the original words, with Plenn's verse, were included in the much more ambitious Quaker hymnal project, ''Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal''<ref>{{cite book|last=Friends General Conference|first=|title=Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal|publisher=Friends General Conference|location=Philadelphia|year=1996}}</ref> in 1996.\n\n== Enya version ==\n\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = How Can I Keep From Singing?\n| cover      = Enyahowcan.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Enya]]\n| album      = [[Shepherd Moons]]\n| B-side     = {{ubl|'S F\u00e1gaim Mo Bhaile|O\u00edche Chi\u00fain (Silent Night)}}\n| released   = 1991\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1990\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[New-age music|New-age]]\n| length     = 4:24\n| label      = [[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| writer     = [[Robert Wadsworth Lowry]]\n| producer   = [[Nicky Ryan]]\n| prev_title = [[Caribbean Blue]]\n| prev_year  = 1991\n| next_title = [[Book of Days (song)|Book of Days]]\n| next_year  = 1992\n| misc       = {{External music video|\n{{YouTube|MM8mOKfxmWw|\"How Can I Keep From Singing?\"}}}}\n}}\n\nThe song received new prominence in 1991 when Irish musician [[Enya]] released a recording of the hymn on her [[album]] ''[[Shepherd Moons]]''. Enya's version follows Pete Seeger's replacement of some more overtly Christian lines, for example: \"What tho' my joys and comforts die?\nThe Lord my Saviour liveth\" became \"What tho' the tempest 'round me roars, I hear the truth it liveth.\"\n\nEnya and her record company were sued for copyright infringement by Sanga Music, Inc. for recording the song because she had mistakenly credited this track as a \"traditional Shaker hymn\", thus assumed it as public domain. [[Pete Seeger]] had helped make the song fairly well known in the 1950s by publishing it with Doris Plenn's additional third verse in his folk music magazine Sing Out! (Vol. 7, No 1. 1957), recording it, and mistakenly credited it as a \"traditional Quaker hymn\" without copyrighting Plenn's verse, thus presenting the entire song as \"public domain\". It was again published by Sanga Music, Inc. in 1964. Seeger had presented the new verse as being public domain and Plenn had only wanted the song to be preserved rather than seeking to make a profit from it, so the court decided that Enya could use the verse without paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fishman|first1=Stephen|title=Copyright and the Public Domain|url=http://lawcatalog.com/FilesUploaded/product/SampleFiles/ljp_694PublicDomain.pdf|website=www.lawcatalog.com|publisher=ALM|accessdate=May 20, 2017|page=6-6}}</ref>\n\nThe song was also released as a single in November of the same year, with \"O\u00edche Chi\u00fan\" and \"'S F\u00e1gaim Mo Bhaile\" appearing as additional songs.<!--(''Chi\u00fan'' is an apparent misspelling of ''Chi\u00fain''.)--><!--('''S F\u00e1gaim Mo Bhaile was mistyped as 'S Fagain Mo Bhaile''.)-->{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe videoclip featured Enya singing in a church in the [[Gaoth Dobhair]] countryside, while also including archive footage of political figures such as [[Nelson Mandela]] or [[Boris Yeltsin]] among others, and references to the [[Gulf War]] and famine.
