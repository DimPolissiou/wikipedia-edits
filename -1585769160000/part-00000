[[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} The eleven movements of a symmetrical structure employ three to five voices in different combinations. Bach used means of [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt an earlier dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorales from the motet were part of a manuscript collection of chorale settings around 1735. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. The work, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]] in his position as [[Thomaskantor]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed cycles of [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]] for the Sundays and feast days of the Lutheran liturgical calendar. He wrote some church cantatas for occasions such as weddings and funerals. He also composed [[Motet (Bach)|motets]], probably as comparable occasional works.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''colla parte'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912 that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]]. The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet, thus the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723 and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text ===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The [[stanza]]s are in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of the last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\nIn the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers take as their text one verse from the epistle writing.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\n=== Chorale melody ===\nThe chorale melody was composed by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653) and first appeared in his hymnal ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''.

The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing [[colla parte]] in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the following verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Defiance is expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe structure of the motet is unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived. Three of the chorales, movements 1 (which is the same as 11), 3 and 7 are contained in Dietel's manuscript, a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated around 1735.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nWith the other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA), edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to describe the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was the first of Bach's motets to be recorded in 1927. This version was sung in English translation and was conducted by [[Charles Kennedy Scott]].<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> It has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} Performers have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small choir or larger group, continuo, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989.

[[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} The eleven movements of a symmetrical structure employ three to five voices in different combinations. Bach used means of [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt an earlier dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorales from the motet were part of a manuscript collection of chorale settings around 1735. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. The work, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]] in his position as [[Thomaskantor]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed cycles of [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]] for the Sundays and feast days of the Lutheran liturgical calendar. He wrote some church cantatas for occasions such as weddings and funerals. He also composed [[Motet (Bach)|motets]], probably as comparable occasional works.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''colla parte'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912 that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]]. The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet, thus the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723 and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text ===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The [[stanza]]s are in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of the last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\nIn the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers take as their text one verse from the epistle writing.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\n=== Chorale melody ===\nThe chorale melody was composed by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653) and first appeared in his hymnal ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''. The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing [[colla parte]] in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

The text, in the first person, speaks of longing for Jesus.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Jones noted that the tenor part is particularly expressive.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The last movement has exactly the same music to the different text of the last stanza, creating a frame.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 2 ====\nThe second movement begins with excerpts from the Epistle to the Romans with \"{{lang|de|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches an denen, die in Christo Jesu sind|italic=no}}\" (Now there is nothing damnable in those who are in Christ Jesus).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The difference of living in the flesh and the spirit is an aspect that will be repeated  throughout the motet.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The movement is also in E minor, but for five voices.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=4}} The text is rendered first in rhetorical homophony.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nIn setting the first sentence, Bach accented the word \"nichts\" (nothing), repeating it twice, with long rests and echo dynamics. Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the following verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Defiance is expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} It is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence that cherishes the world).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice and two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Gute Nacht\" often.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found that the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matched compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"Dennoch bleibst du auch im Leide, / Jesu, meine Freude\" (You stay with me even in sorrow, / Jesus, my joy).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe structure of the motet is unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, even illustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived. Three of the chorales, movements 1 (which is the same as 11), 3 and 7 are contained in Dietel's manuscript, a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated around 1735.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the {{lang|de|Gewandhauskapellmeister}}.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nWith the other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA), edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is not conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to describe the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the cantus firmus in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was the first of Bach's motets to be recorded in 1927. This version was sung in English translation and was conducted by [[Charles Kennedy Scott]].<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> It has been recorded more than 60 times, mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} Performers have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small choir or larger group, continuo, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]].

It was written by [[Lindy Robbins]] and [[Toby Gad]], with the latter also producing the song. The song was released on September 7, 2010 as the second and final single from the band's [[A Year Without Rain|second album of the same name]]. It was the band's 4th single released on September 7, 2010. A Spanish-language version of the song was also recorded, entitled \"'''Un A\u00f1o Sin Lluvia'''\" {{IPA-es|un \u02c8a\u0272o si\u0272 \u02c8\u028eu\u03b2ja|}}. Gomez titled the album for the song because she wanted to base all the other songs around it. Musically, the song is a [[Eurodance]] track backed with a [[disco]] beat. In its lyrics, the song's protagonist compares yearning for her love to a year without rain.\n\nMusic critics gave the song positive reviews, complimenting it as a dance ballad and noting Gomez's vocal maturity. \"A Year Without Rain\" became the band's third consecutive top forty single in the United States and Canada. It also charted in the lower regions of some European countries. The song is [[Music recording certification|certified]] Double Platinum in the US. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Chris Dooley and shot on-site in [[Lucerne Valley, California]] features Gomez frolicking in the desert surrounded by a swarm of photographs of her and her love interest, before they meet during a rainstorm. The band performed the song a number of times via live performances, including on televised programs such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the [[37th People's Choice Awards|2011 People's Choice Awards]].\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{listen\n| filename    = SelGomez AYearWithoutRain.ogg\n| pos         = left\n| title       = \"A Year Without Rain\"\n| description = A sample of \"A Year Without Rain\", a [[Eurodance]] track which utilizes a [[disco]] backing.\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nIn early 2010, a demo of the song, performed by singer [[RaVaughn]] leaked online.

It was written by [[Lindy Robbins]] and [[Toby Gad]], with the latter also producing the song. The song was released on September 7, 2010 as the second and final single from the band's [[A Year Without Rain|second album of the same name]]. A Spanish-language version of the song was also recorded, entitled \"'''Un A\u00f1o Sin Lluvia'''\" {{IPA-es|un \u02c8a\u0272o si\u0272 \u02c8\u028eu\u03b2ja|}}. Gomez titled the album for the song because she wanted to base all the other songs around it. Musically, the song is a [[Eurodance]] track backed with a [[disco]] beat. In its lyrics, the song's protagonist compares yearning for her love to a year without rain.\n\nMusic critics gave the song positive reviews, complimenting it as a dance ballad and noting Gomez's vocal maturity. \"A Year Without Rain\" became the band's third consecutive top forty single in the United States and Canada. It also charted in the lower regions of some European countries. The song is [[Music recording certification|certified]] Double Platinum in the US. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Chris Dooley and shot on-site in [[Lucerne Valley, California]] features Gomez frolicking in the desert surrounded by a swarm of photographs of her and her love interest, before they meet during a rainstorm. The band performed the song a number of times via live performances, including on televised programs such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the [[37th People's Choice Awards|2011 People's Choice Awards]].\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{listen\n| filename    = SelGomez AYearWithoutRain.ogg\n| pos         = left\n| title       = \"A Year Without Rain\"\n| description = A sample of \"A Year Without Rain\", a [[Eurodance]] track which utilizes a [[disco]] backing.\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nIn early 2010, a demo of the song, performed by singer [[RaVaughn]] leaked online.

It produced a number of distinguished alumni, including eleven future members of Parliament. One of these was WE Forster (1818\u20131886), a member of a local Tottenham Quaker family. He took the 1870 Education Act through Parliament, ensuring every child was entitled to at least an elementary education. Other well-known alumni included Dr Daniel Tuke (1827\u201395), an early mental health physician and Joseph Lister (1827\u20131912), a pioneer of antiseptic surgery.<ref>Schools of the Edmonton Hundred, GW Sturges</ref> Grove House School was one of several boarding schools in Tottenham with a nationwide reputation that were established from the late 17th century to the end of the 18th century. These included Bathsua Makin's \u2018school for gentlewomen\u2019 at Tottenham High Cross, and Bruce Castle School in Lordship Lane, established by the Hill family. One member of the Hill family was Sir Rowland Hill, who established the postal system by the introduction of the penny post.<ref>Tottenham: A History, Christine Protz</ref>\n\n'''Tottenham Polytechnic 1897\u20131936'''\n\nGrove House School closed in 1878 and from 1892 the building was used for classes in art, science and technical subjects. In 1897 it was purchased by Middlesex County Council, becoming Tottenham Polytechnic. In 1901 the Polytechnic shared accommodation with the newly opened Tottenham County School (see below), which used the Grove House premises during the day time. Polytechnic day classes were confined to the school of art, with science, technical and commercial studies largely taking place in the evening.\n\nIn 1909 the Polytechnic offered courses in art, physiology and hygiene, science, technology, building construction, plumbing and carpentry, as well as land surveying, bus routine and gas manufacture. The commercial department included the theory and practice of commerce, shorthand and typing, commercial geography and history.<ref>Committee for Higher Education in Tottenham, 1909</ref>\n\nIn 1910 additional buildings were constructed at the rear and the premises then comprised an assembly hall for up to 500 people, 11 classrooms, laboratories, dark room, art rooms and cookery rooms. The trade and industry courses had now expanded to include quantity surveying and mechanical engineering. There were also specialist classes in telegraphy and telephony taught by a GPO engineer, and gas supply, taught on the Gas Company premises by a gas works engineer. Particularly diverse were the commercial courses, which included commercial and industrial law, modern foreign languages (\u2018excellent teaching\u2019), shorthand and typing, banking, book keeping and accountancy. In addition to the Trade and Commercial courses, there were domestic classes in cookery, dressmaking and millinery.<ref>Board of Education Report, Tottenham Polytechnic 1911</ref>\n\nThis range of courses reflected the nature of Tottenham's population and industry at the time. Industry consisted mainly of many small engineering and manufacturing firms, together with the nascent gas and telephone companies. There was also a considerable amount of building work with a rapid development of houses, shops, commercial and civic buildings taking place in the district at this time. Tottenham's population was mainly residential, with clerks and professional workers commuting to the City and other nearby areas. The 1911 Report noted the difficulties faced by evening-class students who often did not arrive home from work until 7.30 or 8.00 pm. Nevertheless, by 1911 there were 1,191 evening students.\n\nIn 1913 the County School moved to its new building on Tottenham Green and the Polytechnic was able to expand by extending daytime courses. A day Junior Technical School offering a two-year course for students age 13 to 16 was opened. The junior day schools were enlarged again between the wars with a Junior Technical School for boys age 13\u201316 in building and allied trades and a Junior Commercial School for girls and boys age 13\u201316 offering a general education, together with office and clerical skills. These schools provided a secondary education that could lead to apprenticeships in industry or careers in business and the professions.<ref>Tottenham Education Week Handbook, 1936</ref>\n\nThere was also expansion in the third department of the Polytechnic, the Evening Institute, with four other centres across Tottenham being used. Classes were offered in art, science, matriculation, secretarial, accountancy and languages. There were courses in banking and the civil service, as well as technical and building work. The pioneering Blanche Nevile School for the Deaf, run by Tottenham Borough Council, was in nearby Philip Lane and the Polytechnic responded with classes in lip reading for teachers and parents, and language skills classes for deaf adults.<ref>Tottenham Polytechnic Prospectus 1923\u201324 (evening)</ref>\n\n'''The War Years and after: 1939\u20131970'''\n\n'''Tottenham Technical College'''\n\nStudent numbers rose from 857 in 1908\u20139 to 102,827 in 1938\u201339 <ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\">HMI Report 1950</ref> and rebuilding became a necessity. Grove House was demolished in 1936 <ref>Invitation to witness demolition of Grove House</ref> and the new building was opened in 1939. The Polytechnic was renamed Tottenham Technical College. The War disrupted work of the College, although courses continued to run, particularly as there was an urgent need for skilled labour in building and engineering. Part of the College was taken over by the Civil Defence, the control room for the Tottenham ARP (Air Raid Precautions) and the Auxiliary Fire Service, and normal work was frequently disrupted by air raids. In December 1940 a bomb damaged part of the recently built rear wing.<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/>\n[[File:Tottenham Technical college.jpg|alt=Tottenham Technical college|thumb|Tottenham Technical college]]\nAfter the war, College work began to get back on course. The two junior departments now came under the 1944 Education Act which established secondary education for all through a selective system. Pupils sat the 11 plus examination in the last year of primary education to decide whether they went to a grammar school, secondary modern, or one of the many varied intermediate schools, such as technical schools, introduced by different local education authorities. Tottenham's two junior colleges, more vocationally oriented than other schools, started at age 13, and access to their courses was through competitive examination. During the course of the 1960s, however, these two departments were gradually phased out with changes in secondary education.<ref>Tottenham College of Technology Opening of New Building 1973</ref>\n\nBy 1950, numbers had increased to 420,139 <ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/> and in 1955 a large extension was opened behind the main building to house the junior departments and technology department. In 1950, the College ran two main senior departments covering day and evening classes.<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/> The Department of Technology taught all aspects of building work and gas engineering and fitting. There were also classes in cabinet making, with the large furniture company Harris Lebus in Tottenham Hale being the biggest employer in the district. The Department of Commerce, established in 1945, ran degree courses in the evening for BA, BSc and BSc(Com) degrees. There were courses for Bankers, Auctioneers, Estate Agents, Local Government workers and Sales Managers, reflecting the high numbers of professional and middle-class workers in the locality. There were altogether 1,200 evening students in this department, with three main courses \u2013 professional, secretarial and general education. Day and evening classes were run offering secretarial, shorthand and typing courses, as well as general education. Apprentices from local industries attended general education classes as part of their day-release training.<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/>\n\nAdditional to the two main Departments, there were courses such as catering, cookery, dressmaking and Nursery Nurse training. The HMI report suggested these should be included in a Women's Department, especially as nearly half the students in the College, day and evening, were women (many of course in the Department of Commerce).<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/> By 1955 a short-lived Department of Women's Studies had been established.<ref>Tottenham College of Technology Opening of New Building, 1973</ref>  By 1964, the College Departments had expanded to five; Science, Health, Hairdressing, Social Studies, Business Studies and Technology. Additional classes and workshops were run in Edmonton, in the Montagu Road Centre and Wilbury Way.<ref>Tottenham Technical College Prospectus 1964\u201365</ref>\n\n'''Tottenham College of Technology: 1970 \u2013 1990'''\n\nFollowing local government reorganisation in 1965, the College transferred to the London Borough of Haringey. Shortly after, the Council designated a site adjacent to the College for extensions to accommodate increasing numbers and replace the two College sites in Edmonton, now part of Enfield Council. Three new blocks were opened in 1973, joined to each other and to the existing building by means of a bridge at first floor level. A second phase Tower Block was also planned. The College now became Tottenham College of Technology, and its five Departments were reorganised into Department of Building, Department of Business and Administration Studies, Department of Health, Hairdressing and Floristry, Department of Mechanical Services and Engineering and Department of Public Health and Science.<ref>Tottenham College of Technology Opening of New Building 1970</ref>\n\n'''Merger leads to creation of The College of North East London in 1990'''\n\nIn April 1990, Tottenham College of technology merged with Haringey College to become the College of North East London. In January 1991 Adult Education also joined the College making a large and very diverse institution on seven sites spread across the Borough of Haringey.\n\n'''Incorporation \u2013 1993'''\n\nOn 1 April 1993, like every other maintained college in the country, The College of North East London became a corporation. It ceased to be maintained by the London Borough of Haringey and became an independent institution employing over 700 staff, owning its premises and funded by government via the Further Education Funding Council. During the summer of 1993 major refurbishment took place. The Department of Environmental Health and Public administration moved to Bounds Green centre, Art and Design moved to Muswell Hill Centre and the Department of Business and Computing Studied was concentrated at Tottenham Centre. The Hairdressing and Beauty Therapy salons were refurbished and new computer suites created in the Tower Block.\n\n'''1997 \u2013 Present'''\n\nIn 1997, the Tottenham Centre celebrated its centenary and in 2000, completed a new entrance and ground floor extension named the Centenary Building.\n\n'''Tottenham Green'''\n\n'''Early Years in the Polytechnic 1901\u20131913'''\n\nThis site, built in 1913, is based in the former Tottenham County School. The County School was established by Middlesex County Council in 1901 as its first co-educational selective grammar school, and it was one of the first in the country. There were concerns that mixed gender education would be a challenging environment for girls and that boys would be held back. However, the headmaster Mr CH Peters noted that the fear of many parents regarding mixed education proved groundless <ref>MCC Minutes of Tottenham Polytechnic October 1901</ref> and when His Majesty's Inspector's visited in 1902, they generally agreed that a mixed school was positive.<ref>MCC Minutes of Committee of Tottenham Polytechnic February 1902</ref> The County School was first based in Grove House when it was the home of Tottenham Polytechnic (see above), and the history of the two institutions have been connected from the beginning. The County School, in spite of its temporary premises, got off to a good start as recorded by HMI reports. Numbers on roll started around 80, but reached 141 by the end of the year, 69 of whom were girls and 72 boys. The pupils came from a wide area, as well as Tottenham, including Edmonton, Waltham Cross, Hornsey, Wood Green, Finsbury Park, Stoke Newington, Shoreditch and Hackney.<ref>MCC Minutes of Committee of Tottenham Polytechnic October 1902</ref> As a secondary grammar school, it was fee paying with charges of 31s6d a term, although following the 1907 Education Act some free places were reserved for successful scholarship entrants from state elementary schools\n\n'''The County School on the Green 1913\u20131963'''\n\nIn 1913 the school moved to the new building on Tottenham Green. It is part of a parade of Edwardian former Civic buildings on the east side of Tottenham Green which once included the Town Hall, swimming baths and fire station. These are now occupied by small businesses and voluntary organisations, and include the Bernie Grant Arts Centre. Tottenham Green itself, from Philip Lane to the former Grove House, on both sides of the High Road, was once the location of 17th and 18th century mansion houses occupied by the Tottenham gentry of the time, many of whom were Quakers. A number of the gentry living here played a significant part in national and international affairs, including education, the abolition of the slave trade, and social reform such as the opening of the first Penny Savings Bank by local Quaker, Priscilla Wakefield.<ref>Tottenham: A History, by Christine Protz; The Quakers of Tottenham 1775\u20131825 by R Collie</ref>\n\nDuring the years in which it was based at the Polytechnic, Tottenham County School numbers rose to around 400. The new building on Tottenham Green had spaces for 450, but by 1936, the numbers had reached 543 <ref>Victoria County History, Middlesex vol v</ref> due to rising numbers of children in the local population. They dropped dramatically during the War, when the school was evacuated to March, Cambridgeshire, in September 1939. In August 1940 half the evacuees returned to continue their education and the school re-opened on 9 September 1940. The Blitz had, however, started and return was delayed due to an unexploded bomb on Tottenham Green. When the school did commence work, staff and students had to share their premises with the ARP (Air Raid Precautions) and the Food Office. Students and teachers were confined to three rooms on the top floor, but nevertheless were able to present a full form for GCE examinations. Eventually, the ARP and Food Office moved out to other accommodation, and the rest of the school returned in September 1942, continuing their studies as best they could with the continuous interruptions of air raids day and night.<ref>Tottenham County School Chronicle 1944</ref>\n\nAfter the War numbers at the school continued to increase, reaching 658 in 1953. Extra space was found in nearby High Cross Memorial Hall and new buildings were planned at Selby Road, Devonshire Hill. These were occupied in 1963, but Tottenham County School closed in 1967 with the reorganisation of all Haringey Secondary schools into comprehensives. It became Tottenham School.<ref>Tottenham County School Chronicle, December 1963</ref>\n\n'''After the County School 1963\u2013Present Day'''\n\nThe Tottenham Green building continued to be used for education in the years since. In 1970 it was used by Moselle school, a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties, until its move to new buildings in Adams Road in 1973. Another new school starting life in this building was Northumberland Park Community School, which opened in 1972. It later moved to new accommodation in Trulock Road, Northumberland Park.<ref>Victoria County History, Middlesex, Vol V</ref>\n\n'''Enfield Centre'''\n\n'''Electronics and Armaments: 1901\u20131918'''\n\nThe history of the Enfield Centre can be traced back to 1901, when Sir Joseph Swan opened the Ediswan Institute in Ponders End High Street for evening classes and social activities. Swan was the co-inventor with Thomas Edison of the electric light bulb and founder of the Edison Swan United Electric Light factory in Ponders End.<ref>London\u2019s Lea Valley by Jim Lewis</ref> In 1905 the building was purchased by Middlesex County Council for continuation of evening technical courses. The Institute was extended in 1911 with the opening of new buildings in the High Street and was now called the Ponders End Technical Institute, which included the newly opened day school, the Ponders End Trade School for boys age 13 to 16.\n\nThe new building included a large electrical testing laboratory and photometric optical room The Institute co-operated closely with the local electricity and gas industries in the provision of day and evening courses for workers in those trades. Another large local employer was the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock, an important supplier of small arms to the Government. Many of the apprentices recruited to the armaments factory came from the Trade School and it was in recognition of the demand for well-qualified recruits to the factory that the War Office gave \u00a3500 to the Institute for the new 1911 building. Middlesex County Council and Enfield Urban District Council provided the rest. The Trade School offered a two-year course for boys, including basic subjects in year one such as maths, English, history and geography, with mechanical drawing and metalwork. In the second year there were more specialised subjects, such as machine construction, mechanics, magnetism and electricity and building instruction.<ref>History of Enfield, Vol 3, David Pam</ref>\n\n'''Enfield Technical College and Junior Technical School: 1918\u20131944'''\n\nThe Trade School became the Junior Technical School after World War One. The Institute was extended in 1924 but the demand for day and evening courses required even greater expansion. In 1936 a 39-acre site in nearby Queensway was acquired. Building work commenced in 1938, and although it was not completed for several years due to the war, the Institute, now called the Enfield Technical College, together with the Junior Technical School, moved onto the new site in 1941. The College played an important role in fulfilling the national demand for trained technicians in the services and factories during World War Two.<ref>Schools of the Edmonton Hundred by GW Sturges</ref>\n\nAfter the war, with another name change to Enfield College of Technology, there was continued expansion, with recognition in 1959 from London University for courses leading to external degrees in engineering. In 1967, the college was reorganised into faculties for arts and technology acquiring more premises at Capel Manor and the rebuilt former Technical Institute in Ponders End. In 1973 it became part of Middlesex Polytechnic (later Middlesex University) until the University moved out of the area in 2008\n\n'''Junior Technical School to Secondary School: 1944\u20131987'''\n\nThe Junior Technical School meanwhile followed a different path and left the Queensway site in 1962 to new buildings in nearby Collinwood Avenue, the site of the present Enfield Centre although for a short period prior to this part of the school occupied some single level classrooms in the grounds of nearby Suffolks School in Brick Lane, Enfield Highway. It became the Ambrose Fleming technical grammar school for boys. Dr Ambrose Fleming, after whom the school was named, carried out research at the Ponders End Edison Swan factory which led to the diode lamp and the invention of the thermionic valve, a vital early component of radio and television.<ref>London\u2019s Lea Valley, Jim Lewis</ref> The main bias of the school was Applied Science and Technology, as well as general education, and it took boys from 11 to 18, leading to examinations in GCE O and A levels and Royal Society of Arts qualifications.  The school was reorganised as a comprehensive school for boys and girls in 1967. It increased in size, and new buildings were added in Collingwood Avenue in the 1970s.<ref>School Governing Body Minutes 1962\u20131984</ref> Then with falling rolls due to a decline in the school age population, Ambrose Fleming closed in 1987.\n\n'''Enfield College merges with CONEL: 1987 to present'''\n\nEnfield Further Education College moved onto the site and in August 2009 merged with the College of North East London (CONEL) to form the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n[[Bambos Charalambous]] - Labour MP  for Enfield Southgate, 2017- \n\n[[Bernie Grant|Bernie Grant MP]] \u2013 Labour MP for Tottenham, 1987\u20132000\n\n[[Audley Harrison]] \u2013 Boxer\n\n[[Robert Boyce|Robert Boyce (footballer)]] \u2013 Footballer\n\n[[Garth Crooks|Garth Crooks OBE]] \u2013 Footballer for [[Stoke City F.C.]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]]\n\n[[Jessie Wallace]] \u2013 [[EastEnders]] Actress\n\n[[Shystie|MC Shystie]] \u2013 [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]]-nominated rapper-songwriter and actress\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London}}\n*[http://www.conel.ac.uk/ The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London website]\n\n{{Universities and colleges in London}}\n{{Schools and colleges in Enfield}}\n{{Schools and colleges in Haringey}}\n{{coord|51.5862|-0.0723|type:edu_region:GB-HRY|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London}}\n[[Category:Further education colleges in London]]\n[[Category:Further education colleges in the Collab Group]]\n[[Category:Education in the London Borough of Enfield]]\n[[Category:Education in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2009]]\n[[Category:2009 in London]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Alumni of The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox college \n| name                  = The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London\n| image_name            =NelCollLogo.jpg\n| motto                 = Focus on Success\n| established           = 2009 (merged)\n| type                  = [[Further education]]\n| principal             = Andy Forbes MA (Cantab), PGCE, Dip Man.

Built in 1716 in 13 acres of wooded grounds it was the most southerly of a number of substantial country houses along Tottenham Green.<ref>Tottenham Education Week Handbook 1936</ref> In 1818 it was bought by the Society of Friends (Quakers) and opened in 1829 as a Quaker boarding school. Grove House School had a nationwide reputation and was noted for its advanced curriculum and absence of corporal punishment. It produced a number of distinguished alumni, including eleven future members of Parliament. One of these was WE Forster (1818\u20131886), a member of a local Tottenham Quaker family. He took the 1870 Education Act through Parliament, ensuring every child was entitled to at least an elementary education. Other well-known alumni included Dr Daniel Tuke (1827\u201395), an early mental health physician and Joseph Lister (1827\u20131912), a pioneer of antiseptic surgery.<ref>Schools of the Edmonton Hundred, GW Sturges</ref> Grove House School was one of several boarding schools in Tottenham with a nationwide reputation that were established from the late 17th century to the end of the 18th century. These included Bathsua Makin's \u2018school for gentlewomen\u2019 at Tottenham High Cross, and Bruce Castle School in Lordship Lane, established by the Hill family. One member of the Hill family was Sir Rowland Hill, who established the postal system by the introduction of the penny post.<ref>Tottenham: A History, Christine Protz</ref>\n\n'''Tottenham Polytechnic 1897\u20131936'''\n\nGrove House School closed in 1878 and from 1892 the building was used for classes in art, science and technical subjects. In 1897 it was purchased by Middlesex County Council, becoming Tottenham Polytechnic. In 1901 the Polytechnic shared accommodation with the newly opened Tottenham County School (see below), which used the Grove House premises during the day time. Polytechnic day classes were confined to the school of art, with science, technical and commercial studies largely taking place in the evening.\n\nIn 1909 the Polytechnic offered courses in art, physiology and hygiene, science, technology, building construction, plumbing and carpentry, as well as land surveying, bus routine and gas manufacture. The commercial department included the theory and practice of commerce, shorthand and typing, commercial geography and history.<ref>Committee for Higher Education in Tottenham, 1909</ref>\n\nIn 1910 additional buildings were constructed at the rear and the premises then comprised an assembly hall for up to 500 people, 11 classrooms, laboratories, dark room, art rooms and cookery rooms. The trade and industry courses had now expanded to include quantity surveying and mechanical engineering. There were also specialist classes in telegraphy and telephony taught by a GPO engineer, and gas supply, taught on the Gas Company premises by a gas works engineer. Particularly diverse were the commercial courses, which included commercial and industrial law, modern foreign languages (\u2018excellent teaching\u2019), shorthand and typing, banking, book keeping and accountancy. In addition to the Trade and Commercial courses, there were domestic classes in cookery, dressmaking and millinery.<ref>Board of Education Report, Tottenham Polytechnic 1911</ref>\n\nThis range of courses reflected the nature of Tottenham's population and industry at the time. Industry consisted mainly of many small engineering and manufacturing firms, together with the nascent gas and telephone companies. There was also a considerable amount of building work with a rapid development of houses, shops, commercial and civic buildings taking place in the district at this time. Tottenham's population was mainly residential, with clerks and professional workers commuting to the City and other nearby areas. The 1911 Report noted the difficulties faced by evening-class students who often did not arrive home from work until 7.30 or 8.00 pm. Nevertheless, by 1911 there were 1,191 evening students.\n\nIn 1913 the County School moved to its new building on Tottenham Green and the Polytechnic was able to expand by extending daytime courses. A day Junior Technical School offering a two-year course for students age 13 to 16 was opened. The junior day schools were enlarged again between the wars with a Junior Technical School for boys age 13\u201316 in building and allied trades and a Junior Commercial School for girls and boys age 13\u201316 offering a general education, together with office and clerical skills. These schools provided a secondary education that could lead to apprenticeships in industry or careers in business and the professions.<ref>Tottenham Education Week Handbook, 1936</ref>\n\nThere was also expansion in the third department of the Polytechnic, the Evening Institute, with four other centres across Tottenham being used. Classes were offered in art, science, matriculation, secretarial, accountancy and languages. There were courses in banking and the civil service, as well as technical and building work. The pioneering Blanche Nevile School for the Deaf, run by Tottenham Borough Council, was in nearby Philip Lane and the Polytechnic responded with classes in lip reading for teachers and parents, and language skills classes for deaf adults.<ref>Tottenham Polytechnic Prospectus 1923\u201324 (evening)</ref>\n\n'''The War Years and after: 1939\u20131970'''\n\n'''Tottenham Technical College'''\n\nStudent numbers rose from 857 in 1908-9 to 102,827 in 1938\u201339 <ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\">HMI Report 1950</ref> and rebuilding became a necessity. Grove House was demolished in 1936 <ref>Invitation to witness demolition of Grove House</ref> and the new building was opened in 1939. The Polytechnic was renamed Tottenham Technical College. The War disrupted work of the College, although courses continued to run, particularly as there was an urgent need for skilled labour in building and engineering. Part of the College was taken over by the Civil Defence, the control room for the Tottenham ARP (Air Raid Precautions) and the Auxiliary Fire Service, and normal work was frequently disrupted by air raids. In December 1940 a bomb damaged part of the recently built rear wing.<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/>\n[[File:Tottenham Technical college.jpg|alt=Tottenham Technical college|thumb|Tottenham Technical college]]\nAfter the war, College work began to get back on course. The two junior departments now came under the 1944 Education Act which established secondary education for all through a selective system. Pupils sat the 11 plus examination in the last year of primary education to decide whether they went to a grammar school, secondary modern, or one of the many varied intermediate schools, such as technical schools, introduced by different local education authorities. Tottenham's two junior colleges, more vocationally oriented than other schools, started at age 13, and access to their courses was through competitive examination. During the course of the 1960s, however, these two departments were gradually phased out with changes in secondary education.<ref>Tottenham College of Technology Opening of New Building 1973</ref>\n\nBy 1950, numbers had increased to 420,139 <ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/> and in 1955 a large extension was opened behind the main building to house the junior departments and technology department. In 1950, the College ran two main senior departments covering day and evening classes.<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/> The Department of Technology taught all aspects of building work and gas engineering and fitting. There were also classes in cabinet making, with the large furniture company Harris Lebus in Tottenham Hale being the biggest employer in the district. The Department of Commerce, established in 1945, ran degree courses in the evening for BA, BSc and BSc(Com) degrees. There were courses for Bankers, Auctioneers, Estate Agents, Local Government workers and Sales Managers, reflecting the high numbers of professional and middle-class workers in the locality. There were altogether 1,200 evening students in this department, with three main courses \u2013 professional, secretarial and general education. Day and evening classes were run offering secretarial, shorthand and typing courses, as well as general education. Apprentices from local industries attended general education classes as part of their day-release training.<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/>\n\nAdditional to the two main Departments, there were courses such as catering, cookery, dressmaking and Nursery Nurse training. The HMI report suggested these should be included in a Women's Department, especially as nearly half the students in the College, day and evening, were women (many of course in the Department of Commerce).<ref name=\"HMI Report 1950\"/> By 1955 a short-lived Department of Women's Studies had been established.<ref>Tottenham College of Technology Opening of New Building, 1973</ref>  By 1964, the College Departments had expanded to five; Science, Health, Hairdressing, Social Studies, Business Studies and Technology. Additional classes and workshops were run in Edmonton, in the Montagu Road Centre and Wilbury Way.<ref>Tottenham Technical College Prospectus 1964\u201365</ref>\n\n'''Tottenham College of Technology: 1970 \u2013 1990'''\n\nFollowing local government reorganisation in 1965, the College transferred to the London Borough of Haringey. Shortly after, the Council designated a site adjacent to the College for extensions to accommodate increasing numbers and replace the two College sites in Edmonton, now part of Enfield Council. Three new blocks were opened in 1973, joined to each other and to the existing building by means of a bridge at first floor level. A second phase Tower Block was also planned. The College now became Tottenham College of Technology, and its five Departments were reorganised into Department of Building, Department of Business and Administration Studies, Department of Health, Hairdressing and Floristry, Department of Mechanical Services and Engineering and Department of Public Health and Science.<ref>Tottenham College of Technology Opening of New Building 1970</ref>\n\n'''Merger leads to creation of The College of North East London in 1990'''\n\nIn April 1990, Tottenham College of technology merged with Haringey College to become the College of North East London. In January 1991 Adult Education also joined the College making a large and very diverse institution on seven sites spread across the Borough of Haringey.\n\n'''Incorporation \u2013 1993'''\n\nOn 1 April 1993, like every other maintained college in the country, The College of North East London became a corporation. It ceased to be maintained by the London Borough of Haringey and became an independent institution employing over 700 staff, owning its premises and funded by government via the Further Education Funding Council. During the summer of 1993 major refurbishment took place. The Department of Environmental Health and Public administration moved to Bounds Green centre, Art and Design moved to Muswell Hill Centre and the Department of Business and Computing Studied was concentrated at Tottenham Centre. The Hairdressing and Beauty Therapy salons were refurbished and new computer suites created in the Tower Block.\n\n'''1997 \u2013 Present'''\n\nIn 1997, the Tottenham Centre celebrated its centenary and in 2000, completed a new entrance and ground floor extension named the Centenary Building.\n\n'''Tottenham Green'''\n\n'''Early Years in the Polytechnic 1901\u20131913'''\n\nThis site, built in 1913, is based in the former Tottenham County School. The County School was established by Middlesex County Council in 1901 as its first co-educational selective grammar school, and it was one of the first in the country. There were concerns that mixed gender education would be a challenging environment for girls and that boys would be held back. However, the headmaster Mr CH Peters noted that the fear of many parents regarding mixed education proved groundless <ref>MCC Minutes of Tottenham Polytechnic October 1901</ref> and when His Majesty's Inspector's visited in 1902, they generally agreed that a mixed school was positive.<ref>MCC Minutes of Committee of Tottenham Polytechnic February 1902</ref> The County School was first based in Grove House when it was the home of Tottenham Polytechnic (see above), and the history of the two institutions have been connected from the beginning. The County School, in spite of its temporary premises, got off to a good start as recorded by HMI reports. Numbers on roll started around 80, but reached 141 by the end of the year, 69 of whom were girls and 72 boys. The pupils came from a wide area, as well as Tottenham, including Edmonton, Waltham Cross, Hornsey, Wood Green, Finsbury Park, Stoke Newington, Shoreditch and Hackney.<ref>MCC Minutes of Committee of Tottenham Polytechnic October 1902</ref> As a secondary grammar school, it was fee paying with charges of 31s6d a term, although following the 1907 Education Act some free places were reserved for successful scholarship entrants from state elementary schools\n\n'''The County School on the Green 1913\u20131963'''\n\nIn 1913 the school moved to the new building on Tottenham Green. It is part of a parade of Edwardian former Civic buildings on the east side of Tottenham Green which once included the Town Hall, swimming baths and fire station. These are now occupied by small businesses and voluntary organisations, and include the Bernie Grant Arts Centre. Tottenham Green itself, from Philip Lane to the former Grove House, on both sides of the High Road, was once the location of 17th and 18th century mansion houses occupied by the Tottenham gentry of the time, many of whom were Quakers. A number of the gentry living here played a significant part in national and international affairs, including education, the abolition of the slave trade, and social reform such as the opening of the first Penny Savings Bank by local Quaker, Priscilla Wakefield.<ref>Tottenham: A History, by Christine Protz; The Quakers of Tottenham 1775\u20131825 by R Collie</ref>\n\nDuring the years in which it was based at the Polytechnic, Tottenham County School numbers rose to around 400. The new building on Tottenham Green had spaces for 450, but by 1936, the numbers had reached 543 <ref>Victoria County History, Middlesex vol v</ref> due to rising numbers of children in the local population. They dropped dramatically during the War, when the school was evacuated to March, Cambridgeshire, in September 1939. In August 1940 half the evacuees returned to continue their education and the school re-opened on 9 September 1940. The Blitz had, however, started and return was delayed due to an unexploded bomb on Tottenham Green. When the school did commence work, staff and students had to share their premises with the ARP (Air Raid Precautions) and the Food Office. Students and teachers were confined to three rooms on the top floor, but nevertheless were able to present a full form for GCE examinations. Eventually, the ARP and Food Office moved out to other accommodation, and the rest of the school returned in September 1942, continuing their studies as best they could with the continuous interruptions of air raids day and night.<ref>Tottenham County School Chronicle 1944</ref>\n\nAfter the War numbers at the school continued to increase, reaching 658 in 1953. Extra space was found in nearby High Cross Memorial Hall and new buildings were planned at Selby Road, Devonshire Hill. These were occupied in 1963, but Tottenham County School closed in 1967 with the reorganisation of all Haringey Secondary schools into comprehensives. It became Tottenham School.<ref>Tottenham County School Chronicle, December 1963</ref>\n\n'''After the County School 1963\u2013Present Day'''\n\nThe Tottenham Green building continued to be used for education in the years since. In 1970 it was used by Moselle school, a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties, until its move to new buildings in Adams Road in 1973. Another new school starting life in this building was Northumberland Park Community School, which opened in 1972. It later moved to new accommodation in Trulock Road, Northumberland Park.<ref>Victoria County History, Middlesex, Vol V</ref>\n\n'''Enfield Centre'''\n\n'''Electronics and Armaments: 1901\u20131918'''\n\nThe history of the Enfield Centre can be traced back to 1901, when Sir Joseph Swan opened the Ediswan Institute in Ponders End High Street for evening classes and social activities. Swan was the co-inventor with Thomas Edison of the electric light bulb and founder of the Edison Swan United Electric Light factory in Ponders End.<ref>London\u2019s Lea Valley by Jim Lewis</ref> In 1905 the building was purchased by Middlesex County Council for continuation of evening technical courses. The Institute was extended in 1911 with the opening of new buildings in the High Street and was now called the Ponders End Technical Institute, which included the newly opened day school, the Ponders End Trade School for boys age 13 to 16.\n\nThe new building included a large electrical testing laboratory and photometric optical room The Institute co-operated closely with the local electricity and gas industries in the provision of day and evening courses for workers in those trades. Another large local employer was the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock, an important supplier of small arms to the Government. Many of the apprentices recruited to the armaments factory came from the Trade School and it was in recognition of the demand for well-qualified recruits to the factory that the War Office gave \u00a3500 to the Institute for the new 1911 building. Middlesex County Council and Enfield Urban District Council provided the rest. The Trade School offered a two-year course for boys, including basic subjects in year one such as maths, English, history and geography, with mechanical drawing and metalwork. In the second year there were more specialised subjects, such as machine construction, mechanics, magnetism and electricity and building instruction.<ref>History of Enfield, Vol 3, David Pam</ref>\n\n'''Enfield Technical College and Junior Technical School: 1918\u20131944'''\n\nThe Trade School became the Junior Technical School after World War One. The Institute was extended in 1924 but the demand for day and evening courses required even greater expansion. In 1936 a 39-acre site in nearby Queensway was acquired. Building work commenced in 1938, and although it was not completed for several years due to the war, the Institute, now called the Enfield Technical College, together with the Junior Technical School, moved onto the new site in 1941. The College played an important role in fulfilling the national demand for trained technicians in the services and factories during World War Two.<ref>Schools of the Edmonton Hundred by GW Sturges</ref>\n\nAfter the war, with another name change to Enfield College of Technology, there was continued expansion, with recognition in 1959 from London University for courses leading to external degrees in engineering. In 1967, the college was reorganised into faculties for arts and technology acquiring more premises at Capel Manor and the rebuilt former Technical Institute in Ponders End. In 1973 it became part of Middlesex Polytechnic (later Middlesex University) until the University moved out of the area in 2008\n\n'''Junior Technical School to Secondary School: 1944\u20131987'''\n\nThe Junior Technical School meanwhile followed a different path and left the Queensway site in 1962 to new buildings in nearby Collinwood Avenue, the site of the present Enfield Centre although for a short period prior to this part of the school occupied some single level classrooms in the grounds of nearby Suffolks School in Brick Lane, Enfield Highway. It became the Ambrose Fleming technical grammar school for boys. Dr Ambrose Fleming, after whom the school was named, carried out research at the Ponders End Edison Swan factory which led to the diode lamp and the invention of the thermionic valve, a vital early component of radio and television.<ref>London\u2019s Lea Valley, Jim Lewis</ref> The main bias of the school was Applied Science and Technology, as well as general education, and it took boys from 11 to 18, leading to examinations in GCE O and A levels and Royal Society of Arts qualifications.  The school was reorganised as a comprehensive school for boys and girls in 1967. It increased in size, and new buildings were added in Collingwood Avenue in the 1970s.<ref>School Governing Body Minutes 1962\u20131984</ref> Then with falling rolls due to a decline in the school age population, Ambrose Fleming closed in 1987.\n\n'''Enfield College merges with CONEL: 1987 to present'''\n\nEnfield Further Education College moved onto the site and in August 2009 merged with the College of North East London (CONEL) to form the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n[[Bambos Charalambous]] - Labour MP  for Enfield Southgate, 2017- \n\n[[Bernie Grant|Bernie Grant MP]] \u2013 Labour MP for Tottenham, 1987\u20132000\n\n[[Audley Harrison]] \u2013 Boxer\n\n[[Robert Boyce|Robert Boyce (footballer)]] \u2013 Footballer\n\n[[Garth Crooks|Garth Crooks OBE]] \u2013 Footballer for [[Stoke City F.C.]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]]\n\n[[Jessie Wallace]] \u2013 [[EastEnders]] Actress\n\n[[Shystie|MC Shystie]] \u2013 [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]]-nominated rapper-songwriter and actress\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London}}\n*[http://www.conel.ac.uk/ The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London website]\n\n{{Universities and colleges in London}}\n{{Schools and colleges in Enfield}}\n{{Schools and colleges in Haringey}}\n{{coord|51.5862|-0.0723|type:edu_region:GB-HRY|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London}}\n[[Category:Further education colleges in London]]\n[[Category:Further education colleges in the Collab Group]]\n[[Category:Education in the London Borough of Enfield]]\n[[Category:Education in the London Borough of Haringey]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2009]]\n[[Category:2009 in London]]\n[[Category:2009 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Alumni of The College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1908-9 \u2192 1908\u20139", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_of_Haringey,_Enfield_and_North_East_London"}
