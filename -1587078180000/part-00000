12 January 1893&nbsp;\u2013 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] hours before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry, Garrison: [[Mulhouse|M\u00fclhausen]]) of the [[Prussian Army]] in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; G\u00f6ring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, G\u00f6ring was stationed at [[M\u00fclhausen]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{stack|[[File:G\u00f6ring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of G\u00f6ring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, G\u00f6ring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[M\u00fclhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of [[trench warfare]]. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, G\u00f6ring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&nbsp;\u2013 G\u00f6ring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, G\u00f6ring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both G\u00f6ring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Nicola Perscheid - Hermann G\u00f6ring um 1918.jpg|upright|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring as a fighter pilot in 1917]]\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, G\u00f6ring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion|Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201332}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, G\u00f6ring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nOn 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], G\u00f6ring was made commander of the \"Flying Circus\", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201333}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}\n\nIn the last days of the war, G\u00f6ring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34\u201336}}\n\nLike many other German veterans, G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}\n\n== After World War I ==\n\nG\u00f6ring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. G\u00f6ring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920\u20131921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, G\u00f6ring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39\u201341}}{{efn|name=swastika}}\n\nThis was also the first time that G\u00f6ring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin G\u00f6ring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''n\u00e9e'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. G\u00f6ring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when G\u00f6ring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed G\u00f6ring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After G\u00f6ring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}\n\n== Early Nazi career ==\n[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|right|upright=1.0|thumb|G\u00f6ring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-F\u00fchrer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin\u2014who liked Hitler\u2014often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with G\u00f6ring:\n\n{{quote|text=I liked him. I made him the head of my SA. He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly. I gave him a dishevelled rabble. In a very short time he had organised a division of 11,000 men.{{sfn|Hitler|1988|p=168}}|sign=Adolf Hitler|source=}}\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=49\u201351}} Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]], the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8\u20139 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. G\u00f6ring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the groin.{{sfn|Holland|2011|p=54}} Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, G\u00f6ring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=57\u201358}} This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=644}} Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared G\u00f6ring a wanted man. The G\u00f6rings\u2014acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad\u2014moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. G\u00f6ring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59\u201360}}\n\nPersonal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The G\u00f6rings\u2014with difficulty\u2014raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gda\u0144sk). G\u00f6ring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

G\u00f6ring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella.

The province of [[Styria]] had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met the Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] on 12 February 1938, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming.  The Nazi Party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, G\u00f6ring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members.

Everyone present, including G\u00f6ring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray G\u00f6ring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} When testifying on his own behalf, G\u00f6ring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359\u2013367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H.

leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] hours before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry, Garrison: [[Mulhouse|M\u00fclhausen]]) of the [[Prussian Army]] in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; G\u00f6ring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, G\u00f6ring was stationed at [[M\u00fclhausen]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{stack|[[File:G\u00f6ring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of G\u00f6ring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, G\u00f6ring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[M\u00fclhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of [[trench warfare]]. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, G\u00f6ring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&nbsp;\u2013 G\u00f6ring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, G\u00f6ring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both G\u00f6ring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Nicola Perscheid - Hermann G\u00f6ring um 1918.jpg|upright|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring as a fighter pilot in 1917]]\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, G\u00f6ring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion|Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201332}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, G\u00f6ring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nOn 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], G\u00f6ring was made commander of the \"Flying Circus\", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201333}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}\n\nIn the last days of the war, G\u00f6ring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34\u201336}}\n\nLike many other German veterans, G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}\n\n== After World War I ==\n\nG\u00f6ring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. G\u00f6ring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920\u20131921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, G\u00f6ring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39\u201341}}{{efn|name=swastika}}\n\nThis was also the first time that G\u00f6ring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin G\u00f6ring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''n\u00e9e'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. G\u00f6ring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when G\u00f6ring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed G\u00f6ring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After G\u00f6ring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}\n\n== Early Nazi career ==\n[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|right|upright=1.0|thumb|G\u00f6ring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-F\u00fchrer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945.

G\u00f6ring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of G\u00f6ring; her son was taken by his father.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

On 18 October, Hitler named G\u00f6ring as [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] to undertake this task. G\u00f6ring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella.

Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met the Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] on 12 February 1938, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming.  The Nazi Party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March.

By this time, G\u00f6ring's hunting lodge [[Carinhall]] had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} G\u00f6ring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that G\u00f6ring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1115\u20131116}}\n\nOKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified G\u00f6ring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify G\u00f6ring of this development. A week after the start of the Soviet invasion, Hitler had issued a decree naming G\u00f6ring his successor in the event of his death, thus codifying the declaration he had made soon after the beginning of the war. The decree also gave G\u00f6ring full authority to act as Hitler's deputy if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1115\u20131116}}\n\nG\u00f6ring feared being branded a traitor if he tried to take power, but also feared being accused of dereliction of duty if he did nothing. After some hesitation, G\u00f6ring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]] (the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery), G\u00f6ring concluded that by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that under the terms of the decree, it was incumbent upon G\u00f6ring to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, G\u00f6ring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}\n\n[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann G\u00f6ring.ogv|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring after his capture (May 1945)]]\n\nThe telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that G\u00f6ring was a traitor. Bormann argued that G\u00f6ring's telegram was not a request for permission to act as Hitler's deputy, but a demand to resign or be overthrown.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}} Bormann also intercepted another telegram in which G\u00f6ring directed Ribbentrop to report to him if there was no further communication from Hitler or G\u00f6ring before midnight.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=608\u2013609}} Hitler sent a reply to G\u00f6ring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}rescinding the 1941 decree and threatening him with execution for high treason unless he immediately resigned from all of his offices. G\u00f6ring duly resigned. Afterwards, Hitler (or Bormann, depending on the source) ordered the SS to place G\u00f6ring, his staff, and Lammers under house arrest at Obersalzberg.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}} Bormann made an announcement over the radio that G\u00f6ring had resigned for health reasons.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=318}}\n\nBy 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg [[Bombing of Obersalzberg|was under attack]] by the Allies, so G\u00f6ring was moved to [[Burg Mauterndorf|his castle at Mauterndorf]]. In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled G\u00f6ring from the party, formally rescinded the decree making him his successor, and upbraided G\u00f6ring for \"illegally attempting to seize control of the state.\"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1126}} He then appointed [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, [[Eva Braun]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. G\u00f6ring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near [[Radstadt]] on 6 May by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=320\u2013325}} This move likely saved G\u00f6ring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}}{{clear left}}\n\n== Trial and death ==\n[[File:G\u00f6ring Detention Report mugshots.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Prisoner's \"mug shot\" taken at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice|alt=]]\n\n{{main|Nuremberg trials}}\n\nG\u00f6ring was flown to [[Camp Ashcan]], a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at [[Mondorf-les-Bains]], Luxembourg.

Everyone present, including G\u00f6ring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray G\u00f6ring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} When testifying on his own behalf, G\u00f6ring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359\u2013367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H.

The \"symmetry factor\" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions. The \"forbidden thoughts factor\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \"cleaning factor\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The \"hoarding factor\" only involved hoarding-related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532\u201342|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}</ref>\n\nWhile OCD has been considered a homogeneous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders. Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response. Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.

Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean?

For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.\n\n=== Insight ===\nThe DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name=\"Sadock\">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Overvalued ideas ===\nSome people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially.

To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name=\"Quick\">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.\n\nCompulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.\n\nMoreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name=\"Quick\" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name=\"Fenske_2009\" />\n\nOCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55\u201360|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nOCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD).

OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]\u2014marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.\n\nAs a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.<ref name=\"carter\">Carter, K. \"Obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder.\" PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University.

At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \"contaminated\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \"contaminated\" location, such as a school). That is the \"exposure\". The \"ritual prevention\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[Habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more \"contaminated\" or not checking the lock at all\u2014again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.<ref name=\"baojournal.com\">Huppert & Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention.

These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process.

The \"forbidden thoughts factor\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \"cleaning factor\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning.

Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.

Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean?

For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.\n\n=== Insight ===\nThe DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name=\"Sadock\">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Overvalued ideas ===\nSome people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially.

To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name=\"Quick\">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.\n\nCompulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.\n\nMoreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name=\"Quick\" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name=\"Fenske_2009\" />\n\nOCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55\u201360|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nOCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD).

At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \"contaminated\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \"contaminated\" location, such as a school). That is the \"exposure\". The \"ritual prevention\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention).

When Phaedrus asks what one should call such a man, Socrates, following [[Heraclitus]], replies that the term ''sophos'', one who knows, would be excessive: this attribute may be applied to God alone: but one might well call him ''[[philosopher|philosophos]]'', a lover of wisdom. Thus in the classic sense and reference of 'philosophy', actual knowledge is reserved to God; finite man can only be the lover of knowledge, not himself the one who possesses knowledge. In the meaning of the passage, the lover of the knowledge that belongs only to the knowing God, the ''philosophos'', becomes the ''theophilos'', the lover of God.\"<ref>Eric Voegelin, ''Science, Politics, and Gnosticism (ISI Books {{ISBN|1-932236-48-1}}), p. 41</ref>\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn [[Hinduism]], in contrast to k\u0101ma, which is selfish, or pleasurable love, prema \u2013 or prem \u2013 refers to elevated love. Karuna is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term, meaning \"loving devotion to the supreme God\". A person who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of bhakti, which can be found in the Bhagavata Purana and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work Narada Bhakti Sutras, written by an unknown author (presumed to be Narada), distinguishes eleven forms of love.\n\nOn the mystic side of Hinduism, one of the forms of [[Yoga]] includes [[Ishvarapranidhana]], or self-surrender to God, and his worship.\n\n===Bhakti movements===\n{{main|Bhakti yoga}}\n{{see also|Svayam Bhagavan|Krishnaism}}\nDevotees of [[Krishna]] worship him in different emotional, transcendental raptures, known as ''[[rasa (theology)|rasas]]''. Two major systems of Krishna worship developed, each with its own philosophical system. These two systems are ''aishwaryamaya bhakti'' and ''madhuryamaya bhakti''. ''Aishwaryamaya bhakti'' is revealed in the abode of queens and kingdom of Krishna in [[Dv\u0101rak\u0101|Dwaraka]]. ''Madhuryamaya Bhakti'' is revealed in the abode of ''[[Braja]]''. Thus Krishna is variously worshipped according to the development of devotee's taste in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, as father, friend, master, beloved and many different varieties which are all extraordinary. Krishna is famous as ''Makhanchor'', or butter thief. He loved to eat butter and is the beloved of his little village in [[Gokul]]. These are all transcendental descriptions. Thus they are revealed to the sincere devotees in proportion to the development in their love of Godhead. [[Vaishnavism]] is a form of [[monotheism]], sometimes described as '[[polymorphic monotheism]]', with implication that there are many forms of one original deity, defined as belief in a single unitary deity who takes many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity \u2013 as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of [[Narayana]] or [[Vishnu]].<ref>Scheweig, (2004) pp. 13\u201317</ref> It may refer to either of the interrelated concepts of the love of God towards creation, the love of creatures towards God or relationship between the two as in [[bhakti]].\n\n==Islam==\nThe love of God, and the [[Fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], are two of the foundations of [[Islam]]. The highest spiritual attainment in Islam is related to the love of God. \"Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides God, as equal (with God): They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God.\" (Quran 2:165)Another Islamic concept is that God's love leads towards good deeds \"And feed with food the needy, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (ie. God).\"\n\nIslam, as Christianity, has numerous [[mysticism|mystics]] and traditions about the love of God, as in:\n\n:\"O lovers! The religion of the love of God is not found in Islam alone.\n:In the realm of love, there is neither belief, nor unbelief.\" ([[Rumi]])<ref>Rumi's Quatrain no. 768, translated by Gamard & Farhadi. Versions of this quatrain have been made by Shahram Shiva, \"Hush: Don't Tell God\", p. 17 and by Azima Kolin (based on Mafi), \"Rumi: Whispers of the Beloved\", p. 71. [`\u00e2shiq to yaq\u00een d\u00e2n, ke musulm\u00e2n na-b\u00fbd dar maZhab-\u00e9 `ishq, kufr-o \u00eem\u00e2n na-b\u00fbd]</ref>\n\nThe concept of Divine Love, known as ''Ishq-e-Haqeeqi'' ([[Persian_language|Persian]]), is elaborated by many great Muslim saints to date. Some Sufi writers and poets may have taken human love as a metaphor to define Divine Love but the prominent mystics explain the concept in its entirety and reveal its hardcore reality.

[[Socrates]] famously asked whether this identification is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (see ''[[Euthyphro dilemma]]'').\n\n===\"Philotheos\" and \"theophilos\"===\nIn [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111163 philotheos]'' means \"loving God, pious\", as ''[[philosopher|philosophos]]'' means a lover of wisdom (''sophia''). {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|3:4}}, using the word ''philotheos'' in the plural form, speaks of certain people as \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f22 \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03b9 (lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God). The word ''[[Theophilus (disambiguation)|Theophilos]]'' was and is used as a proper name, but does not appear as an adjective or common noun in Greek,<ref>The word does not appear in the great [[Liddell and Scott|Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon]]</ref> which uses instead the form ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2348342 theophil\u00eas,]'' which means \"dear to God\" but also \"loving God\".\n\nHowever, [[Eric Voegelin]] used ''theophilos'' to mean \"lover of God\": \"In the ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] describe the characteristics of the true thinker. When Phaedrus asks what one should call such a man, Socrates, following [[Heraclitus]], replies that the term ''sophos'', one who knows, would be excessive: this attribute may be applied to God alone: but one might well call him ''[[philosopher|philosophos]]'', a lover of wisdom. Thus in the classic sense and reference of 'philosophy', actual knowledge is reserved to God; finite man can only be the lover of knowledge, not himself the one who possesses knowledge. In the meaning of the passage, the lover of the knowledge that belongs only to the knowing God, the ''philosophos'', becomes the ''theophilos'', the lover of God.\"<ref>Eric Voegelin, ''Science, Politics, and Gnosticism (ISI Books {{ISBN|1-932236-48-1}}), p. 41</ref>\n\n==Hinduism==\nIn [[Hinduism]], in contrast to k\u0101ma, which is selfish, or pleasurable love, prema \u2013 or prem \u2013 refers to elevated love. Karuna is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term, meaning \"loving devotion to the supreme God\". A person who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of bhakti, which can be found in the Bhagavata Purana and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work Narada Bhakti Sutras, written by an unknown author (presumed to be Narada), distinguishes eleven forms of love.\n\nOn the mystic side of Hinduism, one of the forms of [[Yoga]] includes [[Ishvarapranidhana]], or self-surrender to God, and his worship.\n\n===Bhakti movements===\n{{main|Bhakti yoga}}\n{{see also|Svayam Bhagavan|Krishnaism}}\nDevotees of [[Krishna]] worship him in different emotional, transcendental raptures, known as ''[[rasa (theology)|rasas]]''. Two major systems of Krishna worship developed, each with its own philosophical system. These two systems are ''aishwaryamaya bhakti'' and ''madhuryamaya bhakti''. ''Aishwaryamaya bhakti'' is revealed in the abode of queens and kingdom of Krishna in [[Dv\u0101rak\u0101|Dwaraka]]. ''Madhuryamaya Bhakti'' is revealed in the abode of ''[[Braja]]''. Thus Krishna is variously worshipped according to the development of devotee's taste in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, as father, friend, master, beloved and many different varieties which are all extraordinary. Krishna is famous as ''Makhanchor'', or butter thief. He loved to eat butter and is the beloved of his little village in [[Gokul]]. These are all transcendental descriptions. Thus they are revealed to the sincere devotees in proportion to the development in their love of Godhead. [[Vaishnavism]] is a form of [[monotheism]], sometimes described as '[[polymorphic monotheism]]', with implication that there are many forms of one original deity, defined as belief in a single unitary deity who takes many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity \u2013 as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of [[Narayana]] or [[Vishnu]].<ref>Scheweig, (2004) pp. 13\u201317</ref> It may refer to either of the interrelated concepts of the love of God towards creation, the love of creatures towards God or relationship between the two as in [[bhakti]].\n\n==Islam==\nThe love of God, and the [[Fear of God (religion)|fear of God]], are two of the foundations of [[Islam]]. The highest spiritual attainment in Islam is related to the love of God. \"Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides God, as equal (with God): They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God.\" (Quran 2:165)Another Islamic concept is that God's love leads towards good deeds \"And feed with food the needy, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (ie. God).\"\n\nIslam, as Christianity, has numerous [[mysticism|mystics]] and traditions about the love of God, as in:\n\n:\"O lovers! The religion of the love of God is not found in Islam alone.\n:In the realm of love, there is neither belief, nor unbelief.\" ([[Rumi]])<ref>Rumi's Quatrain no. 768, translated by Gamard & Farhadi. Versions of this quatrain have been made by Shahram Shiva, \"Hush: Don't Tell God\", p. 17 and by Azima Kolin (based on Mafi), \"Rumi: Whispers of the Beloved\", p. 71. [`\u00e2shiq to yaq\u00een d\u00e2n, ke musulm\u00e2n na-b\u00fbd dar maZhab-\u00e9 `ishq, kufr-o \u00eem\u00e2n na-b\u00fbd]</ref>\n\nThe concept of Divine Love, known as ''Ishq-e-Haqeeqi'' ([[Persian_language|Persian]]), is elaborated by many great Muslim saints to date. Some Sufi writers and poets may have taken human love as a metaphor to define Divine Love but the prominent mystics explain the concept in its entirety and reveal its hardcore reality.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

The community is located along Meeker County Road 2 near its junction with State Highway 24 ([[Minnesota State Highway 24|MN 24]]).  The North Fork of the [[Crow River (Minnesota)|Crow River]] flows nearby.\n\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 181\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |author=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\nIn the late spring or early summer of 1855, John W. Huy, Benjamin Brown, and someone named Mackenzie, all employed by a St. Paul lumber company, paddled a canoe up the Crow River to the Minnesota Territory\u2019s west-central area, the Big Woods, in search of pine timber.  Not satisfied with their findings, they returned to St. Paul, but Huy organized another exploring party, consisting of a young lawyer named D. M. Hanson (called the first Swede to visit the area), Dr. Thomas H. Skinner, and Rudolph Schultz (1825-1910).  Late that summer, the explorers took off for the same area and in the fall they stopped in what is now Harvey Township.  There they planned to start a new town and call it Kar-i-shon, [[Sioux]] for \u201ccrow\u201d, which is what the Indians called the area.  But, for some reason, they moved on to the present day Forest City area where they met Dr. [[Frederick Noah Ripley]].  They preferred this area, so Schultz and Huy made a dugout house on the banks of the Crow River where it made a junction with a creek, (section 13 of Harvey Township), and Huy stayed in it through the following winter to make a claim on the land.  He thus became the first permanent white resident of the county.  The others, except for Dr. Ripley, returned to St. Paul where Hanson went before the legislature and urged them to create a new county, which would include the area he had just visited.\n\nThe legislature complied and established Meeker County on February 23, 1856.  The county was named in honor of Bradley B. Meeker (1813 -1873) of Minneapolis, who had been an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1849 to 1853.  Early in 1856, the settlers in Forest City were Milton C. Moore and Elijah Bemis (b.1812).  Moore became Meeker County\u2019s first Register of Deeds and Bemis became the county\u2019s first sheriff.  James Benjamin Atkinson, Sr. (b.1822) opened the first store in Forest City on March 1, 1857.  It was also the first in the county.  In 1862, Atkinson took on a partner, Mark W. Piper, who ran the store starting in October 1863 while Atkinson enlisted to serve in the Union Army.  In 1866, after Capt. Atkinson returned, Piper sold his half back to him and Atkinson ran it until 1879.\n\nD. M. Hanson and John W. Huy, who were appointed county commissioners, met in the newly started Forest City on May 6, 1856, and organized the county on paper.  Ripley, another appointed commissioner, was to have joined them, but he had frozen to death on March 3, 1856, by the lake in Litchfield that hence bore his name.  William S. Chapman found Ripley\u2019s body later in that spring.  With the nearby Crow River for transportation, more and more people gravitated to Forest City.  It was named the county seat because it had a river for shipping goods.  The addition of the railroad through Litchfield changed the population makeup of the county.   A referendum was held and, with the difference of only eighty-nine votes, they changed the county seat to Litchfield.  So, Litchfield had the courthouse that was in Forest City.  The old Forest City Courthouse was moved to 15 East Fifth Street in Litchfield in 1870.  Litchfield Village Council President Jesse Vawter Branham, Jr. owned the building and he leased it out residential because the city decided it was too small for a courthouse.   After all, it was only a small wooden house painted white.   Many of the buildings in Forest City became buildings in Litchfield.  One of those was F. G. Alvord\u2019s blacksmith shop.\n\nOther new settlers to Forest City in 1856 were Walter C. Bacon, James Bramhall, Henry Clinton, Charles E. Cutts, Wait H. Dart, Isaac C. Delamater, Edward Fitzgerald, John Flynn, John W. Griswold, Loring Huy, Thomas Carlos Jewett (came on June 20 and was the postmaster in 1863), John W. Johnson, John Kimball, Charles McAron, David Mitchell. Mitchell, who had traveled from Maine by covered wagon with his pregnant wife Belinda was representative of settlers who traveled considerable distance to their new home. Additionally, John Patterson, John A. Quick, Rev. John Robson, Wyman Ryan, Charles N. Shed, Mathew Miles Standish, Judson A. Stanton, Samuel and Dudley Taylor, George O. Thomas, Ogden T. Tuttle, William H. Van Ness, Leander L. Wakefield, Jacob Weymer, Joseph Weymer, Sr., John Whalen, and John Wigis were early arrivals..   The first 4 July celebration took place in Forest City in 1856.  On June 22, Rudolph Schultz, Charles Johnson, and James W. Quick brought a large tree pole out of the woods and raised it in Forest City.  A small tin pan was washed and nailed on the top of the pole and the flag was raised up to it.  The U. S. flag was made from a white cotton shirt furnished by Thomas Carlos Jewett (1827-1900), some red flannel underwear given by Sgt. Matthew Miles Standish (1833-1864), and a blue denim overall offered by John W. Huy. What took place at the actual 4 July celebration was never recorded.\n\nSarah Jane Dougherty, daughter of Thomas Dougherty, was born in a covered wagon in Forest City on July 15, 1856, and she has been called the first white child born in Meeker County. She died in 1952.  The first post office in Meeker County was started in Forest City on October 4, 1856, with Walter C. Bacon as the postmaster.  He was succeeded by James B. Atkinson, Sr.  The post office remained in operation until 1907.  The first death reported was Frank Parsons on November 12, 1856.  The first religious service was by a Methodist minister, Rev. John Robson, Jr., in November 1856.  Rev. Thomas Hardwood was the first permanent pastor.\n\nNew settlers in 1857 were Henderson Marsh Angier, James B. Atkinson, H. N. Baker, Jacob Ball, Gilbert M. Blandin, Benjamin F. Butler, W. S Chapman, David Poster Delamater (1828-1907), Milton Gorton, Thomas Grayson, N. O. Griffin, L. F. Haines, A. F. Heath, John Heath, Azro B. Hoyt, Jacob Knapp, Michael Lenhart, John and Michael Murray, Isaac Perrine, William Richards, Hamlet Stevens, John Sullivan, Allen Teachout, H. S. Walker, Charles and William Willis, James Willis, and W. W. Woodman.  Forest City was platted in 1857 and was named for its location near the Big Woods. The first Catholic mass in Meeker County was in the plain cabin home of John Flynn and it was officiated by Rev. Father Alexius in 1857.  Two years later, Father Benedict administered the last rites of the church to one of Forest City\u2019s first settlers.  Father Benedict has been memorialized by one of the windows in the Church of St. Gertrude. Dudley Taylor and his wife operated the first hotel.  It was a large log building. The first schoolhouse (District 2) was built in 1857.  W. W. Woodman was employed to build it at a cost of $250.  The first teacher was Thomas Carlos Jewett.  A creek in Litchfield was named after Jewett, who came to Meeker County on June 20, 1856.  At different times, Jewett was the Meeker County Sheriff, the registrar of deeds, a Justice of the Peace, and a United States Commissioner to Alaska, appointed by Grover Cleveland.\n\nThere were another 20 settlers who came in 1858 when Minnesota had just become a state. In 1858, John Robson built the first steam-powered sawmill near the village.  Fitch and Stanton opened a store than he ran from 1858 to 1862.  J. A. Baird had a brickyard (the first in the county) briefly in 1858.  Thomas H. Skinner started a store in 1862. When the Sioux attacked in August 1862, Jesse, V. Branham, Sr., at the age of fifty-nine, was the only person, of the six hundred assembled in Forest City, to volunteer to ride his horse to St. Paul to get help.  That\u2019s about a hundred miles or more on horseback.  His son, Jesse V. Branham, Jr., was a scout with Capt. Richard Strout and it was Jr.\u2019s idea to build the stockade at Forest City.  While his father rode to St. Paul, Jesse, Jr. rode around the county, like Paul Revere, alerting settlers that the Indians were attacking.\n\nOn August 17th, on Branham\u2019s ride, during the skirmish with the Indians, Jesse, Jr. had stopped to reload his rifle and he was shot in the chest.  The bullet passed through his lungs and came out his back.  He never fell and he was able to walk instead to his team of horses and go for help.  He rode without medical attention for eight hours until he reached Hutchinson.  Jesse collapsed at a farmhouse. The wound was cleaned by running a silk handkerchief entirely through Jesse\u2019s body before the doctor, who was summoned, came. \u201cI can do nothing for this man,\u201d the doctor said, after taking one look at Jesse.  \u201cMake him as comfortable as you can.  He\u2019ll be dead in three hours.\u201d  Obviously, he was wrong.  Branham survived and became Litchfield\u2019s first Village Council President.\n\nThe stockade had been begun before the uprising, but it wasn\u2019t quite finished when the Indians had begun attacking the settlers.  Luckily, the majority of the stockade went up in one day, on September 3.  There were logs close by that were going to be used to build the Forest City Presbyterian Church and a road.  The settlers hurriedly put the stockade up with about 1200 logs.  They planted a double row of logs on end, three feet into the ground and ten feet protruding out, approximately 120 feet square.  Henderson Marsh Angier took charge of the crew that was putting up the timbers for the stockade.  He also went on many of the expeditions looking for the missing settlers and burying the dead.  That night, just after midnight, the Sioux snuck up on the Forest City Stockade corral to take the horses so that the settlers would be trapped inside the fort.  They had no problem accomplishing their task except for Peter Lund\u2019s Indian pony, which shied away from the Indians and started making noise.  (Months before, the Indians had abused the horse and finally sold it to Lund.) The pony bolted out of the corral and headed for the gate of the stockade where an aroused sentry let the horse inside.  Thus, Lund\u2019s pony was the only horse the settlers had during the attack until help arrived later.\n\nAbout 200 to 250 Indians attacked at around three in the morning on September 4, 1862, and they were driven back in a couple of hours.  While attacking, they resorted to burning and random shooting.  Ten to twelve Indians were reportedly killed (one source says 3), and one soldier was injured.  Henderson Marsh Angier was with a group outside of the stockade fighting the Indians and he was standing next to Alsog Olson when Olson was wounded.   He helped assist Olson, and William Branham, who was also wounded, back inside the stockade. A state of siege existed at the Forest City Stockade for ten days following the Indians\u2019 initial attack.  No one could come or go and the provisions inside were meek.  A young man risked his life running through the Indian camp under cover of darkness to return to his home for a sack of flour.  Surprisingly, he made it back to the stockade.\n\nFinally, on September 15, 1862, Capt. George F. Pettit's Company B, 8th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers Regiment, hastily organized in Faribault as the \u201cGuerrilla Guards\u201d, arrived as the first military organization to help in Meeker County and the Indians scattered. The Sioux left in three groups by the Manannah Road, the Greenleaf Road, and the Rice City (Darwin) Road.  As they left, they stole livestock and burned one barn and six houses belonging to William Richardson, Milton Gorton, James P. Howlett, Dudley Taylor, A. B. Hoyt, William Richards, and A. C Smith.  Over time, the stockade disappeared from a combination of the elements and the desire to use it for building logs or firewood for surrounding settlers.  On September 12, 1976, a restored Forest City stockade was dedicated in a grand ceremony and it is now open to the public.  The replica stockade is located 6 miles northeast of Litchfield and approximately \u00bd mile south of Forest City on Highway 24.\n\nThe first homesteader recorded in Forest City was Michael Flynn (Lot 2, Sec. 34. D.E.) on January 1, 1863.  Recorded means he was the first man to go to St. Cloud and register his claim.  The first Masonic Lodge in Meeker County started up in Forest City on May 18, 1867.  The original Meeker County News was Meeker County\u2019s first newspaper.  Frank Belfoy started it in Forest City in the spring of 1868 with Minnesota\u2019s first printing press.  The paper was moved to Litchfield, where it merged with the Litchfield Ledger in April 1882, becoming the News-Ledger.  Frank Daggett and Wellington D. Joubert had established the News Ledger newspaper in April 1872 in Forest City. That paper was also moved to Litchfield where it was joined with the Meeker County News.\n\nThe Church of St. Gertrude was built in 1867. John Dougherty and others hauled the lumber from St. Cloud to build it. It was located north of the stockade and was moved in 1897 to its present location. It has been remodeled and enlarged.  The cemetery, which is a part of the church grounds, is one of the oldest in the county and contains the marked graves of many of the earliest pioneers. Among the graves in this cemetery is the one of John Dougherty, who helped build the church and assisted in the internment of the victims of the Acton Massacre in the cemetery at Ness Church by Litchfield.  Anna Crusoe (Mrs. Joseph Crusoe, 1859-1943) came with her parents from Sherburne County in 1869.  Also in 1869, a house was moved to 114 Marshall Avenue North in Litchfield from Forest City.  Adam Klass had owned the house in Forest City.  It was twenty-five by thirty-six feet and two-stories high.  It had been Klaas\u2019 saloon in Forest City and it became the same in Litchfield, plus a boarding house.  It eventually served as a unit of the Exchange Hotel, which was next door to the north.  The original house is still at that address in Litchfield today.  Otis C. McGray moved his dry goods cash store to Forest City from Litchfield in February 1873.  The Baptists built a church in Forest City in 1879.\n\nThere\u2019s a phenomenon that occurs on a hill not far from the Forest City Stockade.  It\u2019s just north of the town of Forest City.  The hill has acquired the name of \u201cIndian Ghost Hill\u201d.  The phenomenon defies gravity, or it appears to. Some people suggest there is a gravity anomaly or a magnetic vortex there.  When you drive to the site and reach the top of the hill,  turn your car around so that you\u2019re facing north and observe that it\u2019s downhill in front of you and behind you towards the curve in the road.  Then drive back down the hill.  Put your car in neutral, turn your engine off (or not) and release your brake.  As crazy as it sounds, your car will be \u201cpulled\u201d backward, back up the hill.  The folklore that is told is that ghosts of the Indian children killed there push your car back up the hill as a warning to not think about building a home on that land, which was thought to be sacred by the Indians.  Here are instructions on how to get there, if you\u2019d like to try it:  Take County Road 2 north out of Forest City, going over a bridge.  Go 1.5 miles from bridge to 330th Street, turn right and go .5 mile to 660th Street, turn right again and drive up the small hill.   The hill is just before the curve to the left.  Turn around to face north and observe that it\u2019s downhill behind you and in front of you.  Drive about halfway down the hill and stop.  Put your car in neutral and take your foot off the brake.  The farther you go down the hill the faster you will be pulled back up the hill.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Terry Tales]] by Terry R.

The community is located along Meeker County Road 2 near its junction with State Highway 24 ([[Minnesota State Highway 24|MN 24]]).  The North Fork of the [[Crow River (Minnesota)|Crow River]] flows nearby.\n\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 181\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |author=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\nIn the late spring or early summer of 1855, John W. Huy, Benjamin Brown, and someone named Mackenzie, all employed by a St. Paul lumber company, paddled a canoe up the Crow River to the Minnesota Territory\u2019s west-central area, the Big Woods, in search of pine timber.  Not satisfied with their findings, they returned to St. Paul, but Huy organized another exploring party, consisting of a young lawyer named D. M. Hanson (called the first Swede to visit the area), Dr. Thomas H. Skinner, and Rudolph Schultz (1825-1910).  Late that summer, the explorers took off for the same area and in the fall they stopped in what is now Harvey Township.  There they planned to start a new town and call it Kar-i-shon, [[Sioux]] for \u201ccrow\u201d, which is what the Indians called the area.  But, for some reason, they moved on to the present day Forest City area where they met Dr. [[Frederick Noah Ripley]].  They preferred this area, so Schultz and Huy made a dugout house on the banks of the Crow River where it made a junction with a creek, (section 13 of Harvey Township), and Huy stayed in it through the following winter to make a claim on the land.  He thus became the first permanent white resident of the county.  The others, except for Dr. Ripley, returned to St. Paul where Hanson went before the legislature and urged them to create a new county, which would include the area he had just visited.\n\nThe legislature complied and established Meeker County on February 23, 1856.  The county was named in honor of Bradley B. Meeker (1813 -1873) of Minneapolis, who had been an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1849 to 1853.  Early in 1856, the settlers in Forest City were Milton C. Moore and Elijah Bemis (b.1812).  Moore became Meeker County\u2019s first Register of Deeds and Bemis became the county\u2019s first sheriff.  James Benjamin Atkinson, Sr. (b.1822) opened the first store in Forest City on March 1, 1857.  It was also the first in the county.  In 1862, Atkinson took on a partner, Mark W. Piper, who ran the store starting in October 1863 while Atkinson enlisted to serve in the Union Army.  In 1866, after Capt. Atkinson returned, Piper sold his half back to him and Atkinson ran it until 1879.\n\nD. M. Hanson and John W. Huy, who were appointed county commissioners, met in the newly started Forest City on May 6, 1856, and organized the county on paper.  Ripley, another appointed commissioner, was to have joined them, but he had frozen to death on March 3, 1856, by the lake in Litchfield that hence bore his name.  William S. Chapman found Ripley\u2019s body later in that spring.  With the nearby Crow River for transportation, more and more people gravitated to Forest City.  It was named the county seat because it had a river for shipping goods.  The addition of the railroad through Litchfield changed the population makeup of the county.   A referendum was held and, with the difference of only eighty-nine votes, they changed the county seat to Litchfield.  So, Litchfield had the courthouse that was in Forest City.  The old Forest City Courthouse was moved to 15 East Fifth Street in Litchfield in 1870.  Litchfield Village Council President Jesse Vawter Branham, Jr. owned the building and he leased it out residential because the city decided it was too small for a courthouse.   After all, it was only a small wooden house painted white.   Many of the buildings in Forest City became buildings in Litchfield.  One of those was F. G. Alvord\u2019s blacksmith shop.\n\nOther new settlers to Forest City in 1856 were Walter C. Bacon, James Bramhall, Henry Clinton, Charles E. Cutts, Wait H. Dart, Isaac C. Delamater, Edward Fitzgerald, John Flynn, John W. Griswold, Loring Huy, Thomas Carlos Jewett (came on June 20 and was the postmaster in 1863), John W. Johnson, John Kimball, Charles McAron, David Mitchell, John Patterson, John A. Quick, Rev. John Robson, Wyman Ryan, Charles N. Shed, Mathew Miles Standish, Judson A. Stanton, Samuel and Dudley Taylor, George O. Thomas, Ogden T. Tuttle, William H. Van Ness, Leander L. Wakefield, Jacob Weymer, Joseph Weymer, Sr., John Whalen, and John Wigis.  The first 4 July celebration took place in Forest City in 1856.  On June 22, Rudolph Schultz, Charles Johnson, and James W. Quick brought a large tree pole out of the woods and raised it in Forest City.  A small tin pan was washed and nailed on the top of the pole and the flag was raised up to it.  The U. S. flag was made from a white cotton shirt furnished by Thomas Carlos Jewett (1827-1900), some red flannel underwear given by Sgt. Matthew Miles Standish (1833-1864), and a blue denim overall offered by John W. Huy. What took place at the actual 4 July celebration was never recorded.\n\nSarah Jane Dougherty, daughter of Thomas Dougherty, was born in a covered wagon in Forest City on July 15, 1856, and she has been called the first white child born in Meeker County. She died in 1952.  The first post office in Meeker County was started in Forest City on October 4, 1856, with Walter C. Bacon as the postmaster.  He was succeeded by James B. Atkinson, Sr.  The post office remained in operation until 1907.  The first death reported was Frank Parsons on November 12, 1856.  The first religious service was by a Methodist minister, Rev. John Robson, Jr., in November 1856.  Rev. Thomas Hardwood was the first permanent pastor.\n\nNew settlers in 1857 were Henderson Marsh Angier, James B. Atkinson, H. N. Baker, Jacob Ball, Gilbert M. Blandin, Benjamin F. Butler, W. S Chapman, David Poster Delamater (1828-1907), Milton Gorton, Thomas Grayson, N. O. Griffin, L. F. Haines, A. F. Heath, John Heath, Azro B. Hoyt, Jacob Knapp, Michael Lenhart, John and Michael Murray, Isaac Perrine, William Richards, Hamlet Stevens, John Sullivan, Allen Teachout, H. S. Walker, Charles and William Willis, James Willis, and W. W. Woodman.  Forest City was platted in 1857 and was named for its location near the Big Woods. The first Catholic mass in Meeker County was in the plain cabin home of John Flynn and it was officiated by Rev. Father Alexius in 1857.  Two years later, Father Benedict administered the last rites of the church to one of Forest City\u2019s first settlers.  Father Benedict has been memorialized by one of the windows in the Church of St. Gertrude. Dudley Taylor and his wife operated the first hotel.  It was a large log building. The first schoolhouse (District 2) was built in 1857.  W. W. Woodman was employed to build it at a cost of $250.  The first teacher was Thomas Carlos Jewett.  A creek in Litchfield was named after Jewett, who came to Meeker County on June 20, 1856.  At different times, Jewett was the Meeker County Sheriff, the registrar of deeds, a Justice of the Peace, and a United States Commissioner to Alaska, appointed by Grover Cleveland.\n\nThere were another 20 settlers who came in 1858 when Minnesota had just become a state. In 1858, John Robson built the first steam-powered sawmill near the village.  Fitch and Stanton opened a store than he ran from 1858 to 1862.  J. A. Baird had a brickyard (the first in the county) briefly in 1858.  Thomas H. Skinner started a store in 1862. When the Sioux attacked in August 1862, Jesse, V. Branham, Sr., at the age of fifty-nine, was the only person, of the six hundred assembled in Forest City, to volunteer to ride his horse to St. Paul to get help.  That\u2019s about a hundred miles or more on horseback.  His son, Jesse V. Branham, Jr., was a scout with Capt. Richard Strout and it was Jr.\u2019s idea to build the stockade at Forest City.  While his father rode to St. Paul, Jesse, Jr. rode around the county, like Paul Revere, alerting settlers that the Indians were attacking.\n\nOn August 17th, on Branham\u2019s ride, during the skirmish with the Indians, Jesse, Jr. had stopped to reload his rifle and he was shot in the chest.  The bullet passed through his lungs and came out his back.  He never fell and he was able to walk instead to his team of horses and go for help.  He rode without medical attention for eight hours until he reached Hutchinson.  Jesse collapsed at a farmhouse. The wound was cleaned by running a silk handkerchief entirely through Jesse\u2019s body before the doctor, who was summoned, came. \u201cI can do nothing for this man,\u201d the doctor said, after taking one look at Jesse.  \u201cMake him as comfortable as you can.  He\u2019ll be dead in three hours.\u201d  Obviously, he was wrong.  Branham survived and became Litchfield\u2019s first Village Council President.\n\nThe stockade had been begun before the uprising, but it wasn\u2019t quite finished when the Indians had begun attacking the settlers.  Luckily, the majority of the stockade went up in one day, on September 3.  There were logs close by that were going to be used to build the Forest City Presbyterian Church and a road.  The settlers hurriedly put the stockade up with about 1200 logs.  They planted a double row of logs on end, three feet into the ground and ten feet protruding out, approximately 120 feet square.  Henderson Marsh Angier took charge of the crew that was putting up the timbers for the stockade.  He also went on many of the expeditions looking for the missing settlers and burying the dead.  That night, just after midnight, the Sioux snuck up on the Forest City Stockade corral to take the horses so that the settlers would be trapped inside the fort.  They had no problem accomplishing their task except for Peter Lund\u2019s Indian pony, which shied away from the Indians and started making noise.  (Months before, the Indians had abused the horse and finally sold it to Lund.) The pony bolted out of the corral and headed for the gate of the stockade where an aroused sentry let the horse inside.  Thus, Lund\u2019s pony was the only horse the settlers had during the attack until help arrived later.\n\nAbout 200 to 250 Indians attacked at around three in the morning on September 4, 1862, and they were driven back in a couple of hours.  While attacking, they resorted to burning and random shooting.  Ten to twelve Indians were reportedly killed (one source says 3), and one soldier was injured.  Henderson Marsh Angier was with a group outside of the stockade fighting the Indians and he was standing next to Alsog Olson when Olson was wounded.   He helped assist Olson, and William Branham, who was also wounded, back inside the stockade. A state of siege existed at the Forest City Stockade for ten days following the Indians\u2019 initial attack.  No one could come or go and the provisions inside were meek.  A young man risked his life running through the Indian camp under cover of darkness to return to his home for a sack of flour.  Surprisingly, he made it back to the stockade.\n\nFinally, on September 15, 1862, Capt. George F. Pettit's Company B, 8th Minnesota Infantry Volunteers Regiment, hastily organized in Faribault as the \u201cGuerrilla Guards\u201d, arrived as the first military organization to help in Meeker County and the Indians scattered. The Sioux left in three groups by the Manannah Road, the Greenleaf Road, and the Rice City (Darwin) Road.  As they left, they stole livestock and burned one barn and six houses belonging to William Richardson, Milton Gorton, James P. Howlett, Dudley Taylor, A. B. Hoyt, William Richards, and A. C Smith.  Over time, the stockade disappeared from a combination of the elements and the desire to use it for building logs or firewood for surrounding settlers.  On September 12, 1976, a restored Forest City stockade was dedicated in a grand ceremony and it is now open to the public.  The replica stockade is located 6 miles northeast of Litchfield and approximately \u00bd mile south of Forest City on Highway 24.\n\nThe first homesteader recorded in Forest City was Michael Flynn (Lot 2, Sec. 34. D.E.) on January 1, 1863.  Recorded means he was the first man to go to St. Cloud and register his claim.  The first Masonic Lodge in Meeker County started up in Forest City on May 18, 1867.  The original Meeker County News was Meeker County\u2019s first newspaper.  Frank Belfoy started it in Forest City in the spring of 1868 with Minnesota\u2019s first printing press.  The paper was moved to Litchfield, where it merged with the Litchfield Ledger in April 1882, becoming the News-Ledger.  Frank Daggett and Wellington D. Joubert had established the News Ledger newspaper in April 1872 in Forest City. That paper was also moved to Litchfield where it was joined with the Meeker County News.\n\nThe Church of St. Gertrude was built in 1867. John Dougherty and others hauled the lumber from St. Cloud to build it. It was located north of the stockade and was moved in 1897 to its present location. It has been remodeled and enlarged.  The cemetery, which is a part of the church grounds, is one of the oldest in the county and contains the marked graves of many of the earliest pioneers. Among the graves in this cemetery is the one of John Dougherty, who helped build the church and assisted in the internment of the victims of the Acton Massacre in the cemetery at Ness Church by Litchfield.  Anna Crusoe (Mrs. Joseph Crusoe, 1859-1943) came with her parents from Sherburne County in 1869.  Also in 1869, a house was moved to 114 Marshall Avenue North in Litchfield from Forest City.  Adam Klass had owned the house in Forest City.  It was twenty-five by thirty-six feet and two-stories high.  It had been Klaas\u2019 saloon in Forest City and it became the same in Litchfield, plus a boarding house.  It eventually served as a unit of the Exchange Hotel, which was next door to the north.  The original house is still at that address in Litchfield today.  Otis C. McGray moved his dry goods cash store to Forest City from Litchfield in February 1873.  The Baptists built a church in Forest City in 1879.\n\nThere\u2019s a phenomenon that occurs on a hill not far from the Forest City Stockade.  It\u2019s just north of the town of Forest City.  The hill has acquired the name of \u201cIndian Ghost Hill\u201d.  The phenomenon defies gravity, or it appears to. Some people suggest there is a gravity anomaly or a magnetic vortex there.  When you drive to the site and reach the top of the hill,  turn your car around so that you\u2019re facing north and observe that it\u2019s downhill in front of you and behind you towards the curve in the road.  Then drive back down the hill.  Put your car in neutral, turn your engine off (or not) and release your brake.  As crazy as it sounds, your car will be \u201cpulled\u201d backward, back up the hill.  The folklore that is told is that ghosts of the Indian children killed there push your car back up the hill as a warning to not think about building a home on that land, which was thought to be sacred by the Indians.
