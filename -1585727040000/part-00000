At 19 he won the [[World Junior Chess Championship]].

It called for one match between Ponomariov and Kasparov (the world number one), and another between Kramnik and the winner of the 2002 Einstein tournament in [[Dortmund]] (who turned out to be [[P\u00e9ter L\u00e9k\u00f3]]).<ref>{{cite web |first=Yasser |last=Seirawan |title=A Fresh Start for chess |url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/yaer-seirawan-proposes-i-a-fresh-start-i-for-che |website=ChessBase |date=March 2, 2002 |accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref> The winners of these matches would then play each other to become undisputed World Champion. This plan was signed by all parties on May 6, 2002, in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\". The Kramnik-Leko match took place (the match was drawn, with Kramnik retaining his title); the Kasparov-Ponomariov match was canceled in 2003, and this particular plan became moot when Kasparov retired in 2005. In the end the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006]] between Kramnik and [[Veselin Topalov]] reunited the world championship title.\n\nFollowing a series of events Seirawan participated in China during September 2003, there were reports that he would be retiring as a professional player. In the July 2007 [[FIDE]] list, Seirawan had an [[Elo rating]] of 2634, placing him in the top 100 chess players in the world, and America's number four (behind [[Hikaru Nakamura]], [[Gata Kamsky]] and [[Alexander Onischuk]]). He played six games in the July 2007 FIDE update.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2007, Seirawan unveiled his [[chess variant|enhanced chess game]] called [[Seirawan chess]].

At 19 he won the [[World Junior Chess Championship]]. He also won a game against [[Viktor Korchnoi]], who then invited Seirawan to Switzerland, where Korchnoi was training for his [[World Chess Championship 1981|1981 world title match]] against [[Anatoly Karpov]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=William |last=Tracy |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199002/the.right.moves.htm |work=Saudi Aramco World |volume=41 |number=2 |date=March\u2013April 1990 |title=The Right Moves}}</ref>\n\nSeirawan qualified for the 1985 and 1988-1990 [[Candidates Tournament]]s.

It called for one match between Ponomariov and Kasparov (the world number one), and another between Kramnik and the winner of the 2002 Einstein tournament in [[Dortmund]] (who turned out to be [[P\u00e9ter L\u00e9k\u00f3]]).<ref>{{cite web |first=Yasser |last=Seirawan |title=A Fresh Start for chess |url=http://en.chessbase.com/post/yaer-seirawan-proposes-i-a-fresh-start-i-for-che |website=ChessBase |date=March 2, 2002 |accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref> The winners of these matches would then play each other to become undisputed World Champion. This plan was signed by all parties on May 6, 2002, in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\". The Kramnik-Leko match took place (the match was drawn, with Kramnik retaining his title); the Kasparov-Ponomariov match was canceled in 2003, and this particular plan became moot when Kasparov retired in 2005. In the end the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2006]] between Kramnik and [[Veselin Topalov]] reunited the world championship title.\n\nFollowing a series of events Seirawan participated in China during September 2003, there were reports that he would be retiring as a professional player. In the July 2007 [[FIDE]] list, Seirawan had an [[Elo rating]] of 2634, placing him in the top 100 chess players in the world, and America's number four (behind [[Hikaru Nakamura]], [[Gata Kamsky]] and [[Alexander Onischuk]]). He played six games in the July 2007 FIDE update.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2007, Seirawan unveiled his [[chess variant|enhanced chess game]] called [[Seirawan chess]].
