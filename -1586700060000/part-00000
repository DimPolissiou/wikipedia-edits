In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner [[Justin Rose]].

Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the [[2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational|WGC-Bridgestone Invitational]], recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven-stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.\n\nAfter a slow start to 2014, Woods sustained an injury during the final round of the [[Honda Classic]] and was unable to finish the tournament.

Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and would eventually finish 69th.

The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke better when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003\u201304. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \"superstar\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.<ref>Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030936/http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf |date=April 17, 2012 }}, Job Market Paper, November 2007</ref>\n\nMany courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, in a strategy that became known as \"Tiger-proofing\".

By the end of April 1997, he had won three [[PGA Tour]] events in addition to his first major, the [[1997 Masters Tournament|1997 Masters]], which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance. He reached [[List of World Number One male golfers|number one]] in the [[Official World Golf Ranking|world rankings]] for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 weeks). During this time, he won 13 of golf's major championships.\n\nThe next decade of Woods' career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries. He took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 in an attempt to resolve marital issues with his then-wife, [[Elin Nordegren|Elin]].

Sportswriter Bill Lyon of [[Knight Ridder]] asked in a column, \"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).<ref name=\"Bad\">{{cite news |title=Woods bad for golf? There's an unplayable lie |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |last=Lyon |first=Bill |date=August 16, 2000 }}</ref> At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\n\nA related effect was measured by [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke better when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003\u201304. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \"superstar\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.<ref>Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030936/http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf |date=April 17, 2012 }}, Job Market Paper, November 2007</ref>\n\nMany courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods; this is a strategy that became known as \"Tiger-Proofing\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.<ref name=\"Open2005\">{{cite news|title=Tiger Woods Press Conference:The Open Championship |publisher=TigerWoods.com |agency=ASAP Sports |date=July 12, 2005 |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&iNewsID=199184&categoryID=&pagenumber=1&cat=0 |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316104728/http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&iNewsID=199184&categoryID=&pagenumber=1&cat=0 |archivedate=March 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Career achievements==\n{{Main|List of career achievements by Tiger Woods}}\n\nWoods has won 82 official [[PGA Tour]] events, including 15 [[Men's major golf championships|majors]].

His career officially took off in 1985, when he opened his club, House Caf\u00e9, in the city of Basel. This club was a benchmark for the progress of the musical scene in Basel and its cult-parties are still in fond memories. After a short trip into the Swiss hip hop scene, DJ Antoine quickly switched genre. In 1998, he released his first album \"DJ Antoine \u2013 The Pumpin' House Mix\". In 1991, his album \"Houseworks 1\" won him his first gold award. After that, things started to move very fast. To this day, DJ Antoine has published just over 50 albums, strongly establishing himself in the music and clubbing scene. Since 2003 he has been hosting his own weekly radio show, which is broadcast by radio stations all over the world.<ref name=universal>{{cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.fr/artiste/4397-dj-antoine/bio |title=DJ Antoine |publisher=Universal Music France |language=french |access-date=23 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===International breakthrough===\nIn 2006, DJ Antoine gained international popularity with his live album ''DJ Antoine \u2013 Live in Moscow'' and the 2007 released single ''This Time''. Ever since, he has been a highly demanded act in popular and trendy clubs all over the world. Gigs in New York, Chicago, Miami, Montreal, Moscow, Dubai, Bangkok, Oslo, Vienna and Cairo have turned into a regular but exciting part of his everyday life. Acknowledging his international success, All Around The World Records, the electronic music label owned by Universal Music UK, [[Blanco y Negro Music|Blanco y Negro Spain]], Happy Music France, EMI Music South Africa, [[Ultra Records|Ultra Records USA]] and [[Kontor Records|Kontor Records Germany]] signed the single ''This Time'' in 2009.\n \nDJ Antoine achieved many awards in 21st century's first decade. In 2001, he achieved an Ericsson Dance Music Award for ''Most Successful Artist Of The Year 2000'' in the category ''House / UK Garage / Progressive House''. In 2008, DJ Antoine created a stir with his sociocritical album ''DJ Antoine \u2013Stop!'', on which he openly spoke out against juvenile violence, calling for more civil courage. In spring 2009, the record was priced with a Swiss Music Award for ''Best National Dance Album''. The following year, he defended that title with his album ''DJ Antoine \u2013 2009'', receiving the Swiss [[Prix Walo]] for his work. In 2010, he reached another level of success in Switzerland: His album ''DJ Antoine \u2013 2010'' was certified with a platinum record. It again was nominated for a Swiss Music Award in the category ''Best National Dance Album''.\n \nIn the studio DJ Antoine works with his long-time business partner Fabio Antoniali also known as Mad Mark. Well-known musicians such as [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Afrojack]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Robin S.]], [[Roberto Blanco]] and [[Ivana Trump]] have had their tracks exclusively remixed by the two artists. In 2010, DJ Antoine produced songs for Timati, [[Snoop Dogg]], [[DJ Smash (Russian musician)|DJ Smash]] and [[Bob Sinclar]]. That same year, house legend Mr. Mike joined the team as a vocalist, also accompanying the DJ to selected performances.\n \nAnother highlight of his career marks a collaboration with Russian rapper [[Timati]] and American singer [[Kalenna Harper|Kalenna]] for the hit single ''[[Welcome to St. Tropez]]'', which was released in Germany and Austria by the successful German dance label [[Kontor Records]]. It became a Top-5-hit in the entire German-speaking room and grew DJ Antoine's popularity in many European countries. His 2012 released single ''[[Ma Ch\u00e9rie]]'' became the most successful production in his career with more than 1 million units sold, several [[Music recording certification|gold and platinum awards]] and an [[MTV Europe Music Award|MTV European Music Award]] for Best Swiss Act in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/charts/best/singles|title=Ewige Bestenliste - Singles|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djantoine.com/about/|title=About DJ Antoine|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> Both singles and another collaboration with [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Timati]] and [[Dirty Money (duo)|Dirty Money]] called ''I'm On You'' were a part of his 2011 released and gold-certified album ''Welcome To DJ Antoine''.\n \nFrom this time forward, DJ Antoine and his studio partner Mad Mark produced four more albums which charted regularly in Switzerland and partly in other European countries. Especially his 2013 released album ''[[Sky Is the Limit|Sky Is The Limit]]'' became a huge commercial success reaching the top of Switzerland's album charts and the Top-10 in Germany. It was certified with a platinum award in Switzerland and a gold award in Germany. ''Holiday'', a collaboration with American singer [[Akon]] in 2015, marked the highlight of his 2016 released album ''Provocateur'' with chart presence in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/DJ-Antoine-feat.-Akon/Holiday-1442341|title=DJ Antoine feat. Akon - Holiday|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>\n \nLabels like [[Maurice Lacroix]], [[Perrier-Jou\u00ebt]] \"Belle Epoque\" champagne and the Swiss custom tailor SuitArt have all worked with him.

Lindeberg, [[Paco Rabanne]] and the German TV station [[ProSieben|Pro7]].

His career officially took off in 1995, when he opened his club, House Caf\u00e9, in the city of Basel. This club was a benchmark for the progress of the musical scene in Basel and its cult-parties are still in fond memories. After a short trip into the Swiss hip hop scene, DJ Antoine quickly switched genre. In 1998, he released his first album \"DJ Antoine \u2013 The Pumpin' House Mix\". In 2001, his album \"Houseworks 1\" won him his first gold award. After that, things started to move very fast. To this day, DJ Antoine has published just over 50 albums, strongly establishing himself in the music and clubbing scene. Since 2003 he has been hosting his own weekly radio show, which is broadcast by radio stations all over the world.<ref name=universal>{{cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.fr/artiste/4397-dj-antoine/bio |title=DJ Antoine |publisher=Universal Music France |language=french |access-date=23 September 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===International breakthrough===\nIn 2006, DJ Antoine gained international popularity with his live album ''DJ Antoine \u2013 Live in Moscow'' and the 2007 released single ''This Time''. Ever since, he has been a highly demanded act in popular and trendy clubs all over the world. Gigs in New York, Chicago, Miami, Montreal, Moscow, Dubai, Bangkok, Oslo, Vienna and Cairo have turned into a regular but exciting part of his everyday life. Acknowledging his international success, All Around The World Records, the electronic music label owned by Universal Music UK, [[Blanco y Negro Music|Blanco y Negro Spain]], Happy Music France, EMI Music South Africa, [[Ultra Records|Ultra Records USA]] and [[Kontor Records|Kontor Records Germany]] signed the single ''This Time'' in 2009.\n \nDJ Antoine achieved many awards in 21st century's first decade. In 2001, he achieved an Ericsson Dance Music Award for ''Most Successful Artist Of The Year 2000'' in the category ''House / UK Garage / Progressive House''. In 2008, DJ Antoine created a stir with his sociocritical album ''DJ Antoine \u2013Stop!'', on which he openly spoke out against juvenile violence, calling for more civil courage. In spring 2009, the record was priced with a Swiss Music Award for ''Best National Dance Album''. The following year, he defended that title with his album ''DJ Antoine \u2013 2009'', receiving the Swiss [[Prix Walo]] for his work. In 2010, he reached another level of success in Switzerland: His album ''DJ Antoine \u2013 2010'' was certified with a platinum record. It again was nominated for a Swiss Music Award in the category ''Best National Dance Album''.\n \nIn the studio DJ Antoine works with his long-time business partner Fabio Antoniali also known as Mad Mark. Well-known musicians such as [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Afrojack]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Robin S.]], [[Roberto Blanco]] and [[Ivana Trump]] have had their tracks exclusively remixed by the two artists. In 2010, DJ Antoine produced songs for Timati, [[Snoop Dogg]], [[DJ Smash (Russian musician)|DJ Smash]] and [[Bob Sinclar]]. That same year, house legend Mr. Mike joined the team as a vocalist, also accompanying the DJ to selected performances.\n \nAnother highlight of his career marks a collaboration with Russian rapper [[Timati]] and American singer [[Kalenna Harper|Kalenna]] for the hit single ''[[Welcome to St. Tropez]]'', which was released in Germany and Austria by the successful German dance label [[Kontor Records]]. It became a Top-5-hit in the entire German-speaking room and grew DJ Antoine's popularity in many European countries. His 2012 released single ''[[Ma Ch\u00e9rie]]'' became the most successful production in his career with more than 1 million units sold, several [[Music recording certification|gold and platinum awards]] and an [[MTV Europe Music Award|MTV European Music Award]] for Best Swiss Act in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/charts/best/singles|title=Ewige Bestenliste - Singles|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djantoine.com/about/|title=About DJ Antoine|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> Both singles and another collaboration with [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Timati]] and [[Dirty Money (duo)|Dirty Money]] called ''I'm On You'' were a part of his 2011 released and gold-certified album ''Welcome To DJ Antoine''.\n \nFrom this time forward, DJ Antoine and his studio partner Mad Mark produced four more albums which charted regularly in Switzerland and partly in other European countries. Especially his 2013 released album ''[[Sky Is the Limit|Sky Is The Limit]]'' became a huge commercial success reaching the top of Switzerland's album charts and the Top-10 in Germany. It was certified with a platinum award in Switzerland and a gold award in Germany. ''Holiday'', a collaboration with American singer [[Akon]] in 2015, marked the highlight of his 2016 released album ''Provocateur'' with chart presence in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/song/DJ-Antoine-feat.-Akon/Holiday-1442341|title=DJ Antoine feat.

She was featured on [[Rasheeda]]'s ''[[GA Peach]]'' on the track \"Pack Ya Bags\" and [[Timati]]'s ''[[The Boss (Timati album)|The Boss]]'' on the track \"Sexy Bitch\". A track leaked in 2008 titled \"Kaboom\" is a duet between Harper and [[Lady Gaga]] recorded during their sessions with [[Jim Jonsin]], before either singer was famous.\n\nAdditional credits include, [[Maino]] ([[Don't Say Nothing]]), [[Three 6 Mafia]] ([[Shake My]]), [[Ciara]] (Kiss My Swag), Trina (Let them Hoes Fight) and Dirty Money (Love Come Down). She's also been featured on the movie soundtracks to \"Phat Girls\" (Stronger) and \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" (Big Spender). \"Let Them Hoes Fight\" was originally slated to feature Gaga, but solely Harper's vocals ultimately made the record.\n\n===2009&ndash;12: Diddy-Dirty Money===\nHarper became a member of a group called [[Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money]], which included Harper and former [[Danity Kane]] member [[Dawn Richard (singer)|Dawn Richard]]. The band worked heavily on [[Sean Combs|Diddy]]'s new album ''[[Last Train to Paris]]''. They released three singles in total. \"[[Angels (Diddy-Dirty Money song)|Angels]]\" was the band's debut single and featured [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], and was officially released on November 3 (but the song had leaked to the internet in early June). The video was directed by [[Hype Williams]]. The band's second single \"[[Love Come Down (Diddy-Dirty Money song)|Love Come Down]]\" was released later that day (November 3). Both singles appeared on Diddy's album ''Last Train To Paris''.\n\nOn November 13, a new Diddy-Dirty Money song leaked onto the internet. The song \"Hurt\" was a demo but officially became known as \"Loving You No More,\" and features [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]. The song is likely to be a track on ''Last Train To Paris''. The band's third single \"[[Hello Good Morning]]\"  featured rapper [[T.I.]] and was released on March 30, 2010.\n\nThe group has performed on the 2010 BET Awards and nominated for the BET Best Group award. The album's fourth single \"[[Loving You No More]]\" featuring Drake was released on iTunes on September 21, 2010. She also co-wrote a song with [[Christina Aguilera]] on the Switch and John Hill production \"Bionic\" for Aguilera's 2010 fourth studio album, ''[[Bionic (Christina Aguilera album)|Bionic]]''.\n\nIn 2012, the group disbanded. From there, Kalenna returned to making music as a solo artist.\n\n===2012-15: ''Black Orchid, Love and Hiphop Atlanta''===\nKalenna released a mix-tape called ''Chamber of Diaries'' on February 13, 2012 free of charge, consisting of thirteen tracks.
