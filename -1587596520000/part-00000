she and her husband, [[Saint Joachim]], are infertile, but God hears their prayers for a child, and so Mary is conceived and born, and, like Samuel, is taken to spend her childhood in the temple.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} In the earliest texts, probably representing the original version, the conception occurs without [[sexual intercourse]] between Anne and Joachim, but the story does not advance the idea of an immaculate conception.{{sfn|Shoemaker|2016|p=unpaginated}} The Protevangelium does not advance the idea that Mary was conceived without [[original sin]].{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} \n\n===Original sin===\nOriginal sin was defined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD).{{sfn|Wiley|2002|p=37}} Engaged in a controversy with the monk [[Pelagius]] over the question of whether infants could sin (Pelagius said they could not and therefore would not go to hell if unbaptised), he inserted original sin and the fall from grace into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and Paul's [[Letter to the Romans]],{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} it is not part of the story of [[Adam and Eve]]{{sfn|Toews|2013|pp=88}} and the [[Apostle Paul]] regarded sin and death not as a punishment for Adam's sin but as the natural lot of mankind.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Augustine also identified male semen as the means by which original sin was made heritable, leaving only Jesus Christ, conceived without semen, free of the sin passed down from Adam through the sexual act,{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} a sentiment echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=43}}\n\n===Medieval formulation===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876. Saint Antony's Church, [[Urtij\u00ebi]], Italy.]]\nMary's [[sinlessness of Mary|freedom from personal sin]] was affirmed in the 4th century, but Augustine's argument that original sin was transmitted through sex raised the question of whether she could also be free of the sin of Adam.{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}} The English ecclesiastic and scholar [[Eadmer]] (c.1060-c.1126) reasoned that it was possible in view of God's omnipotence and appropriate in view of Mary's role as [[Mother of God]]: ''Potuit, decuit, fecit'', \"it was possible, it was fitting, therefore it was done;\"{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36-37}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274), among others, objected that if Mary were free of original sin at her conception then she would have no need of redemption, making Christ superfluous; they were answered answered by [[Duns Scotus]] (1264-1308), who reasoned that her preservation from original sin was a redemption more perfect than that granted through Christ.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=37-38}} \n\nNevertheless, it was not theological theory that initiated discussion of Mary's freedom from mankind's curse, but the celebration of her [[liturgy]], for the popular feast of her conception brought forth the objection that as normal human conception is sinful, to celebrate Mary's conception was to celebrate a sinful event.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} Some held that no sin had occurred, for Anne had conceived Mary not through sex but by kissing her husband Joachim, and that Anne's father and mother had likewise been conceived; but [[St Bridget of Sweden]] (c.1303-1373) told how Mary herself had revealed to her in a vision that although Anne and Joachim conceived their daughter through sexual union, the act was sinless because free of sexual desire.{{sfn|Solberg|2018|p=108-109}} \n\nIn 1431 the [[Council of Basel]] declared Mary's immaculate conception a \"pious opinion\" consistent with faith and Scripture; the [[Council of Trent]], held in several sessions in the early 1500s, made no explicit declaration on the subject but exempted her from the universality of original sin; and by 1571 the Pope's [[Breviary]] (prayerbook) set out an elaborate celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=4-5,117}}\n\n===''Ineffabilis Deus''===\nIt was popular support which led to the demand that the papacy elevate the doctrine to the status of dogma.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=6}} In 1830 [[Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (May 2, 1806-December 31, 1876) was granted a vision of Mary as the Immaculate Conception standing on a globe while a voice commanded Catherine to have a medal made in imitation of what she saw,{{sfn|Mack|2003}} and the apparition marked the beginning of a great 19th-century Marian revival.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=29}} At the time the church was engaged in a struggle against  modernity and the promotion of its authority,{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=249}} and in 1849 Pope [[Pius IX]] asked the bishops of the church for their views on whether the doctrine should be defined as dogma: ninety percent of those who responded were supportive, and in 1854 the papal bull ''Ineffabilis Deus'' was promulgated.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}} (A dogma is a divinely revealed truth proclaimed by the Church and binding on the faithful as necessary to salvation).{{sfn|O'Collins|1983|p=162}}\n\n''Ineffabilis Deus'' was one of the pivotal events of the papacy of Pius, pope from 16 June 1846 to his death on 7 February 1878.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} Up until this point it had been understood that dogma had to be based in Scripture and acepted by tradition,{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} but Mary's immaculate conception is not stated in the New Testament and cannot be deduced from it,{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} and it had caused a virtual civil war between [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s during the middle ages.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=335}} ''Ineffabilis Deus'' therefore was a novelty, being based instead on the declaration of a special commission to the effect that neither scripture nor tradition were necessary to define dogma, but only the authority of the church expressed in the Pope.{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} The Pope and his [[curia]] (the special body which forms the central government of the church) accordingly waived the absence of scriptural proof or a \"broad and ancient\" stream of tradition and promulgated Mary's immaculate conception solely on [[papal infallibility]],{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204-205}} itself promulgated as dogma in 1870.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}} (Some catholics unable to accept papal infallibility left the Roman Church and formed the [[Old Catholic Church]], which rejects also the Immaculate Conception).{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Smit|2019|p=14,53}} Four years later, Mary reputedly appeared to the young [[Bernadette Soubirous]] at [[Loudes]] in southern France, to announce that she was the Immaculate Conception.{{sfn|Hammond|2003|p=602}}\n\nThe Archbishop of Paris had warned Pius that the Immaculate Conception \"could be proved neither from the Scriptures nor from tradition,\"{{sfn|Schaff|1931|p=unpaginated}} but ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' found it in the Ark of Salvation ([[Noah's Ark]]), [[Jacob's Ladder]], the [[Burning Bush]] at Sinai, the Enclosed Garden from the [[Song of Songs]], and many more.{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=35}} From this wealth of support the pope's advisors singled out [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]] as the basis for the Immaculate Conception: \"The most glorious Virgin ... was foretold by God when he said to the serpent: 'I will put enmity between you and the woman,'\"{{sfn|Manelli|1994|p=6-7}} a prophecy which reached fulfillment in the figure of the Woman in the [[Revelation of John]], crowned with stars and trampling the Dragon underfoot.{{sfn|Twomey|2008|p=73-74}} Luke 1:28, and specifically the phrase \"full of grace\" by which [[Gabriel]] greeted Mary, was another reference to her immaculate conception: \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction.\"{{sfn|German|2001|p=596}}\n\n==Feast and patronages==\n[[File:Quadrittu (cropped).jpg|thumb|The procession of the ''Quadrittu'' of the Immaculate Conception taken on December 7 in [[Saponara]], [[Sicily]]]]\n{{Main|Patronages of the Immaculate Conception}}\n{{Main|Feast of the Immaculate Conception}}\nThe feast day of the Immaculate Conception is December 8.{{sfn|Barrely|2014|p=40}} Its celebration seems to have begun in the Eastern church in the 7th century and may have spread to Ireland by the 8th, although the earliest well-attested record in the Western church is from England early in the 11th.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It was suppressed there after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), and the first thorough exposition of the doctrine was a response to this suppression.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It continued to spread despite strong theological objections{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=128}} (in 1125 [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote to Lyons Cathedral to express his surprise and concern that it had recently begun to be observed there),{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} but in 1477 [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, placed it on the Roman calendar (i.e, list of Church festivals and observances).{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643}} [[Pius V]] suppressed it,{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=38}} but following the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' it was restored with the typically Franciscan phrase \"immaculate conception\" and given a formulary for the Mass, drawn largely from one composed for Sixtus IV, beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin...\". {{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643-644}}\n\nBy pontifical decree a number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception. These include [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea|Korea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]] (including the old kingdoms and the present state), the [[United States]] and [[Uruguay]]. By royal decree under the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], she is the principal Patroness of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Prayers and hymns==\nThe [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Rite]] [[Liturgy of the Hours]] naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \"[[Tota pulchra es|Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te]]\" (\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\" It continues: \"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun.

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the depiction of \"Our Lady\" seems to have been finally established by the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] in his  \"El arte de la pintura\" of 1649: a beautiful young girl of 12 or 13, wearing a white tunic and blue mantle, rays of light emanating from her head ringed by twelve stars and crowned by an imperial crown, the sun behind her and the moon beneath her feet.{{sfn|Moffitt|2001|p=676}} Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.{{sfn|Katz|Orsi|2001|p=98}} The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.{{sfn|Jenner|2009|p=3-9}}\n\n<br>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

the Prophet saying that Satan touches all the descendants of Adam \"except Mary and her child\"; medieval Christian monks later used this passage to claim that the Quran supported the Immaculate

from the moment of her [[Conception (biology)|conception]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=330}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Definition\">\"The Virgin Mary was preserved entirely free from original sin from the instant of her conception through a special prevenient grace, received in view of the merits of her Son in anticipation of the Redemption.\" See Reynolds (20102), p.330.</ref> It proved highly controversial in the Middle Ages, but revived in the 19th century and was adopted as church dogma when Pope [[Pius IX]] promulgated ''Ineffabilis Deus'' in 1854.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}}{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} The move had the overwhelming support of the church's hierarchy, although a few, including the Archbishop of Paris, warned that it is not stated in the New Testament and could not be deduced from it.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} Protestants overwhelmingly rejected ''Ineffabilis Deus'' as an exercise in papal power and the doctrine itself as without foundation in Scripture,{{sfn|Herringer|2019|p=507}} and [[Orthodox Christianity]], although it reveres Mary in its liturgy, called on the Roman church to return to the faith of the early centuries.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1981|p=90}} The iconography of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception shows her standing, with arms outspread or hands clasped in prayer, and her feast day is 8 December.{{sfn|Barrely|2014|p=40}}\n\nThe Immaculate Conception of Mary in the womb of her mother is not to be confused with her purity in the [[virgin birth of Jesus]].{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=272}}\n\n==Doctrine==\n\nThe Immaculate Conception of Mary is one of the four [[Mariology|Marian]] dogmas of the Catholic Church, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is [[heresy]].{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=133}} Defined by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, it states that Mary, through God's grace, was conceived free from the stain of [[original sin]] in view of her role as the [[Mother of God]]:{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}}\n\n<blockquote>\nWe declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.{{sfn|Sheed|1958|p=134-138}}\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile the doctrine asserts only Mary's freedom from original sin, the [[Council of Trent]], held between 1545 and 1563, affirmed in addition her freedom from personal sin.{{sfn|Fastiggi|2019|p=455}}\n\n==History==\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n===Anna, mother of Mary===\nThe mother of Mary is not a biblical character.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11}} She first appears in the late 2nd-century [[Protevangelium of James]], which names her [[Saint Anne|Anne]], probably from [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]], the mother of the prophet [[Samuel]]; she and her husband, [[Saint Joachim]], are infertile, but God hears their prayers for a child, and so Mary is conceived and born, and, like Samuel, is taken to spend her childhood in the temple.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} In the earliest texts, probably representing the original version, the conception occurs without [[sexual intercourse]] between Anne and Joachim, but the story does not advance the idea of an immaculate conception.{{sfn|Shoemaker|2016|p=unpaginated}} The Protevangelium does not advance the idea that Mary was conceived without [[original sin]].{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} \n\n===Original sin===\nOriginal sin was defined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD).{{sfn|Wiley|2002|p=37}} Engaged in a controversy with the monk [[Pelagius]] over the question of whether infants could sin (Pelagius said they could not and therefore would not go to hell if unbaptised), he inserted original sin and the fall from grace into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and Paul's [[Letter to the Romans]],{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} it is not part of the story of [[Adam and Eve]]{{sfn|Toews|2013|pp=88}} and the [[Apostle Paul]] regarded sin and death not as a punishment for Adam's sin but as the natural lot of mankind.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Augustine also identified male semen as the means by which original sin was made heritable, leaving only Jesus Christ, conceived without semen, free of the sin passed down from Adam through the sexual act,{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} a sentiment echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=43}}\n\n===Medieval formulation===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876. Saint Antony's Church, [[Urtij\u00ebi]], Italy.]]\nMary's [[sinlessness of Mary|freedom from personal sin]] was affirmed in the 4th century, but Augustine's argument that original sin was transmitted through sex raised the question of whether she could also be free of the sin of Adam.{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}} The English ecclesiastic and scholar [[Eadmer]] (c.1060-c.1126) reasoned that it was possible in view of God's omnipotence and appropriate in view of Mary's role as [[Mother of God]]: ''Potuit, decuit, fecit'', \"it was possible, it was fitting, therefore it was done;\"{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36-37}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274), among others, objected that if Mary were free of original sin at her conception then she would have no need of redemption, making Christ superfluous; they were answered answered by [[Duns Scotus]] (1264-1308), who reasoned that her preservation from original sin was a redemption more perfect than that granted through Christ.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=37-38}} \n\nNevertheless, it was not theological theory that initiated discussion of Mary's freedom from mankind's curse, but the celebration of her [[liturgy]], for the popular feast of her conception brought forth the objection that as normal human conception is sinful, to celebrate Mary's conception was to celebrate a sinful event.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} Some held that no sin had occurred, for Anne had conceived Mary not through sex but by kissing her husband Joachim, and that Anne's father and mother had likewise been conceived; but [[St Bridget of Sweden]] (c.1303-1373) told how Mary herself had revealed to her in a vision that although Anne and Joachim conceived their daughter through sexual union, the act was sinless because free of sexual desire.{{sfn|Solberg|2018|p=108-109}} \n\nIn 1431 the [[Council of Basel]] declared Mary's immaculate conception a \"pious opinion\" consistent with faith and Scripture; the [[Council of Trent]], held in several sessions in the early 1500s, made no explicit declaration on the subject but exempted her from the universality of original sin; and by 1571 the Pope's [[Breviary]] (prayerbook) set out an elaborate celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=4-5,117}}\n\n===''Ineffabilis Deus''===\nIt was popular support which led to the demand that the papacy elevate the doctrine to the status of dogma.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=6}} In 1830 [[Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (May 2, 1806-December 31, 1876) was granted a vision of Mary as the Immaculate Conception standing on a globe while a voice commanded Catherine to have a medal made in imitation of what she saw,{{sfn|Mack|2003}} and the apparition marked the beginning of a great 19th-century Marian revival.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=29}} At the time the church was engaged in a struggle against  modernity and the promotion of its authority,{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=249}} and in 1849 Pope [[Pius IX]] asked the bishops of the church for their views on whether the doctrine should be defined as dogma: ninety percent of those who responded were supportive, and in 1854 the papal bull ''Ineffabilis Deus'' was promulgated.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}} (A dogma is a divinely revealed truth proclaimed by the Church and binding on the faithful as necessary to salvation).{{sfn|O'Collins|1983|p=162}}\n\n''Ineffabilis Deus'' was one of the pivotal events of the papacy of Pius, pope from 16 June 1846 to his death on 7 February 1878.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} Up until this point it had been understood that dogma had to be based in Scripture and acepted by tradition,{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} but Mary's immaculate conception is not stated in the New Testament and cannot be deduced from it,{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} and it had caused a virtual civil war between [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s during the middle ages.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=335}} ''Ineffabilis Deus'' therefore was a novelty, being based instead on the declaration of a special commission to the effect that neither scripture nor tradition were necessary to define dogma, but only the authority of the church expressed in the Pope.{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} The Pope and his [[curia]] (the special body which forms the central government of the church) accordingly waived the absence of scriptural proof or a \"broad and ancient\" stream of tradition and promulgated Mary's immaculate conception solely on [[papal infallibility]],{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204-205}} itself promulgated as dogma in 1870.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}} (Some catholics unable to accept papal infallibility left the Roman Church and formed the [[Old Catholic Church]], which rejects also the Immaculate Conception).{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Smit|2019|p=14,53}} Four years later, Mary reputedly appeared to the young [[Bernadette Soubirous]] at [[Loudes]] in southern France, to announce that she was the Immaculate Conception.{{sfn|Hammond|2003|p=602}}\n\nThe Archbishop of Paris had warned Pius that the Immaculate Conception \"could be proved neither from the Scriptures nor from tradition,\"{{sfn|Schaff|1931|p=unpaginated}} but ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' found it in the Ark of Salvation ([[Noah's Ark]]), [[Jacob's Ladder]], the [[Burning Bush]] at Sinai, the Enclosed Garden from the [[Song of Songs]], and many more.{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=35}} From this wealth of support the pope's advisors singled out [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]] as the basis for the Immaculate Conception: \"The most glorious Virgin ... was foretold by God when he said to the serpent: 'I will put enmity between you and the woman,'\"{{sfn|Manelli|1994|p=6-7}} a prophecy which reached fulfillment in the figure of the Woman in the [[Revelation of John]], crowned with stars and trampling the Dragon underfoot.{{sfn|Twomey|2008|p=73-74}} Luke 1:28, and specifically the phrase \"full of grace\" by which [[Gabriel]] greeted Mary, was another reference to her immaculate conception: \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction.\"{{sfn|German|2001|p=596}}\n\n==Feast and patronages==\n[[File:Quadrittu (cropped).jpg|thumb|The

Ireland by the 8th, although the earliest well-attested record in the Western church is from England early in the 11th.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It was suppressed there after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), and the first thorough exposition of the doctrine was a response to this suppression.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It continued to spread despite strong theological objections{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=128}} (in 1125 [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote to Lyons Cathedral to express his surprise and concern that it had recently begun to be observed there),{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} but in 1477 [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, placed it on the Roman calendar (i.e, list of Church festivals and observances).{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643}} [[Pius V]] suppressed it,{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=38}} but following the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' it was restored with the typically Franciscan phrase \"immaculate conception\" and given a formulary for the Mass, drawn largely from one composed for Sixtus IV, beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin...\". {{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643-644}}\n\nBy pontifical decree a number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception. These include [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea|Korea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]] (including the old kingdoms and the present state), the [[United States]] and [[Uruguay]]. By royal decree under the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], she is the principal Patroness of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Prayers and hymns==\nThe [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Rite]] [[Liturgy of the Hours]] naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \"[[Tota pulchra es|Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te]]\" (\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\" It continues: \"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun.

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the depiction of \"Our Lady\" seems to have been finally established by the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] in his  \"El arte de la pintura\" of 1649: a beautiful young girl of 12 or 13, wearing a white tunic and blue mantle, rays of light emanating from her head ringed by twelve stars and crowned by an imperial crown, the sun behind her and the moon beneath her feet.{{sfn|Moffitt|2001|p=676}} Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.{{sfn|Katz|Orsi|2001|p=98}} The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]].

The aim of the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of artificial consciousness is to \"Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact\" {{Harv|Aleksander|1995}}.\n\n[[Neuroscience]] hypothesizes that [[consciousness]] is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the [[brain]], called the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct [[system]]s (e.g., [[computer]] systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.<ref name=\"Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain\">{{cite book|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Consciousness and the Social Brain|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199928644}}</ref>\n\nArtificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of [[artificial intelligence]] through [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states?|questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states]].<ref>''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'' includes the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of AI including the questions of consciousness http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html, Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, 2003, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-790395-2}}</ref>\n\n==Philosophical views==\nAs there are many hypothesized [[Consciousness#Types of consciousness|types of consciousness]], there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness.  In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into \"access\" and \"phenomenal\" variants.  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of [[experience]] that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of \u201craw feels\u201d, \u201cwhat it is like\u201d or [[qualia]] ({{harvnb|Block|1997}}).\n\n=== Plausibility debate ===\n[[Type physicalism|Type-identity theorists]] and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can only be realized in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution ({{harvnb|Block|1978}}; {{harvnb|Bickle|2003}}).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schlagel | first1 = R.

A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components.\"<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=933500&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F2%2F20203%2F00933500 Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?] Buttazzo, Giorgio, July 2001, Computer, ISSN 0018-9162</ref>\n\nFor other theorists (e.g., [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalists]]), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness ({{harvnb|Putnam|1967}}).\n\n==== Computational Foundation argument ====\nOne of the most explicit arguments for the plausibility of AC comes from [[David Chalmers]].  His proposal, found within his article {{harvnb | Chalmers | 2011}}, is roughly that the right kinds of computations are sufficient for the possession of a conscious mind. In the outline, he defends his claim thus: Computers perform computations. Computations can capture other systems' abstract causal organization.\n\nThe most controversial part of Chalmers' proposal is that mental properties are \"organizationally invariant\". Mental properties are of two kinds, psychological and phenomenological. Psychological properties, such as belief and perception, are those that are \"characterized by their causal role\". He adverts to the work of {{harvnb|Armstrong|1968}} and {{harvnb|Lewis|1972}} in claiming that \"[s]ystems with the same causal topology\u2026will share their psychological properties\".\n\nPhenomenological properties are not prima facie definable in terms of their causal roles. Establishing that phenomenological properties are amenable to individuation by causal role therefore requires argument. Chalmers provides his Dancing Qualia Argument for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html|title=Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=1995|first=David|last=Chalmers}}</ref>\n\nChalmers begins by assuming that agents with identical causal organizations could have different experiences. He then asks us to conceive of changing one agent into the other by the replacement of parts (neural parts replaced by silicon, say) while preserving its causal organization. Ex hypothesi, the experience of the agent under transformation would change (as the parts were replaced), but there would be no change in causal topology and therefore no means whereby the agent could \"notice\" the shift in experience.\n\nCritics of AC object that Chalmers begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|Ethics of artificial intelligence|Machine ethics|Roboethics}}\nIf it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an [[ethics|ethical]] issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer of a building of larger machine is a particular ambiguity. Should [[law]]s be made for such a case? Consciousness would also require a legal definition in this particular case. Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction (see below).\n\nThe rules for the 2003 [[Loebner Prize]] competition explicitly addressed the question of robot rights:\n<blockquote>61. If, in any given year, a publicly available open source Entry entered by the University of Surrey or the Cambridge Center wins the Silver Medal or the Gold Medal, then the Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the body responsible for the development of that Entry. If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust ''until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right''.<ref>[http://loebner03.hamill.co.uk/docs/LPC%20Official%20Rules%20v2.0.pdf Loebner Prize Contest Official Rules \u2014 Version 2.0] The competition was directed by [[David Hamill]] and the rules were developed by members of the Robitron Yahoo group.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Research and implementation proposals ==\n\n=== Aspects of consciousness ===\nThere are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by [[Bernard Baars]] ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}) and others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control, Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function, Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness ({{harvnb|Aleksander|1995}}) and these are: The Brain is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered.\n\n==== Awareness ====\n[[Awareness]] could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of ''awareness''. The results of the experiments of [[Mirror neurons#In monkeys|neuroscanning on monkeys]] suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling of the physical world, modeling of one's own internal states and processes, and modeling of other conscious entities.\n\nThere are at least three types of awareness:<ref>Jo\u00eblle Proust in ''Neural Correlates of Consciousness'', Thomas Metzinger, 2000, MIT, pages 307-324</ref> agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it.  In goal awareness you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.  In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.\n\nBecause objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.<ref>Christof Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', 2004, page 2 footnote 2</ref>\n\n==== Memory ====\nConscious events interact with [[memory]] systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.<ref>Tulving, E. 1985. Memory and consciousness. Canadian Psychology 26:1-12</ref>\nThe IDA model<ref>Franklin, Stan, et al. \"The role of consciousness in memory.\" Brains, Minds and Media 1.1 (2005): 38.</ref> elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory,<ref>Franklin, Stan. \"Perceptual memory and learning: Recognizing, categorizing, and relating.\" Proc. Developmental Robotics AAAI Spring Symp. 2005.</ref> transient [[episodic memory]], and [[procedural memory]]. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA, there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system.<ref>Shastri, L. 2002. Episodic memory and cortico-hippocampal interactions. Trends in Cognitive Sciences</ref> In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of [[Pentti Kanerva|Kanerva]]\u2019s [[Sparse distributed memory]] architecture.<ref>Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.</ref>\n\n==== Learning ====\nLearning is also considered necessary for AC. By Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}). By [[Axel Cleeremans]] and Luis Jim\u00e9nez, learning is defined as \"a set of philogenetically {{sic}} advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments\" ({{harvnb|Cleeremans|2001}}).\n\n==== Anticipation ====\nThe ability to predict (or [[Anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipate]]) foreseeable events is considered important for AC by [[Igor Aleksander]].<ref name=\"Aleksander 1995\">Aleksander 1995</ref> The emergentist [[Multiple Drafts Model|multiple drafts principle]] proposed by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate \"draft\" to fit the current environment.  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.\n\nRelationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism enabling the organism to predict events.<ref name=\"Aleksander 1995\"/> An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.\n\n==== Subjective experience ====\nSubjective experiences or [[qualia]] are widely considered to be ''the'' [[hard problem of consciousness]]. Indeed, it is held to pose a challenge to [[physicalism]], let alone [[computationalism]]. On the other hand, there are problems in other fields of science which limit that which we can observe, such as the [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, which have not made the research in these fields of science impossible.\n\n=== Role of cognitive architectures ===\n{{Main|Cognitive architecture}}\n\nThe term \"cognitive architecture\" may refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind, or any portion or function thereof, including consciousness. In another context, a cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers. An example is ''QuBIC: Quantum and Bio-inspired Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness''. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so they can be the basis of a computer program. Also, the role of cognitive architecture is for the A.I. to clearly structure, build, and implement it's thought process.\n\n===Symbolic or hybrid proposals===\n\n====Franklin's Intelligent Distribution Agent====\n[[Stan Franklin]] (1995, 2003) defines an [[autonomous agent]] as possessing [[consciousness|functional consciousness]] when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness as identified by [[Bernard Baars]]' [[Global Workspace Theory]] {{Harvs|last=Baars|year=1988|year2=1997}}. His brain child IDA (Intelligent Distribution Agent) is a software implementation of GWT, which makes it functionally conscious by definition. IDA's task is to negotiate new assignments for sailors in the [[US Navy]] after they end a tour of duty, by matching each individual's skills and preferences with the Navy's needs. IDA interacts with Navy databases and communicates with the sailors via natural language e-mail dialog while obeying a large set of Navy policies. The IDA computational model was developed during 1996\u20132001 at Stan Franklin's \"Conscious\" Software Research Group at the [[University of Memphis]]. It \"consists of approximately a quarter-million lines of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code, and almost completely consumes the resources of a 2001 high-end workstation.\" It relies heavily on ''codelets'', which are \"special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread.\" In IDA's top-down architecture, high-level cognitive functions are explicitly modeled (see {{Harvnb|Franklin|1995}} and {{Harvnb|Franklin|2003}} for details). While IDA is functionally conscious by definition, Franklin does \"not attribute [[consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]] to his own 'conscious' software agent, IDA, in spite of her many human-like behaviours. This in spite of watching several US Navy detailers repeatedly nodding their heads saying 'Yes, that's how I do it' while watching IDA's internal and external actions as she performs her task.\" IDA has been extended to [[LIDA (cognitive architecture)|LIDA]] (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent).\n\n====Ron Sun's cognitive architecture CLARION====\n[[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]] posits a two-level representation that explains the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes.\n\nCLARION has been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological data. A number of well-known skill learning tasks have been simulated using CLARION that span the spectrum ranging from simple reactive skills to complex cognitive skills. The tasks include serial reaction time (SRT) tasks, artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, process control (PC) tasks, the categorical inference (CI) task, the alphabetical arithmetic (AA) task, and the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task {{Harv|Sun|2002}}. Among them, SRT, AGL, and PC are typical implicit learning tasks, very much relevant to the issue of consciousness as they operationalized the notion of consciousness in the context of psychological experiments.\n\n====Ben Goertzel's OpenCog====\n[[Ben Goertzel]] is pursuing an embodied AGI through the open-source [[OpenCog]] project. Current code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, being done at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]].\n\n===Connectionist proposals===\n\n====Haikonen's cognitive architecture====\nPentti {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: \"the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers.\" Rather than trying to achieve [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes \"a special [[cognitive architecture]] to reproduce the processes of [[perception]], [[Mental image|inner imagery]], [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]], [[pain]], [[pleasure]], [[emotions]] and the [[cognitive]] functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the [[artificial neuron]]s, without [[algorithms]] or [[computer program|programs]]\". Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be \"a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection.\" Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in [[autonomous agent]]s that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many, e.g. {{Harvtxt|Freeman|1999}} and {{Harvtxt|Cotterill|2003}}. A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. See {{Harvtxt|Doan|2009}} for a comprehensive introduction to Haikonen's cognitive architecture. An updated account of Haikonen's architecture, along with a summary of his philosophical views, is given in {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2012}}, {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2019}}.\n\n====Shanahan's cognitive architecture====\n[[Murray Shanahan]] describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars's idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation (\"imagination\") {{Harv|Shanahan|2006}}. For discussions of Shanahan's architecture, see {{Harv|Gamez|2008}} and {{Harv|Reggia|2013}} and Chapter 20 of {{Harv|Haikonen|2012}}.\n\n====Takeno's self-awareness research====\nSelf-awareness in robots is being investigated by Junichi Takeno<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |title=Robot |accessdate=2007-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703091242/http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 }}</ref> at [[Meiji University]] in Japan.

Takeno asserts that he first contrived the computational module called a MoNAD, which has a self-aware function, and he then constructed the artificial consciousness system by formulating the relationships between emotions, feelings and reason by connecting the modules in a hierarchy (Igarashi, Takeno 2007). Takeno completed a mirror image cognition experiment using a robot equipped with the MoNAD system. Takeno proposed the Self-Body Theory stating that \"humans feel that their own mirror image is closer to themselves than an actual part of themselves.\" The most important point in developing artificial consciousness or clarifying human consciousness is the development of a function of self awareness, and he claims that he has demonstrated physical and mathematical evidence for this in his thesis.<ref>[http://www.s2is.org/Issues/v1/n4/papers/paper4.pdf A Robot Succeeds in 100% Mirror Image Cognition], Takeno, 2008</ref> He also demonstrated that robots can study episodes in memory where the emotions were stimulated and use this experience to take predictive actions to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant emotions (Torigoe, Takeno 2009).\n\n====Aleksander's impossible mind====\n[[Igor Aleksander]], emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering at [[Imperial College]], has extensively researched [[artificial neural network]]s and claims in his book ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'' that the principles for creating a conscious machine already exist but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].<ref>Aleksander I (1996) ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'', Imperial College Press {{ISBN|1-86094-036-6}}</ref> Whether this is true remains to be demonstrated and the basic principle stated in ''Impossible Minds''\u2014that the brain is a [[finite state machine|neural state machine]]\u2014is open to doubt.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RJ | year = 1998 | title = review of ''Impossible Minds'' | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 115\u20136 }}</ref>\n\n====Thaler's Creativity Machine Paradigm====\nStephen Thaler proposed a possible connection between consciousness and creativity in his 1994 patent, called \"Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information\" (DAGUI),<ref name=\"dagui\">Thaler, S.L., \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20170313064154/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=5659666.PN.&OS=PN%2F5659666&RS=PN%2F5659666 Device for the autonomous generation of useful information]\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marupaka | first1 = N. | last2 = Lyer | first2 = L. | last3 = Minai | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Connectivity and thought: The influence of semantic network structure in a neurodynamical model of thinking | url = http://www.ece.uc.edu/~aminai/papers/marupaka_creativity_NN12.pdf | journal = Neural Networks | volume =  32| issue = | pages =  147\u2013158| doi = 10.1016/j.neunet.2012.02.004 | pmid = 22397950 }}</ref><ref>Roque, R. and Barreira, A.

When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one's own awareness is a schematized model of one's attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.\n\n=== \"Self-modeling\" ===\nIn order to be \"self-aware,\" robots may use internal models to [[Robotics simulator|simulate their own actions]].<ref>Bongard, Josh, Victor Zykov, and Hod Lipson. \"[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.1526&rep=rep1&type=pdf Resilient machines through continuous self-modeling].\" Science 314.5802 (2006): 1118-1121.</ref><ref>Winfield, Alan FT. \"[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/24467/1/Winfield_Chapter_in_ComputerAfterMe_finaldraft.pdf Robots with internal models: a route to self-aware and hence safer robots].\" (2014): 237-252.</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\nThe most well-known method for testing machine [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is the [[Turing test]]. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts the philosophy of science principles of [[Theory-ladenness|theory dependence of observations]]. It also has been suggested that Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a human adult consciousness, but a human child consciousness, should be taken seriously.<ref name=\"test\">[http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/AI_MAG_2011.pdf Mapping the Landscape of Human-Level Artificial General Intelligence]</ref>\n\nOther tests, such as [http://www.conscious-robots.com/consscale ConsScale], test the presence of features inspired by biological systems, or measure the cognitive development of artificial systems.\n\nQualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Although various systems may display various signs of behavior correlated with functional consciousness, there is no conceivable way in which third-person tests can have access to first-person phenomenological features. Because of that, and because there is no empirical definition of consciousness,<ref>\"Consciousness\". In Honderich T. The Oxford companion to philosophy. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-926479-7}}</ref> a test of presence of consciousness in AC may be impossible.\n\nIn 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51\u201370 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}</ref> He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures\u2019 consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine\u2019s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.\n\n==In fiction==\n{{Main|Simulated consciousness (science fiction)}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI}}\n\nCharacters with artificial consciousness (or at least with personalities that imply they have consciousness), from works of fiction:\n\n* Isaac \u2013 a member of the artificial, non-biological race from Kaylon-1 that views biological lifeforms, including humans, as inferior from the TV series ''[[The Orville]]''.\n* AC \u2013 created by merging two AIs in the ''[[Sprawl trilogy]]'' by [[William Gibson]]\n* [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] \u2013 in the simulated reality known as \"[[The Matrix]]\" in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' franchise]]\n** [[Agent Smith]] \u2013 began as an Agent in ''[[The Matrix]]'', then became a renegade program of overgrowing power that could make copies of itself like a self-replicating computer virus\n* A.L.I.E. \u2013 Sentient genocidal AI from the TV series ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]''\n* AM (Allied Mastercomputer) \u2013 the antagonist of [[Harlan Ellison]]{{'}}s short novel ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]''.

The aim of the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of artificial consciousness is to \"Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact\" {{Harv|Aleksander|1995}}.\n\n[[Neuroscience]] hypothesizes that [[consciousness]] is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the [[brain]], called the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct [[system]]s (e.g., [[computer]] systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.<ref name=\"Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain\">{{cite book|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Consciousness and the Social Brain|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199928644}}</ref>\n\nArtificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of [[artificial intelligence]] through [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states?|questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states]].<ref>''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'' includes the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of AI including the questions of consciousness http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html, Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, 2003, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-790395-2}}</ref>\n\n==Philosophical views==\nAs there are many hypothesized [[Consciousness#Types of consciousness|types of consciousness]], there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness.  In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into \"access\" and \"phenomenal\" variants.  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of [[experience]] that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of \u201craw feels\u201d, \u201cwhat it is like\u201d or [[qualia]] ({{harvnb|Block|1997}}).\n\n=== Plausibility debate ===\n[[Type physicalism|Type-identity theorists]] and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can only be realized in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution ({{harvnb|Block|1978}}; {{harvnb|Bickle|2003}}).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schlagel | first1 = R.

A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components.\"<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=933500&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F2%2F20203%2F00933500 Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?] Buttazzo, Giorgio, July 2001, Computer, ISSN 0018-9162</ref>\n\nFor other theorists (e.g., [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalists]]), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness ({{harvnb|Putnam|1967}}).\n\n==== Computational Foundation argument ====\nOne of the most explicit arguments for the plausibility of AC comes from [[David Chalmers]].  His proposal, found within his article {{harvnb | Chalmers | 2011}}, is roughly that the right kinds of computations are sufficient for the possession of a conscious mind. In the outline, he defends his claim thus: Computers perform computations. Computations can capture other systems' abstract causal organization.\n\nThe most controversial part of Chalmers' proposal is that mental properties are \"organizationally invariant\". Mental properties are of two kinds, psychological and phenomenological. Psychological properties, such as belief and perception, are those that are \"characterized by their causal role\". He adverts to the work of {{harvnb|Armstrong|1968}} and {{harvnb|Lewis|1972}} in claiming that \"[s]ystems with the same causal topology\u2026will share their psychological properties\".\n\nPhenomenological properties are not prima facie definable in terms of their causal roles. Establishing that phenomenological properties are amenable to individuation by causal role therefore requires argument. Chalmers provides his Dancing Qualia Argument for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html|title=Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=1995|first=David|last=Chalmers}}</ref>\n\nChalmers begins by assuming that agents with identical causal organizations could have different experiences. He then asks us to conceive of changing one agent into the other by the replacement of parts (neural parts replaced by silicon, say) while preserving its causal organization. Ex hypothesi, the experience of the agent under transformation would change (as the parts were replaced), but there would be no change in causal topology and therefore no means whereby the agent could \"notice\" the shift in experience.\n\nCritics of AC object that Chalmers begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|Ethics of artificial intelligence|Machine ethics|Roboethics}}\nIf it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an [[ethics|ethical]] issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer of a building of larger machine is a particular ambiguity. Should [[law]]s be made for such a case? Consciousness would also require a legal definition in this particular case. Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction (see below).\n\nThe rules for the 2003 [[Loebner Prize]] competition explicitly addressed the question of robot rights:\n<blockquote>61. If, in any given year, a publicly available open source Entry entered by the University of Surrey or the Cambridge Center wins the Silver Medal or the Gold Medal, then the Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the body responsible for the development of that Entry. If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust ''until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right''.<ref>[http://loebner03.hamill.co.uk/docs/LPC%20Official%20Rules%20v2.0.pdf Loebner Prize Contest Official Rules \u2014 Version 2.0] The competition was directed by [[David Hamill]] and the rules were developed by members of the Robitron Yahoo group.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Research and implementation proposals ==\n\n=== Aspects of consciousness ===\nThere are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by [[Bernard Baars]] ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}) and others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control, Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function, Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness ({{harvnb|Aleksander|1995}}) and these are: The Brain is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered.\n\n==== Awareness ====\n[[Awareness]] could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of ''awareness''. The results of the experiments of [[Mirror neurons#In monkeys|neuroscanning on monkeys]] suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling of the physical world, modeling of one's own internal states and processes, and modeling of other conscious entities.\n\nThere are at least three types of awareness:<ref>Jo\u00eblle Proust in ''Neural Correlates of Consciousness'', Thomas Metzinger, 2000, MIT, pages 307-324</ref> agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it.  In goal awareness you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.  In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.\n\nBecause objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.<ref>Christof Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', 2004, page 2 footnote 2</ref>\n\n==== Memory ====\nConscious events interact with [[memory]] systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.<ref>Tulving, E. 1985. Memory and consciousness. Canadian Psychology 26:1-12</ref>\nThe IDA model<ref>Franklin, Stan, et al. \"The role of consciousness in memory.\" Brains, Minds and Media 1.1 (2005): 38.</ref> elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory,<ref>Franklin, Stan. \"Perceptual memory and learning: Recognizing, categorizing, and relating.\" Proc. Developmental Robotics AAAI Spring Symp. 2005.</ref> transient [[episodic memory]], and [[procedural memory]]. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA, there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system.<ref>Shastri, L. 2002. Episodic memory and cortico-hippocampal interactions. Trends in Cognitive Sciences</ref> In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of [[Pentti Kanerva|Kanerva]]\u2019s [[Sparse distributed memory]] architecture.<ref>Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.</ref>\n\n==== Learning ====\nLearning is also considered necessary for AC. By Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}). By [[Axel Cleeremans]] and Luis Jim\u00e9nez, learning is defined as \"a set of philogenetically {{sic}} advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments\" ({{harvnb|Cleeremans|2001}}).\n\n==== Anticipation ====\nThe ability to predict (or [[Anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipate]]) foreseeable events is considered important for AC by [[Igor Aleksander]].<ref name=\"Aleksander 1995\">Aleksander 1995</ref> The emergentist [[Multiple Drafts Model|multiple drafts principle]] proposed by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate \"draft\" to fit the current environment.  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.\n\nRelationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism enabling the organism to predict events.<ref name=\"Aleksander 1995\"/> An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.\n\n==== Subjective experience ====\nSubjective experiences or [[qualia]] are widely considered to be ''the'' [[hard problem of consciousness]]. Indeed, it is held to pose a challenge to [[physicalism]], let alone [[computationalism]]. On the other hand, there are problems in other fields of science which limit that which we can observe, such as the [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, which have not made the research in these fields of science impossible.\n\n=== Role of cognitive architectures ===\n{{Main|Cognitive architecture}}\n\nThe term \"cognitive architecture\" may refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind, or any portion or function thereof, including consciousness. In another context, a cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers. An example is ''QuBIC: Quantum and Bio-inspired Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness''. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so they can be the basis of a computer program. Also, the role of cognitive architecture is for the A.I. to clearly structure, build, and implement it's thought process.\n\n===Symbolic or hybrid proposals===\n\n====Franklin's Intelligent Distribution Agent====\n[[Stan Franklin]] (1995, 2003) defines an [[autonomous agent]] as possessing [[consciousness|functional consciousness]] when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness as identified by [[Bernard Baars]]' [[Global Workspace Theory]] {{Harvs|last=Baars|year=1988|year2=1997}}. His brain child IDA (Intelligent Distribution Agent) is a software implementation of GWT, which makes it functionally conscious by definition. IDA's task is to negotiate new assignments for sailors in the [[US Navy]] after they end a tour of duty, by matching each individual's skills and preferences with the Navy's needs. IDA interacts with Navy databases and communicates with the sailors via natural language e-mail dialog while obeying a large set of Navy policies. The IDA computational model was developed during 1996\u20132001 at Stan Franklin's \"Conscious\" Software Research Group at the [[University of Memphis]]. It \"consists of approximately a quarter-million lines of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code, and almost completely consumes the resources of a 2001 high-end workstation.\" It relies heavily on ''codelets'', which are \"special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread.\" In IDA's top-down architecture, high-level cognitive functions are explicitly modeled (see {{Harvnb|Franklin|1995}} and {{Harvnb|Franklin|2003}} for details). While IDA is functionally conscious by definition, Franklin does \"not attribute [[consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]] to his own 'conscious' software agent, IDA, in spite of her many human-like behaviours. This in spite of watching several US Navy detailers repeatedly nodding their heads saying 'Yes, that's how I do it' while watching IDA's internal and external actions as she performs her task.\" IDA has been extended to [[LIDA (cognitive architecture)|LIDA]] (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent).\n\n====Ron Sun's cognitive architecture CLARION====\n[[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]] posits a two-level representation that explains the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes.\n\nCLARION has been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological data. A number of well-known skill learning tasks have been simulated using CLARION that span the spectrum ranging from simple reactive skills to complex cognitive skills. The tasks include serial reaction time (SRT) tasks, artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, process control (PC) tasks, the categorical inference (CI) task, the alphabetical arithmetic (AA) task, and the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task {{Harv|Sun|2002}}. Among them, SRT, AGL, and PC are typical implicit learning tasks, very much relevant to the issue of consciousness as they operationalized the notion of consciousness in the context of psychological experiments.\n\n====Ben Goertzel's OpenCog====\n[[Ben Goertzel]] is pursuing an embodied AGI through the open-source [[OpenCog]] project. Current code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, being done at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]].\n\n===Connectionist proposals===\n\n====Haikonen's cognitive architecture====\nPentti {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: \"the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers.\" Rather than trying to achieve [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes \"a special [[cognitive architecture]] to reproduce the processes of [[perception]], [[Mental image|inner imagery]], [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]], [[pain]], [[pleasure]], [[emotions]] and the [[cognitive]] functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the [[artificial neuron]]s, without [[algorithms]] or [[computer program|programs]]\". Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be \"a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection.\" Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in [[autonomous agent]]s that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many, e.g. {{Harvtxt|Freeman|1999}} and {{Harvtxt|Cotterill|2003}}. A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. See {{Harvtxt|Doan|2009}} for a comprehensive introduction to Haikonen's cognitive architecture. An updated account of Haikonen's architecture, along with a summary of his philosophical views, is given in {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2012}}, {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2019}}.\n\n====Shanahan's cognitive architecture====\n[[Murray Shanahan]] describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars's idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation (\"imagination\") {{Harv|Shanahan|2006}}. For discussions of Shanahan's architecture, see {{Harv|Gamez|2008}} and {{Harv|Reggia|2013}} and Chapter 20 of {{Harv|Haikonen|2012}}.\n\n====Takeno's self-awareness research====\nSelf-awareness in robots is being investigated by Junichi Takeno<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |title=Robot |accessdate=2007-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703091242/http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 }}</ref> at [[Meiji University]] in Japan.

Takeno asserts that he first contrived the computational module called a MoNAD, which has a self-aware function, and he then constructed the artificial consciousness system by formulating the relationships between emotions, feelings and reason by connecting the modules in a hierarchy (Igarashi, Takeno 2007). Takeno completed a mirror image cognition experiment using a robot equipped with the MoNAD system. Takeno proposed the Self-Body Theory stating that \"humans feel that their own mirror image is closer to themselves than an actual part of themselves.\" The most important point in developing artificial consciousness or clarifying human consciousness is the development of a function of self awareness, and he claims that he has demonstrated physical and mathematical evidence for this in his thesis.<ref>[http://www.s2is.org/Issues/v1/n4/papers/paper4.pdf A Robot Succeeds in 100% Mirror Image Cognition], Takeno, 2008</ref> He also demonstrated that robots can study episodes in memory where the emotions were stimulated and use this experience to take predictive actions to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant emotions (Torigoe, Takeno 2009).\n\n====Aleksander's impossible mind====\n[[Igor Aleksander]], emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering at [[Imperial College]], has extensively researched [[artificial neural network]]s and claims in his book ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'' that the principles for creating a conscious machine already exist but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].<ref>Aleksander I (1996) ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'', Imperial College Press {{ISBN|1-86094-036-6}}</ref> Whether this is true remains to be demonstrated and the basic principle stated in ''Impossible Minds''\u2014that the brain is a [[finite state machine|neural state machine]]\u2014is open to doubt.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RJ | year = 1998 | title = review of ''Impossible Minds'' | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 115\u20136 }}</ref>\n\n====Thaler's Creativity Machine Paradigm====\nStephen Thaler proposed a possible connection between consciousness and creativity in his 1994 patent, called \"Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information\" (DAGUI),<ref name=\"dagui\">Thaler, S.L., \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20170313064154/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=5659666.PN.&OS=PN%2F5659666&RS=PN%2F5659666 Device for the autonomous generation of useful information]\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marupaka | first1 = N. | last2 = Lyer | first2 = L. | last3 = Minai | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Connectivity and thought: The influence of semantic network structure in a neurodynamical model of thinking | url = http://www.ece.uc.edu/~aminai/papers/marupaka_creativity_NN12.pdf | journal = Neural Networks | volume =  32| issue = | pages =  147\u2013158| doi = 10.1016/j.neunet.2012.02.004 | pmid = 22397950 }}</ref><ref>Roque, R. and Barreira, A.

When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one's own awareness is a schematized model of one's attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.\n\n=== \"Self-modeling\" ===\nIn order to be \"self-aware,\" robots may use internal models to [[Robotics simulator|simulate their own actions]].<ref>Bongard, Josh, Victor Zykov, and Hod Lipson. \"[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.460.1526&rep=rep1&type=pdf Resilient machines through continuous self-modeling].\" Science 314.5802 (2006): 1118-1121.</ref><ref>Winfield, Alan FT. \"[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/24467/1/Winfield_Chapter_in_ComputerAfterMe_finaldraft.pdf Robots with internal models: a route to self-aware and hence safer robots].\" (2014): 237-252.</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\nThe most well-known method for testing machine [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is the [[Turing test]]. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts the philosophy of science principles of [[Theory-ladenness|theory dependence of observations]]. It also has been suggested that Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a human adult consciousness, but a human child consciousness, should be taken seriously.<ref name=\"test\">[http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/AI_MAG_2011.pdf Mapping the Landscape of Human-Level Artificial General Intelligence]</ref>\n\nOther tests, such as [http://www.conscious-robots.com/consscale ConsScale], test the presence of features inspired by biological systems, or measure the cognitive development of artificial systems.\n\nQualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Although various systems may display various signs of behavior correlated with functional consciousness, there is no conceivable way in which third-person tests can have access to first-person phenomenological features. Because of that, and because there is no empirical definition of consciousness,<ref>\"Consciousness\". In Honderich T. The Oxford companion to philosophy. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-926479-7}}</ref> a test of presence of consciousness in AC may be impossible.\n\nIn 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51\u201370 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}</ref> He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures\u2019 consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine\u2019s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.\n\n==In fiction==\n{{Main|Simulated consciousness (science fiction)}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI}}\n\nCharacters with artificial consciousness (or at least with personalities that imply they have consciousness), from works of fiction:\n\n* Isaac \u2013 a member of the artificial, non-biological race from Kaylon-1 that views biological lifeforms, including humans, as inferior from the TV series ''[[The Orville]]''.\n* AC \u2013 created by merging two AIs in the ''[[Sprawl trilogy]]'' by [[William Gibson]]\n* [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] \u2013 in the simulated reality known as \"[[The Matrix]]\" in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' franchise]]\n** [[Agent Smith]] \u2013 began as an Agent in ''[[The Matrix]]'', then became a renegade program of overgrowing power that could make copies of itself like a self-replicating computer virus\n* A.L.I.E. \u2013 Sentient genocidal AI from the TV series ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]''\n* AM (Allied Mastercomputer) \u2013 the antagonist of [[Harlan Ellison]]{{'}}s short novel ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]''.

Born and raised in [[Buffalo, New York]], James began his musical career in his teen years. He was in various bands before entering the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and to avoid [[conscription|being drafted]] in 1964, James [[desertion|deserted]] to [[Toronto]], Canada, where he formed the rock band [[the Mynah Birds]], who eventually signed a recording deal with [[Motown|Motown Records]] in 1966. James' career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted James to a one-year prison term related to the draft charges. After being released, James moved to California where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nAfter forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's [[Gordy Records]], releasing the album ''[[Come Get It!]]'' in 1978 which produced the hits \"[[You and I (Rick James song)|You & I]]\" and \"[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]].\" In 1981, James released his most successful album, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which included career-defining hits such as \"[[Give It to Me Baby]]\" and \"[[Super Freak]],\" the latter song becoming his biggest [[Crossover music|crossover single]], mixing elements of funk, disco, rock and [[new wave music|new wave]]. James was also known for his [[soul music|soulful]] ballads such as \"Fire & Desire\" and \"[[Ebony Eyes (Rick James song)|Ebony Eyes]].\" In addition, James also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including [[Teena Marie]], the [[Mary Jane Girls]], [[the Temptations]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Smokey Robinson]].\n\nJames' mainstream success had peaked with the release of his album ''[[Glow (Rick James album)|Glow]]'' in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, ''[[The A-Team]]''. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper [[MC Hammer]] sampled James' \"Super Freak\" for his 1990 hit, \"[[U Can't Touch This]]\" which won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]]. James received his only Grammy for composing the song.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/rick-james|title=Rick James|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> By the early 1990s, James' career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled with legal issues. In 1993, James was convicted for two separate instances of kidnapping and torturing two different women while under the influence of [[crack cocaine]], resulting in a three-year sentence at [[Folsom State Prison]]. James was released on parole in 1996 and released the album ''[[Urban Rapsody]]'' in 1997. James's health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\n\nIn 2004, James's career returned to mainstream [[Popular culture|pop culture]] after he appeared in an episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. The segment involved a [[Charlie Murphy]] ''[[E! True Hollywood Story|True Hollywood Stories]]''-style skit that satirized James' wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. James died later that year from [[heart failure]] at age 56.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Early life ===\nJohnson was born on February 1, 1948, in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Mabel (n\u00e9e Sims) and James Ambrose Johnson Sr. He was one of eight children. James's father, an autoworker, left the family when James was 10.

In 1965, the band briefly recorded for the Canadian division of [[Columbia Records]], releasing the single, \"Mynah Bird Hop\"/\"Mynah Bird Song\". At one point, [[Nick St. Nicholas]] of later [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] fame was a member; eventually bassist [[Bruce Palmer]] replaced him by the time \"Mynah Bird Hop\" was recorded. James and Palmer recruited guitarists Tom Morgan and Xavier Taylor and drummer Rick Mason to form a new Mynah Birds lineup, and soon traveled to [[Detroit]] to record with [[Motown]]. Before the group began recording their first songs for the label, Morgan left, unhappy about the label's attitude towards the musicians. Neil Young eventually took his place. It was while in Detroit that James met his musical heroes, [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. After meeting Wonder and telling him his name, Wonder felt the name \"Ricky James Matthews\" was \"too long\", and instead told James to shorten it to \"Ricky James\".<ref name=\"glowreview\" />\n\nIn 1966, a financial dispute in Toronto between James and the Mynah Birds' handler, Morley Shelman<ref name=\"Benjaminson, p. 42\">Benjaminson, p. 42</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2012/04/mynah-birds-in-depth-exclusive.html|title=Neil Young News: The Mynah Birds: An In Depth Exclusive|website=neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Durchholz, p. 23\">Durchholz, p. 23</ref> led to Motown's learning of James's fugitive status with the Navy.

With help from his mother, James found legal assistance from his cousin, future Congressman [[Louis Stokes]] and an attorney, former Marine Captain John Bracken, who pled James' second [[court-martial]] down from a potential five years' hard labor to five months.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /><ref>Benjaminson, pp. 43-47</ref> After his release from [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in August 1967, James returned to Toronto<ref>Benjaminson, pp. 47-48</ref> and endured another detention, initially derailing resumption of his career with Mynah Bird bandmate [[Neil Merryweather]], with whom he would later collaborate, first at Motown and then in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"Durchholz, p. 23\"/><ref>Bejaminson pp. 50, 53</ref>\n\nIn 1968, again working under the pseudonym Ricky Matthews, James produced and wrote songs at Motown for acts such as [[The Miracles]], [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]]. According to James, he briefly got involved in [[procuring (prostitution)|pimp activity]] during this time, but stopped because he felt he was not qualified for it due to the harsh activity and the abuse of women there.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> It was during this third stint at Motown that James met musician [[Greg Reeves]]. Reeves, hoping to find a better situation than the [[United States dollar|US$]]38 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|85|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) he was earning as a session bassist for [[Berry Gordy]], joined James, looking to \"hitch a lift from Neil Young's rising star,\" and relocated to Los Angeles.<ref>Bejaminson pp. 56</ref> \n\nOn one of his first night in Los Angeles, James was crashing on musician [[Stephen Stills]]' couch. When he awoke he saw a stoned young man sitting on the floor in the [[lotus position]]. The man's wrists were bleeding so a scared James sought help. James was later formally introduced to the man who was [[Jim Morrison]], lead singer of [[the Doors]]. After the Doors opened for [[Buffalo Springfield]] at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], Morrison tricked James into taking [[Acid (drug)|acid]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn California, James initially worked as a duo with Greg Reeves, but soon after James introduced Reeves to Neil Young, it was Reeves, not James, who was hired as bassist for the newly formed rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].<ref name=\"glowreview\" /><ref name=\"nickwarburton.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nickwarburton.com/wordpress/?cat=7|title=Rick James's Early Years|website=nickwarburton.com |accessdate=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Around this time James formed several versions of the rock band Salt'N'Pepper<ref name=\"nickwarburton.com\" /> and got involved with [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] [[Jay Sebring]], who agreed to invest in his music.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> In 1969, James claimed that Sebring invited him to attend a party at actress [[Sharon Tate]]\u2019s house, but he was too [[Hangover|hungover]] to get out of bed.

The duo also recorded as part of the group Heaven and Earth in Toronto. Heaven and Earth eventually changed their name to Great White Cane and recorded a self-titled album for the Los Angeles label Lion Records, released in 1972. James formed another band, Hot Lips, afterwards.\n\n=== Solo career ===\nIn 1973, James signed with [[A&M Records]], where his first single under the name Rick James, \"My Mama\", was released in 1974, becoming a club hit in Europe.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> \n\nIn 1976, James returned to Buffalo, New York, and formed the Stone City Band and recorded the song \"Get Up and Dance!\", which was his second single to be released. In 1977, James and the Stone City Band signed a contract with Motown's Gordy Records imprint, where they began recording their first album in New York City.\n\nIn April 1978, James released his debut solo album, ''[[Come Get It!]]'', which included the Stone City Band. The album launched the top 20 hit, \"[[You and I (Rick James song)|You and I]]\", which became his first number-one R&B hit. The album also included the hit single, \"[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]\". It eventually sold two million copies, launching James's musical career to stardom, and helping out Motown Records at a time when label fortunes had dwindled.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Bob|url=https://archive.org/details/michaeljacksonma00jone|url-access=registration|quote=sold over 1 million copies.

A third album, ''[[Fire It Up (Rick James album)|Fire It Up]]'', was released in late 1979 going [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|gold]]. Around that same period, James launched his first headlining tour, the Fire It Up Tour, and agreed to invite the then-upcoming artist, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], as well as singer [[Teena Marie]], as his opening act.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> James had produced Marie's successful Motown debut album, ''[[Wild and Peaceful (Teena Marie album)|Wild and Peaceful]]'' and was featured on the hit duet, \"I'm a Sucker (For Your Love)\". James was credited with naming Marie, \"Lady Tee\", on the song, a nickname that stuck with Marie for the rest of her career. The Fire It Up tour led to James developing a bitter rivalry with Prince, after he accused the musician of ripping off his act.<ref name=\"glowreview\" />\n\n{{listen\n| Type           = single\n| filename       = Rick James - Super Freak excerpt.ogg\n| format         = [[Ogg]]\n| title          = \"Super Freak\"}}\n\nFollowing the end of the tour in 1980, James released the ballads-heavy ''[[Garden of Love (album)|Garden of Love]]'', which became his fourth gold record. In 1981, James recorded his best-selling album to date, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which like his previous four albums, was a [[concept album]]. ''Street Songs'' featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and [[new wave music|new wave]], as well as James's brand of crossover funk, enabling James's own style of \"punk funk\". The album featured hit singles such as \"[[Ghetto Life (song)|Ghetto Life]]\", the Teena Marie duet \"Fire and Desire\", \"[[Give It to Me Baby]]\", and his biggest crossover hit to date, \"[[Super Freak]]\", which peaked at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and sold over 1 million copies. ''Street Songs'' peaked at number one R&B and number three pop, and sold over 3 million copies alone in the United States.<ref name=\":4\" /> Following up that success, James released two more gold albums, 1982's ''[[Throwin' Down]]'' and 1983's ''[[Cold Blooded (Rick James album)|Cold Blooded]]''.\n\nDuring this period, envious of Prince's success as producer of other acts including [[The Time (band)|The Time]] and [[Vanity 6]], James launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the [[Mary Jane Girls]], featuring his former background singer Joanne \"JoJo\" McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, \"[[All Night Long (Mary Jane Girls song)|All Night Long]]\", \"Candy Man\", and \"[[In My House]]\". In 1982, James produced the Temptations' Top 10 R&B hit, \"[[Standing On The Top (song)|Standing On The Top]]\". In 1983, James recorded the hit duet, \"Ebony Eyes\", with singer [[Smokey Robinson]], as well as a ballad \"Tell Me What You Want\" with an introduction by Billy Dee Williams. In 1985, James produced another hit for entertainer [[Eddie Murphy]] with the song \"[[Party All the Time]]\". That same year he appeared on an episode of ''[[The A-Team]]'' with [[Isaac Hayes]]. After the release of his ninth solo album, ''[[The Flag (album)|The Flag]]'', in 1986, James signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which released the album ''[[Wonderful (Rick James album)|Wonderful]]'' in 1988, featuring the hit, \"Loosey's Rap\".\n\nJames's controversial and provocative image became troublesome sometimes. Famous for promoting the use of [[marijuana]] live in concerts during a time that simple possession could lead to a long term prison sentence, James was often threatened by cops in various cities that he would be arrested if he smoked marijuana on stage during performances of songs such as \"Fire It Up\" and \"Mary Jane\". According to Kerry Gordy, most Motown executives erroneously thought the latter song was a \"simple cute love song to a girl\" not knowing the song was about marijuana.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nJames' overtly sexual bravado made it tough for him to be a bigger mainstream act. After the debut of the fledgling music video network [[MTV]] in August of 1981, James tried to present the music video to \"Super Freak\" to the label, only for the channel to turn the video down. James accused the network of racism.{{sfn|Denisof|1988|pp=69\u201371}} MTV denied this, stating the real reason \"Super Freak\" was turned down by MTV was because they felt James' video was too vulgar for the channel. When younger artists such as Prince and [[Michael Jackson]] found fame on the channel, James accused the two singers of being \"tokens\" in a 1983 interview, demanding that any black artist that has a video aired on MTV take their video off the channel in protest. James' rant was cosigned by [[David Bowie]], who argued with an MTV veejay about the lack of black artists being featured on the channel despite the successes of Jackson and Prince.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nWhen MTV and [[BET]] both avoided playing the video for \"Loosey's Rap\" because of its graphic sexual content, James considered the networks hypocritical in light of them still playing provocative videos by artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Decline ===\nIn 1989, James's 11th album, ''[[Kickin' (Rick James album)|Kickin'<nowiki/>]]'', was released only in the UK. By 1990, he had lost his deal with Warner Bros. and James began struggling with personal and legal troubles. That year [[MC Hammer]] released his hit [[signature song]], \"[[U Can't Touch This]]\", which sampled the prominent opening riff from \"[[Super Freak]].\" James and his co-writer on \"[[Super Freak]],\" Alonzo Miller, successfully sued Hammer for shared songwriting credit and all three consequently received a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1991.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 20, 1990|title=M.C.

Born and raised in [[Buffalo, New York]], James began his musical career in his teen years. He was in various bands before entering the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and to avoid [[conscription|being drafted]] in 1964, James [[desertion|deserted]] to [[Toronto]], Canada, where he formed the rock band [[the Mynah Birds]], who eventually signed a recording deal with [[Motown|Motown Records]] in 1966. James' career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted James to a one-year prison term related to the draft charges. After being released, James moved to California where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nAfter forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's [[Gordy Records]], releasing the album ''[[Come Get It!]]'' in 1978 which produced the hits \"[[You and I (Rick James song)|You & I]]\" and \"[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]].\" In 1981, James released his most successful album, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which included career-defining hits such as \"[[Give It to Me Baby]]\" and \"[[Super Freak]],\" the latter song becoming his biggest [[Crossover music|crossover single]], mixing elements of funk, disco, rock and [[new wave music|new wave]]. James was also known for his [[soul music|soulful]] ballads such as \"Fire & Desire\" and \"[[Ebony Eyes (Rick James song)|Ebony Eyes]].\" In addition, James also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including [[Teena Marie]], the [[Mary Jane Girls]], [[the Temptations]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Smokey Robinson]].\n\nJames' mainstream success had peaked with the release of his album ''[[Glow (Rick James album)|Glow]]'' in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, ''[[The A-Team]]''. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper [[MC Hammer]] sampled James' \"Super Freak\" for his 1990 hit, \"[[U Can't Touch This]]\" which won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]]. James received his only Grammy for composing the song.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/rick-james|title=Rick James|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> By the early 1990s, James' career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled with legal issues. In 1993, James was convicted for two separate instances of kidnapping and torturing two different women while under the influence of [[crack cocaine]], resulting in a three-year sentence at [[Folsom State Prison]]. James was released on parole in 1996 and released the album ''[[Urban Rapsody]]'' in 1997. James's health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\n\nIn 2004, James's career returned to mainstream [[Popular culture|pop culture]] after he appeared in an episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. The segment involved a [[Charlie Murphy]] ''[[E! True Hollywood Story|True Hollywood Stories]]''-style skit that satirized James' wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. James died later that year from [[heart failure]] at age 56.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Early life ===\nJohnson was born on February 1, 1948, in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Mabel (n\u00e9e Sims) and James Ambrose Johnson Sr. He was one of eight children.

In 1965, the band briefly recorded for the Canadian division of [[Columbia Records]], releasing the single, \"Mynah Bird Hop\"/\"Mynah Bird Song\". At one point, [[Nick St. Nicholas]] of later [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] fame was a member; eventually bassist [[Bruce Palmer]] replaced him by the time \"Mynah Bird Hop\" was recorded. James and Palmer recruited guitarists Tom Morgan and Xavier Taylor and drummer Rick Mason to form a new Mynah Birds lineup, and soon traveled to [[Detroit]] to record with [[Motown]]. Before the group began recording their first songs for the label, Morgan left, unhappy about the label's attitude towards the musicians. Neil Young eventually took his place. It was while in Detroit that James met his musical heroes, [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. After meeting Wonder and telling him his name, Wonder felt the name \"Ricky James Matthews\" was \"too long\", and instead told James to shorten it to \"Ricky James\".<ref name=\"glowreview\" />\n\nIn 1966, a financial dispute in Toronto between James and the Mynah Birds' handler, Morley Shelman<ref name=\"Benjaminson, p. 42\">Benjaminson, p. 42</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2012/04/mynah-birds-in-depth-exclusive.html|title=Neil Young News: The Mynah Birds: An In Depth Exclusive|website=neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Durchholz, p. 23\">Durchholz, p. 23</ref> led to Motown's learning of James's fugitive status with the Navy.

He was not yet 19 years old. James escaped from the Brooklyn Naval Brig after only six weeks' confinement, but following another six months [[Fugitive|on the lam]], surrendered himself a second time. With help from his mother, James found legal assistance from his cousin, future Congressman [[Louis Stokes]] and an attorney, former Marine Captain John Bracken, who pled James' second [[court-martial]] down from a potential five years' hard labor to five months.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /><ref>Benjaminson, pp. 43-47</ref> After his release from [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in August 1967, James returned to Toronto<ref>Benjaminson, pp. 47-48</ref> and endured another detention, initially derailing resumption of his career with Mynah Bird bandmate [[Neil Merryweather]], with whom he would later collaborate, first at Motown and then in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"Durchholz, p. 23\"/><ref>Bejaminson pp. 50, 53</ref>\n\nIn 1968, again working under the pseudonym Ricky Matthews, James produced and wrote songs at Motown for acts such as [[The Miracles]], [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]]. According to James, he briefly got involved in [[procuring (prostitution)|pimp activity]] during this time, but stopped because he felt he was not qualified for it due to the harsh activity and the abuse of women there.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> It was during this third stint at Motown that James met musician [[Greg Reeves]]. Reeves, hoping to find a better situation than the [[United States dollar|US$]]38 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|85|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) he was earning as a session bassist for [[Berry Gordy]], joined James, looking to \"hitch a lift from Neil Young's rising star,\" and relocated to Los Angeles.<ref>Bejaminson pp. 56</ref> \n\nOn one of his first night in Los Angeles, James was crashing on musician [[Stephen Stills]]' couch. When he awoke he saw a stoned young man sitting on the floor in the [[lotus position]]. The man's wrists were bleeding so a scared James sought help. James was later formally introduced to the man who was [[Jim Morrison]], lead singer of [[the Doors]]. After the Doors opened for [[Buffalo Springfield]] at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], Morrison tricked James into taking [[Acid (drug)|acid]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn California, James initially worked as a duo with Greg Reeves, but soon after James introduced Reeves to Neil Young, it was Reeves, not James, who was hired as bassist for the newly formed rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].<ref name=\"glowreview\" /><ref name=\"nickwarburton.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nickwarburton.com/wordpress/?cat=7|title=Rick James's Early Years|website=nickwarburton.com |accessdate=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Around this time James formed several versions of the rock band Salt'N'Pepper<ref name=\"nickwarburton.com\" /> and got involved with [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] [[Jay Sebring]], who agreed to invest in his music.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> In 1969, James claimed that Sebring invited him to attend a party at actress [[Sharon Tate]]\u2019s house, but he was too [[Hangover|hungover]] to get out of bed. The next morning he discovered that Sebring had been [[Tate murders|murdered]] when he saw the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' headline \"Sharon Tate, Four Others Murdered.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1970, James and Salt'N'Pepper member Ed Roth later were included in Bruce Palmer's solo album ''[[The Cycle Is Complete|The Cycle is Complete]]''. The duo also recorded as part of the group Heaven and Earth in Toronto. Heaven and Earth eventually changed their name to Great White Cane and recorded a self-titled album for the Los Angeles label Lion Records, released in 1972. James formed another band, Hot Lips, afterwards.\n\n=== Solo career ===\nIn 1973, James signed with [[A&M Records]], where his first single under the name Rick James, \"My Mama\", was released in 1974, becoming a club hit in Europe.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> \n\nIn 1976, James returned to Buffalo, New York, and formed the Stone City Band and recorded the song \"Get Up and Dance!\", which was his second single to be released. In 1977, James and the Stone City Band signed a contract with Motown's Gordy Records imprint, where they began recording their first album in New York City.\n\nIn April 1978, James released his debut solo album, ''[[Come Get It!]]'', which included the Stone City Band. The album launched the top 20 hit, \"[[You and I (Rick James song)|You and I]]\", which became his first number-one R&B hit. The album also included the hit single, \"[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]\". It eventually sold two million copies, launching James's musical career to stardom, and helping out Motown Records at a time when label fortunes had dwindled.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=Bob|url=https://archive.org/details/michaeljacksonma00jone|url-access=registration|quote=sold over 1 million copies.

A third album, ''[[Fire It Up (Rick James album)|Fire It Up]]'', was released in late 1979 going [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|gold]]. Around that same period, James launched his first headlining tour, the Fire It Up Tour, and agreed to invite the then-upcoming artist, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], as well as singer [[Teena Marie]], as his opening act.<ref name=\"glowreview\" /> James had produced Marie's successful Motown debut album, ''[[Wild and Peaceful (Teena Marie album)|Wild and Peaceful]]'' and was featured on the hit duet, \"I'm a Sucker (For Your Love)\". James was credited with naming Marie, \"Lady Tee\", on the song, a nickname that stuck with Marie for the rest of her career. The Fire It Up tour led to James developing a bitter rivalry with Prince, after he accused the musician of ripping off his act.<ref name=\"glowreview\" />\n\n{{listen\n| Type           = single\n| filename       = Rick James - Super Freak excerpt.ogg\n| format         = [[Ogg]]\n| title          = \"Super Freak\"}}\n\nFollowing the end of the tour in 1980, James released the ballads-heavy ''[[Garden of Love (album)|Garden of Love]]'', which became his fourth gold record. In 1981, James recorded his best-selling album to date, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which like his previous four albums, was a [[concept album]]. ''Street Songs'' featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and [[new wave music|new wave]], as well as James's brand of crossover funk, enabling James's own style of \"punk funk\". The album featured hit singles such as \"[[Ghetto Life (song)|Ghetto Life]]\", the Teena Marie duet \"Fire and Desire\", \"[[Give It to Me Baby]]\", and his biggest crossover hit to date, \"[[Super Freak]]\", which peaked at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and sold over 1 million copies. ''Street Songs'' peaked at number one R&B and number three pop, and sold over 3 million copies alone in the United States.<ref name=\":4\" /> Following up that success, James released two more gold albums, 1982's ''[[Throwin' Down]]'' and 1983's ''[[Cold Blooded (Rick James album)|Cold Blooded]]''.\n\nDuring this period, envious of Prince's success as producer of other acts including [[The Time (band)|The Time]] and [[Vanity 6]], James launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the [[Mary Jane Girls]], featuring his former background singer Joanne \"JoJo\" McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, \"[[All Night Long (Mary Jane Girls song)|All Night Long]]\", \"Candy Man\", and \"[[In My House]]\". In 1982, James produced the Temptations' Top 10 R&B hit, \"[[Standing On The Top (song)|Standing On The Top]]\". In 1983, James recorded the hit duet, \"Ebony Eyes\", with singer [[Smokey Robinson]], as well as a ballad \"Tell Me What You Want\" with an introduction by Billy Dee Williams. In 1985, James produced another hit for entertainer [[Eddie Murphy]] with the song \"[[Party All the Time]]\". That same year he appeared on an episode of ''[[The A-Team]]'' with [[Isaac Hayes]]. After the release of his ninth solo album, ''[[The Flag (album)|The Flag]]'', in 1986, James signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which released the album ''[[Wonderful (Rick James album)|Wonderful]]'' in 1988, featuring the hit, \"Loosey's Rap\".\n\nJames's controversial and provocative image became troublesome sometimes. Famous for promoting the use of [[marijuana]] live in concerts during a time that simple possession could lead to a long term prison sentence, James was often threatened by cops in various cities that he would be arrested if he smoked marijuana on stage during performances of songs such as \"Fire It Up\" and \"Mary Jane\". According to Kerry Gordy, most Motown executives erroneously thought the latter song was a \"simple cute love song to a girl\" not knowing the song was about marijuana.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nJames' overtly sexual bravado made it tough for him to be a bigger mainstream act. After the debut of the fledgling music video network [[MTV]] in August of 1981, James tried to present the music video to \"Super Freak\" to the label, only for the channel to turn the video down. James accused the network of racism.{{sfn|Denisof|1988|pp=69\u201371}} MTV denied this, stating the real reason \"Super Freak\" was turned down by MTV was because they felt James' video was too vulgar for the channel. When younger artists such as Prince and [[Michael Jackson]] found fame on the channel, James accused the two singers of being \"tokens\" in a 1983 interview, demanding that any black artist that has a video aired on MTV take their video off the channel in protest. James' rant was cosigned by [[David Bowie]], who argued with an MTV veejay about the lack of black artists being featured on the channel despite the successes of Jackson and Prince.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nWhen MTV and [[BET]] both avoided playing the video for \"Loosey's Rap\" because of its graphic sexual content, James considered the networks hypocritical in light of them still playing provocative videos by artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Decline ===\nIn 1989, James's 11th album, ''[[Kickin' (Rick James album)|Kickin'<nowiki/>]]'', was released only in the UK. By 1990, he had lost his deal with Warner Bros. and James began struggling with personal and legal troubles. That year [[MC Hammer]] released his hit [[signature song]], \"[[U Can't Touch This]]\", which sampled the prominent opening riff from \"[[Super Freak]].\" James and his co-writer on \"[[Super Freak]],\" Alonzo Miller, successfully sued Hammer for shared songwriting credit and all three consequently received a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1991.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=August 20, 1990|title=M.C.

That same year, he discussed his life and career in interviews for the [[VH1]] musical documentary series, ''[[Behind the Music]]'', which aired in early 1998.

{"title_page": "Curveball", "text_new": "{{other uses|Curveball (disambiguation)}}\n[[Image:12-6 Curveball.gif|thumb|200px|An animated diagram of a [[12\u20136 curveball]]]]\nIn [[baseball]] and [[softball]], the '''curveball''' is a type of [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] thrown with a characteristic grip and hand movement that imparts forward spin to the [[baseball (object)|ball]], causing it to dive as it approaches the plate. Varieties of curveball include the [[12\u20136 curveball]] and the [[knuckle curve]]. Its close relatives are the [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] and the [[slurve]]. The \"curve\" of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher.\n\nThe expression \"to throw a curveball\" essentially translates to introducing a significant deviation to a preceding concept.\n\n==Grip and action==\nThe curveball is gripped much like a cup or drinking glass is held. The pitcher places the middle finger on and parallel to one of the long seams, and the thumb just behind the seam on the opposite side of the ball such that if looking from the top down, the hand should form a \"C shape\" with the horseshoe pointing in towards the palm following the contour of the thumb. The index finger is placed alongside the middle finger, and the other two extraneous fingers are folded in towards the palm with the knuckle of the ring finger touching the leather. Occasionally some pitchers will flare out these two fingers straight and away from the ball to keep them clear of the throwing motion. The curveball and slider share nearly identical grips and throwing motion.\n\nThe delivery of a curveball is entirely different from that of most other pitches. The pitcher at the top of the throwing arc will snap the arm and wrist in a downward motion. The ball first leaves contact with the thumb and tumbles over the index finger thus imparting the forward or \"top-spin\" characteristic of a curveball. The result is the exact opposite pitch of the [[four-seam fastball]]'s backspin, but with all four seams rotating in the direction of the flight path with forward-spin, with the [[axis of rotation]] perpendicular to the intended flight path much like a [[reel-type mower]] or a [[bowling ball]].\n[[File:Curve 1.JPG|thumb|Grip of a curveball]]\nThe amount of break on the ball depends on how hard the pitcher can snap the throw off, or how much forward spin can be put on the ball. The harder the snap, the more the pitch will break. Curveballs primarily break downwards, but can also break toward the pitcher's off hand to varying degrees. Unlike the fastball, the apex of the ball's flight path arc does not necessarily need to occur at the pitcher's release point, and often peaks shortly afterwards. Curveballs are thrown with considerably less velocity than fastballs, because of both the unnatural delivery of the ball and the general rule that pitches thrown with less velocity will break more.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf |title=Pitching 101 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090324011336/http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-24 |url-status=dead |format=pdf}}</ref>  A typical curveball in the major collegiate level and above will average between 65 and 80&nbsp;mph, with the average [[MLB]] curve at 77&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efastball.com/baseball/pitching/grips/curve-ball-grip/ |title=Curve Ball Grip |publisher=Efastball.com |date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2013-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724073952/http://www.efastball.com/baseball/pitching/grips/curve-ball-grip/ |archive-date=2017-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrom a hitter's perspective, the curveball will start in one location (usually high or at the top of the strike zone) and then dive rapidly as it approaches the plate. The most effective curveballs will start breaking at the apex of the arc of the ball flight, and continue to break more and more rapidly as they approach and cross through the strike zone. A curveball that a pitcher fails to put enough spin on will not break much and is colloquially called a \"hanging curve\". Hanging curves are usually disastrous for a pitcher because the low velocity, non-breaking pitch arrives high in the zone where hitters can wait on it and drive it for power.\n[[File:Curveball topspin.svg|thumb|Diagram of the movement of a thrown curveball]]\nThe curveball is a popular and effective pitch in professional baseball, but it is not particularly widespread in leagues with players younger than college level. This is with regard for the safety of the pitcher \u2013 not because of its difficulty \u2013 though the pitch is widely considered difficult to learn as it requires some degree of mastery and the ability to pinpoint the thrown ball's location. There is generally a greater chance of throwing [[wild pitch]]es when throwing the curveball.\n\nWhen thrown correctly, it could have a break from seven to as much as 20&nbsp;inches in comparison to the same pitcher's fastball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/holy-mother-of-strasburg-with-pitch-f-x/ |title=Holy mother of Strasburg (with Pitch f/x!) |publisher=Hardballtimes.com |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nDue to the unnatural motion required to throw it, the curveball is considered a more advanced pitch and poses inherent risk of injury to a pitcher's elbow and shoulder. There has been a controversy, as reported in the ''New York Times'', March 12, 2012, about whether curveballs alone are responsible for injuries in young pitchers or whether it is the number of pitches thrown that are the predisposing factor.<ref name=nyt>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/sports/baseball/debate-grows-over-how-to-protect-young-pitching-arms.html|title=Young Arms and Curveballs: A Scientific Twist|author=Bill Pennington|work=The New York Times|date=2012-03-11}}</ref> In theory, allowing time for the [[cartilage]] and [[tendon]]s of the arm to fully develop would protect against injuries. While acquisition of proper form might be protective, Dr. James Andrews is quoted in the article as stating that in many children, insufficient neuromuscular control, lack of proper mechanics, and fatigue make maintenance of proper form unlikely.\n\nThe parts of the arm most commonly injured by the curveball are the [[ligament]]s in the elbow, the [[biceps]], and the forearm muscles.<ref name=thurston>{{Cite book|url=http://www.baseball-articles.com/teachcurve.html|title=Age to Teach the Curve Ball and How to Teach It|author=Bill Thurston|year=2008|access-date=2009-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214063238/http://baseball-articles.com/teachcurve.html|archive-date=2009-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> Major elbow injury requires repair through elbow ligament reconstruction, or [[Tommy John surgery]].\n\n==The \"12\u20136 curveball\" vs. the \"Roundhouse Curveball\" vs. the \"Slurve\"==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nCurveballs have a variety of trajectories and breaks among pitchers. This chiefly has to do with the arm slot and release point of a given pitcher, which is in turn governed by how comfortable the pitcher is throwing the overhand curveball.\n\nPitchers who can throw a curveball completely overhanded with the arm slot more or less vertical will have a curveball that will break straight downwards. This is called a [[12\u20136 curveball]] as the break of the pitch is on a straight path downwards like the hands of a clock at 12 and 6. The [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] of a 12\u20136 curve is parallel with the level ground and perpendicular to its flight path.\n\nPitchers throwing their curveballs with the arm slot at an angle will throw a curveball that breaks down and toward the pitcher's off-hand. In the most extreme cases, the curve will break very wide laterally. Because the slider and the curveball share nearly the same grip and have the same unique throwing motions, this curveball breaks much like a slider, and is colloquially termed a \"[[slurve]].\" The axis of rotation on a slurve will still be more or less perpendicular to the flight path of the ball; the latter however will not be parallel to the ground. With some pitchers, the difference between curveball and other pitches such as slider and slurve may be difficult to detect or even describe. A less common term for this type of curveball is a 1\u20137 (outdrop,outcurve, dropping roundhouse) or 2\u20138 (sweeping roundhouse curveball). \n\nA curveball spinning on a vertical axis completely perpendicular to its flight path and thus with complete side spin that is either 3-9 for a right handed pitcher or 9-3 for a left handed pitcher is called a sweeping curveball, flat curveball, or frisbee curveball. The flat curveball will still drop because of gravity, but due to the lack of top spin the drop is only a small amount compared to the 12-6, 1-7/11-5, or 2-8/10-4 curveballs. Most often this side spin happens due to a pitcher having an arm angle that is either side arm or at a very low 3/4 arm angle. However, sometimes complete side spin happens for a pitcher who has a higher arm slot due to the person throwing the pitch with a twisting motion causing the fingers to move around the side of the ball instead of over the top of the ball. Using this twisting motion around the ball is said to cause injury to the arm near the elbow. A slider's spin axis is almost parallel to the ball's flight path similar to a football or bullet, but tilted slightly upwards pointing to 12 O'clock. When a slider's spin axis points to 1 O'clock or 2 O'clock, then the pitch becomes a slurve. This slurve tends to happen when a pitcher uses too much force on the curveball and less finesse. This happens because the pitcher may lazily pronate slightly at the release point instead of following through with complete supination at the end of the throw for the curve. At other times the slurve will happen due to the pitcher supinating a little too much at the release point when throwing a slider, which may be called a slurvy slider. A slurvy slider with the same velocity of a power slider (5-8mph slower than a fastball) may impart a greater break.\n\n==Physics==\nGenerally the [[Magnus effect]] describes the laws of physics that make a curveball curve. A fastball travels through the air with backspin, which creates a higher pressure zone in the air ahead of and under the baseball. The baseball's raised seams augment the ball's ability to develop a [[boundary layer]] and therefore a greater differential of pressure between the upper and lower zones. The effect of [[gravity]] is partially counteracted as the ball rides on and into increased pressure. Thus the fastball falls less than a ball thrown without spin (neglecting [[knuckleball]] effects) during the 60&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches it travels to home plate.\n\nOn the other hand, a curveball, thrown with [[topspin]], creates a higher pressure zone on top of the ball, which deflects the ball downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby giving the ball an exaggerated drop in flight.\n\n==Real or illusion?==\nThere was once a debate on whether a curveball actually curves or is an [[optical illusion]]. In 1949, Ralph B. Lightfoot, an aeronautical engineer at [[Sikorsky Aircraft]], used wind tunnel tests to prove that a curveball curves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phschool.com/science/science_news/articles/pitching_science.html |title=Pitching Science \u2013 Engineers who track baseballs catch insights into the game |publisher=Phschool.com |date=2001-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref> On whether a curveball is caused by an illusion, [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Dizzy Dean]] has been quoted in a number of variations on this basic premise: \"Stand behind a tree 60&nbsp;feet away, and I will whomp you with an optical illusion!\"\n\nHowever, optical illusion caused by the ball's spinning may play an important part in what makes curveballs difficult to hit. The curveball's trajectory is smooth, however the batter perceives a sudden, dramatic change in the ball's direction. When an object that is spinning and moving through space is viewed directly, the overall motion is interpreted correctly by the brain. However, as it enters the peripheral vision, the internal spinning motion distorts how the overall motion is perceived. A curveball's trajectory begins in the center of the batter's vision, but overlaps with peripheral vision as it approaches the plate, which may explain the suddenness of the break perceived by the batter.<ref>{{cite web |author=2009finalist |url=http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2009/the-break-of-the-curveball/ |title=2009 Vision Sciences Meeting: Curveball Demo Wins Illusion Contest |publisher=Illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com |date=2009-05-10 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027064948/http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2009/the-break-of-the-curveball/ |archivedate=2010-10-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227114.300-revealed-why-curve-balls-are-so-hard-to-hit.html |title=Revealed: Why curveballs are so hard to hit |publisher=New Scientist |date=2009-06-07 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=<!--start post navigation--> Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2010/10/curveball-illusion/ |title=Wired |publisher=Wired |date= 2010-10-19|accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/breaking_curveball_too_good_to_be_true.html |title=Breaking Curveball Too Good to Be True \u2013 USC News |publisher=Uscnews.usc.edu |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023013800/http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/breaking_curveball_too_good_to_be_true.html |archivedate=2010-10-23 }}</ref> A peer-reviewed article on this hypothesis was published in 2010.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Transitions between Central and Peripheral Vision Create Spatial/Temporal Distortions: A Hypothesis Concerning the Perceived Break of the Curveball |journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e13296 |date=2010-10-13 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013296|pmid=20967247 |pmc=2954145 |last1 = Shapiro|first1 = Arthur|last2=Lu |first2=Zhong-Lin |last3=Huang |first3=Chang-Bing |last4=Knight |first4=Emily |last5=Ennis |first5=Robert }}</ref>\n\n==Nicknames==\nPopular nicknames for the curveball include \"the bender\" and \"the hook\" (both describing the trajectory of the pitch), \"Uncle Charlie\", \"Lord Charles\", \"the yellow hammer\", and \"the yakker\".

Varieties of curveball include the [[12-6 curveball]] and the [[knuckle curve]]. Its close relatives are the [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] and the [[slurve]]. The \"curve\" of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher.\n\nThe expression \"to throw a curveball\" essentially translates to introducing a significant deviation to a preceding concept.\n\n==Grip and action==\nThe curveball is gripped much like a cup or drinking glass is held. The pitcher places the middle finger on and parallel to one of the long seams, and the thumb just behind the seam on the opposite side of the ball such that if looking from the top down, the hand should form a \"C shape\" with the horseshoe pointing in towards the palm following the contour of the thumb. The index finger is placed alongside the middle finger, and the other two extraneous fingers are folded in towards the palm with the knuckle of the ring finger touching the leather. Occasionally some pitchers will flare out these two fingers straight and away from the ball to keep them clear of the throwing motion. The curveball and slider share nearly identical grips and throwing motion.\n\nThe delivery of a curveball is entirely different from that of most other pitches. The pitcher at the top of the throwing arc will snap the arm and wrist in a downward motion. The ball first leaves contact with the thumb and tumbles over the index finger thus imparting the forward or \"top-spin\" characteristic of a curveball. The result is the exact opposite pitch of the [[four-seam fastball]]'s backspin, but with all four seams rotating in the direction of the flight path with forward-spin, with the [[axis of rotation]] perpendicular to the intended flight path much like a [[reel-type mower]] or a [[bowling ball]].\n[[File:Curve 1.JPG|thumb|Grip of a curveball]]\nThe amount of break on the ball depends on how hard the pitcher can snap the throw off, or how much forward spin can be put on the ball. The harder the snap, the more the pitch will break. Curveballs primarily break downwards, but can also break toward the pitcher's off hand to varying degrees. Unlike the fastball, the apex of the ball's flight path arc does not necessarily need to occur at the pitcher's release point, and often peaks shortly afterwards. Curveballs are thrown with considerably less velocity than fastballs, because of both the unnatural delivery of the ball and the general rule that pitches thrown with less velocity will break more.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf |title=Pitching 101 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090324011336/http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/pdf/pitchingpage.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-24 |url-status=dead |format=pdf}}</ref>  A typical curveball in the major collegiate level and above will average between 65 and 80&nbsp;mph, with the average [[MLB]] curve at 77&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efastball.com/baseball/pitching/grips/curve-ball-grip/ |title=Curve Ball Grip |publisher=Efastball.com |date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2013-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724073952/http://www.efastball.com/baseball/pitching/grips/curve-ball-grip/ |archive-date=2017-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrom a hitter's perspective, the curveball will start in one location (usually high or at the top of the strike zone) and then dive rapidly as it approaches the plate. The most effective curveballs will start breaking at the apex of the arc of the ball flight, and continue to break more and more rapidly as they approach and cross through the strike zone. A curveball that a pitcher fails to put enough spin on will not break much and is colloquially called a \"hanging curve\". Hanging curves are usually disastrous for a pitcher because the low velocity, non-breaking pitch arrives high in the zone where hitters can wait on it and drive it for power.\n[[File:Curveball topspin.svg|thumb|Diagram of the movement of a thrown curveball]]\nThe curveball is a popular and effective pitch in professional baseball, but it is not particularly widespread in leagues with players younger than college level. This is with regard for the safety of the pitcher \u2013 not because of its difficulty \u2013 though the pitch is widely considered difficult to learn as it requires some degree of mastery and the ability to pinpoint the thrown ball's location. There is generally a greater chance of throwing [[wild pitch]]es when throwing the curveball.\n\nWhen thrown correctly, it could have a break from seven to as much as 20&nbsp;inches in comparison to the same pitcher's fastball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/blog_article/holy-mother-of-strasburg-with-pitch-f-x/ |title=Holy mother of Strasburg (with Pitch f/x!) |publisher=Hardballtimes.com |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nDue to the unnatural motion required to throw it, the curveball is considered a more advanced pitch and poses inherent risk of injury to a pitcher's elbow and shoulder. There has been a controversy, as reported in the ''New York Times'', March 12, 2012, about whether curveballs alone are responsible for injuries in young pitchers or whether it is the number of pitches thrown that are the predisposing factor.<ref name=nyt>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/sports/baseball/debate-grows-over-how-to-protect-young-pitching-arms.html|title=Young Arms and Curveballs: A Scientific Twist|author=Bill Pennington|work=The New York Times|date=2012-03-11}}</ref> In theory, allowing time for the [[cartilage]] and [[tendon]]s of the arm to fully develop would protect against injuries. While acquisition of proper form might be protective, Dr. James Andrews is quoted in the article as stating that in many children, insufficient neuromuscular control, lack of proper mechanics, and fatigue make maintenance of proper form unlikely.\n\nThe parts of the arm most commonly injured by the curveball are the [[ligament]]s in the elbow, the [[biceps]], and the forearm muscles.<ref name=thurston>{{Cite book|url=http://www.baseball-articles.com/teachcurve.html|title=Age to Teach the Curve Ball and How to Teach It|author=Bill Thurston|year=2008|access-date=2009-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214063238/http://baseball-articles.com/teachcurve.html|archive-date=2009-02-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> Major elbow injury requires repair through elbow ligament reconstruction, or [[Tommy John surgery]].\n\n==The \"12\u20136 curveball\" vs. the \"Roundhouse Curveball\" vs. the \"Slurve\"==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nCurveballs have a variety of trajectories and breaks among pitchers. This chiefly has to do with the arm slot and release point of a given pitcher, which is in turn governed by how comfortable the pitcher is throwing the overhand curveball.\n\nPitchers who can throw a curveball completely overhanded with the arm slot more or less vertical will have a curveball that will break straight downwards. This is called a [[12\u20136 curveball]] as the break of the pitch is on a straight path downwards like the hands of a clock at 12 and 6. The [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] of a 12\u20136 curve is parallel with the level ground and perpendicular to its flight path.\n\nPitchers throwing their curveballs with the arm slot at an angle will throw a curveball that breaks down and toward the pitcher's off-hand. In the most extreme cases, the curve will break very wide laterally. Because the slider and the curveball share nearly the same grip and have the same unique throwing motions, this curveball breaks much like a slider, and is colloquially termed a \"[[slurve]].\" The axis of rotation on a slurve will still be more or less perpendicular to the flight path of the ball; the latter however will not be parallel to the ground. With some pitchers, the difference between curveball and other pitches such as slider and slurve may be difficult to detect or even describe. A less common term for this type of curveball is a 1\u20137 (outdrop,outcurve, dropping roundhouse) or 2\u20138 (sweeping roundhouse curveball). \n\nA curveball spinning on a vertical axis completely perpendicular to its flight path and thus with complete side spin that is either 3-9 for a right handed pitcher or 9-3 for a left handed pitcher is called a sweeping curveball, flat curveball, or frisbee curveball. The flat curveball will still drop because of gravity, but due to the lack of top spin the drop is only a small amount compared to the 12-6, 1-7/11-5, or 2-8/10-4 curveballs. Most often this side spin happens due to a pitcher having an arm angle that is either side arm or at a very low 3/4 arm angle. However, sometimes complete side spin happens for a pitcher who has a higher arm slot due to the person throwing the pitch with a twisting motion causing the fingers to move around the side of the ball instead of over the top of the ball. Using this twisting motion around the ball is said to cause injury to the arm near the elbow. A slider's spin axis is almost parallel to the ball's flight path similar to a football or bullet, but tilted slightly upwards pointing to 12 O'clock. When a slider's spin axis points to 1 O'clock or 2 O'clock, then the pitch becomes a slurve. This slurve tends to happen when a pitcher uses too much force on the curveball and less finesse. This happens because the pitcher may lazily pronate slightly at the release point instead of following through with complete supination at the end of the throw for the curve. At other times the slurve will happen due to the pitcher supinating a little too much at the release point when throwing a slider, which may be called a slurvy slider. A slurvy slider with the same velocity of a power slider (5-8mph slower than a fastball) may impart a greater break.\n\n==Physics==\nGenerally the [[Magnus effect]] describes the laws of physics that make a curveball curve. A fastball travels through the air with backspin, which creates a higher pressure zone in the air ahead of and under the baseball. The baseball's raised seams augment the ball's ability to develop a [[boundary layer]] and therefore a greater differential of pressure between the upper and lower zones. The effect of [[gravity]] is partially counteracted as the ball rides on and into increased pressure. Thus the fastball falls less than a ball thrown without spin (neglecting [[knuckleball]] effects) during the 60&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches it travels to home plate.\n\nOn the other hand, a curveball, thrown with [[topspin]], creates a higher pressure zone on top of the ball, which deflects the ball downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby giving the ball an exaggerated drop in flight.\n\n==Real or illusion?==\nThere was once a debate on whether a curveball actually curves or is an [[optical illusion]]. In 1949, Ralph B. Lightfoot, an aeronautical engineer at [[Sikorsky Aircraft]], used wind tunnel tests to prove that a curveball curves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phschool.com/science/science_news/articles/pitching_science.html |title=Pitching Science \u2013 Engineers who track baseballs catch insights into the game |publisher=Phschool.com |date=2001-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref> On whether a curveball is caused by an illusion, [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Dizzy Dean]] has been quoted in a number of variations on this basic premise: \"Stand behind a tree 60&nbsp;feet away, and I will whomp you with an optical illusion!\"\n\nHowever, optical illusion caused by the ball's spinning may play an important part in what makes curveballs difficult to hit. The curveball's trajectory is smooth, however the batter perceives a sudden, dramatic change in the ball's direction. When an object that is spinning and moving through space is viewed directly, the overall motion is interpreted correctly by the brain. However, as it enters the peripheral vision, the internal spinning motion distorts how the overall motion is perceived. A curveball's trajectory begins in the center of the batter's vision, but overlaps with peripheral vision as it approaches the plate, which may explain the suddenness of the break perceived by the batter.<ref>{{cite web |author=2009finalist |url=http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2009/the-break-of-the-curveball/ |title=2009 Vision Sciences Meeting: Curveball Demo Wins Illusion Contest |publisher=Illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com |date=2009-05-10 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027064948/http://illusioncontest.neuralcorrelate.com/2009/the-break-of-the-curveball/ |archivedate=2010-10-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227114.300-revealed-why-curve-balls-are-so-hard-to-hit.html |title=Revealed: Why curveballs are so hard to hit |publisher=New Scientist |date=2009-06-07 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=<!--start post navigation--> Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2010/10/curveball-illusion/ |title=Wired |publisher=Wired |date= 2010-10-19|accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/breaking_curveball_too_good_to_be_true.html |title=Breaking Curveball Too Good to Be True \u2013 USC News |publisher=Uscnews.usc.edu |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023013800/http://uscnews.usc.edu/science_technology/breaking_curveball_too_good_to_be_true.html |archivedate=2010-10-23 }}</ref> A peer-reviewed article on this hypothesis was published in 2010.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Transitions between Central and Peripheral Vision Create Spatial/Temporal Distortions: A Hypothesis Concerning the Perceived Break of the Curveball |journal=PLOS ONE|volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e13296 |date=2010-10-13 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013296|pmid=20967247 |pmc=2954145 |last1 = Shapiro|first1 = Arthur|last2=Lu |first2=Zhong-Lin |last3=Huang |first3=Chang-Bing |last4=Knight |first4=Emily |last5=Ennis |first5=Robert }}</ref>\n\n==Nicknames==\nPopular nicknames for the curveball include \"the bender\" and \"the hook\" (both describing the trajectory of the pitch), \"Uncle Charlie\", \"Lord Charles\", \"the yellow hammer\", and \"the yakker\".

The primary members of the band are [[Spencer Seim]] on [[electric guitar]] and [[Zach Hill]] on [[drum kit|drums]]. In 2005, the band expanded their live band by adding [[Dan Elkan]] on vocals, rhythm guitar, sampler and synthesizer and Jonathan Hischke on synth bass guitar for their Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard tour. In 2006 they reformed as a five-piece line-up including Seim, Hill, Carson McWhirter (of [[The Advantage]]), Aaron Ross & Josh Hill. In 2009, the band was reduced back to core members Hill and Seim.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years===\nAs high school students [[Spencer Seim]] and [[Zach Hill]] were both members of the [[Northern California]] band Legs on Earth along with Josh Hill on guitar and Julian Imsdahl on bass and vocals. The band achieved some moderate local success, becoming renowned for their wild live shows, young age, and [[Primus (band)|Primus]]-esque sound. The band sounded similar to Primus, especially the vocals and bass but Zach Hill described it in an interview as pop music but like [[Devo]] and [[Talking Heads]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokilli.com/indie/hellaInt.htm |title=Sacramento Underground Music |publisher=Nokilli.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> They released one CD in 2001 called ''Lasers & Saviors'' on local record label Para-Sight Records, now out of print. In 2001 they went on hiatus and later broke up. Imsdahl is currently in the band Grandstream (formerly known as Little California), and was previously in the band Eraserhead. Hill and Seim decided they wanted to continue playing together and pursue a less mainstream sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hella-mn0000672835/biography|title=Hella - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref> According to Hill, they didn't always intend to remain a duo, though: \"[We] had intentions to start a band that was like\u2026 kinda like what we were doing with just the two of us, but with more people.

Released on June 17 of that year, Hella's ''Bitches Ain't Shit But Good People'' EP (originally a vinyl only release) featured many firsts for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11756-bitches-aint-shit-but-good-people-ep-total-bugs-bunny-on-wild-bass-ep/|title=Hella: Bitches Ain't Shit But Good People EP / Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass EP Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref> An earlier recorded (''Leather Diamond'') version of a song from their first LP, \"Republic of Rough And Ready\", became their first widely released song to feature vocals (provided by friend of the band Dan Elkan). A version of \"1-800-Ghost-Dance\" with vocals by Elkan was available as a downloadable mp3 on the band's website in late 2002. The ''Bitches'' EP also found Hella using [[bass guitar]], [[synthesizer]], and [[drum machine]] for the first time. ''Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass'', also an EP, was released on August 26 and featured the use of synth, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], and drum machine and an apparent influence from 8-bit [[video game music]], first hinted at on the opening track of ''Hold Your Horse Is'', \"The D. Elkan\". Hella rounded out the year with a split live double CD with San Francisco, California-based band [[Dilute (band)|Dilute]].\n\nHella released their second full-length LP in 2004, ''The Devil Isn't Red''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-devil-isnt-red-mw0000322849|title=The Devil Isn't Red Review|work=Allmusic|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> Other releases for the year included a split 7\" (with [[Four Tet]]) and a [[Special edition|limited edition]], Japan-only release of the three-song ''Acoustics'' EP.\n\nFor their 2005 release, Hella again experimented with their sound in the studio.

The primary members of the band are [[Spencer Seim]] on [[electric guitar]] and [[Zach Hill]] on [[drum kit|drums]]. In 2005, the band expanded their live band by adding [[Dan Elkan]] on vocals, rhythm guitar, sampler and synthesizer and Jonathan Hischke on synth bass guitar for their Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard tour. In 2006 they reformed as a five-piece line-up including Seim, Hill, Carson McWhirter (of [[The Advantage]]), Aaron Ross & Josh Hill. In 2009, the band was reduced back to core members Hill and Seim.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years===\nAs high school students [[Spencer Seim]] and [[Zach Hill]] were both members of the [[Northern California]] band Legs on Earth along with Josh Hill on guitar and Julian Imsdahl on bass and vocals. The band achieved some moderate local success, becoming renowned for their wild live shows, young age, and [[Primus (band)|Primus]]-esque sound. The band sounded similar to Primus, especially the vocals and bass but Zach Hill described it in an interview as pop music but like [[Devo]] and [[Talking Heads]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokilli.com/indie/hellaInt.htm |title=Sacramento Underground Music |publisher=Nokilli.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> They released one CD in 2001 called ''Lasers & Saviors'' on local record label Para-Sight Records, now out of print. In 2001 they went on hiatus and later broke up. Imsdahl is currently in the band Grandstream (formerly known as Little California), and was previously in the band Eraserhead. Hill and Seim decided they wanted to continue playing together and pursue a less mainstream sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hella-mn0000672835/biography|title=Hella - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref> According to Hill, they didn't always intend to remain a duo, though: \"[We] had intentions to start a band that was like\u2026 kinda like what we were doing with just the two of us, but with more people.

''Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass'', also an EP, was released on August 26 and featured the use of synth, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], and drum machine and an apparent influence from 8-bit [[video game music]], first hinted at on the opening track of ''Hold Your Horse Is'', \"The D.

Hill's best known project outside of Hella now is perhaps experimental hip hop outfit [[Death Grips]], who have gone on to achieve a cult following of their own right and widespread critical acclaim.\n\nBoth Hill and Hischke are members of [[El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez]] with [[Juan Alderete]], [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] and [[Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez]], the first of three records produced by the group is ''[[Cryptomnesia (album)|Cryptomnesia]]'', which was released on May 5, 2009.\n\nIn 2008, Hischke formed the band [[Dot Hacker]] along with [[Josh Klinghoffer]].\n\nThe song \"Biblical Violence\" is featured on episode 24 of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''Hold Your Horse Is'' (2002), [[5 Rue Christine]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/27014/Hella-Hold-Your-Horse-Is/|title=Hella - Hold Your Horse Is (album review ) - Sputnikmusic|website=www.sputnikmusic.com|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hold-your-horse-is-mw0000658303|title=Hold Your Horse Is - Hella - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n*''The Devil Isn't Red'' (2004), 5 Rue Christine <ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3961-the-devil-isnt-red/|title=The Devil Isn't Red Album Review|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n*''Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard'' (2005), [[Suicide Squeeze]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/hella/church-gone-wildchirpin-hard.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912214037/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/hella/church-gone-wildchirpin-hard.htm|url-status=dead|title=Hella - Church Gone Wild/Chirpin\u2019 Hard - Review - Stylus Magazine|date=12 September 2012|archivedate=12 September 2012|website=stylusmagazine.com|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n*''There's No 666 in Outer Space'' (2007), [[Ipecac Recordings]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicfrontiers.net/php/review-42.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070630200331/http://www.sonicfrontiers.net/php/review-42.html|url-status=dead|title=Hella: There's No 666 In Outer Space: Album Review - SonicFrontiers.n\u2026|date=30 June 2007|archivedate=30 June 2007|website=sonicfrontiers.net|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n*''Tripper'' (2011), [[Sargent House]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2419142|title=Hella - Tripper - Album Review - AbsolutePunk.net|date=6 September 2011|website=archive.org|accessdate=2 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716145550/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2419142|archivedate=16 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noripcord.com/reviews/music/hella/tripper|title=Tripper|website=No Ripcord|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===EPs===\n*''Leather Diamond'' (2001)\n*''Bitches Ain't Shit but Good People'' (2003), Suicide Squeeze <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-aint-shit-but-good-people-ep-mw0000029500|title=Bitches Ain't Shit But Good People [EP] - Hella - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>\n*''Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass'' (2003), [[Narnack Records]]\n*''Concentration Face/Homeboy'' (2005), 5 Rue Christine\n*''Acoustics'' (2006), Toad Records/5 Rue Christine\n*''Santa's Little Hella'' (2013), [[Joyful Noise Recordings|Joyful Noise]]\n\n===Singles===\n*''Falam Dynasty'' (2002), 5 Rue Christine\n\n===Split releases===\n*live split with [[Dilute (band)|Dilute]] (2003) [[Sick Room Records, LTD]]\n*split with [[Four Tet]] (2004), [[Ache Records]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ihrtn.com/2009/07/29/hella/ Band's biography / discography]\n* [http://www.ipecac.com/bio.php?id=50 Hella on Ipecac Recordings]\n* [http://www.5rc.com/ 5 Rue Christine]\n* [https://archive.org/details/Hella Hella live recordings] at the [[Internet Archive]]\n* [https://www.myspace.com/holysmokesthesquire Zach Hill tribute site]\n\n{{Hella}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hella}}\n[[Category:American noise rock music groups]]\n[[Category:Kill Rock Stars]]\n[[Category:Math rock groups]]\n[[Category:Rock music duos]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2001]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Sacramento, California]]\n[[Category:American experimental rock groups]]\n[[Category:Suicide Squeeze Records artists]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove circular link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hella_(band)"}
