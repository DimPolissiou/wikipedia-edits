There was a core of NCSY from two early founded regions Midwest Region (founded 1951) and Southern Region (founded in 1952 by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Rosenberg and Mr. Abe Rabhan of B'nai B'rith Jacob synagogue in Savannah, Georgia).\nIn 1954, Harold and Enid Boxer donated the money to create a national organization from the already-existing Southern and Midwest Regions.<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |title=About us |publisher=Cbaj-albany.org |accessdate=2012-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111538/http://www.cbaj-albany.org/ncsy/members.htm |archivedate=2012-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, NCSY hired Rabbi [[Pinchas Stolper]] as the first National Director.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEgcAAAAMAAJ |title=Saul Bernstein, '&#39;The Renaissance of the Torah Jew'&#39; (KTAV Publishing, 1985), pp. 274, 339 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s there was an emphasis on NCSY Publications with many volumes written by Pinchas Stolper and then later the Aryeh Kaplan Series.

It was originally known as \"NCSY Goes to Yeshiva,\" and later changed its name to \"Camp NCSY Sports\".<ref name=\"cbaj-albany.org\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the Israel Summer Institute for Jewish teens was founded. Rabbi Stolper assisted NCSY in expanding internationally into Canada, Israel, Australia, Chile, and Ukraine.\n\nBy 2015, NCSY Summer Programs included The Anne Samson Jerusalem (TJJ), NCSY Kollel, NCSY Michlelet, NCSY GIVE (Girls Israel Volunteer Experience), NCSY JOLT (Jewish Overseas Leadership Training), NCSY BILT (Boys Israel Leadership Training), and other summer programs.

They are [[New England]], Upper New York, [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]], Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South [[Florida]], Greater Midwest, Southwest, [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Northwest, and [[Canada]]. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in [[Israel]] and now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like [[New Jersey]], counties may have several chapters.\n\nMany chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions.\n\nNCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \"junior\" and \"senior\"; these generally encompass 5th\u20138th grades and 9th\u201312th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each.\n\n==Programming==\nNCSY's original model was to create the regional [[Shabbaton]], a weekend-long social and educational [[Shabbat]] experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar.\n\nCurrently, while on [[Shabbaton]]s kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \"circle guy\" where they sing songs and do \"funny\" routines.  They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.\n\n== NCSY Summer ==\nNCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut.\n\nBoys Trips:\n\n* Camp Sports - \"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

The investigation began on July 12, 2000, he was indicted in March of that same year and surrendered to authorities and entered a plea of \"not-guilty\" on April 20, 2000. Lanner was convicted on one account of fondling a student on June 27 of 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lanner_baruch.html|title=Case of Rabbi Baruch Lanner (AKA: Bernard S.

It also sometimes tends to a charismatic quality.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5092/is_200008/ai_n18524887 The Dark Side of Outreach: Does NCSY value religious observance over family harmony?

A 54-page public report summarizing a much longer document of investigation, found the following.\n\n<blockquote>The report cited \"profound errors of judgment\" in the way OU leaders dealt with Lanner and also noted a larger problem of \"poor management practices\" in the OU, including a lack of accountability by professionals to volunteer leadership, lack of involvement by lay leaders in matters of governance, lack of financial controls and a \"total absence of any policies regarding basic ethical issues\" in both the OU and NCSY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=6318|title=News report 2001|date=|publisher=Jewishjournal.com|accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the Lanner scandal, NCSY conducted a thoroughgoing internal review and reformed its structures and running.

Rabbi Stolper assisted NCSY in expanding internationally into Canada, Israel, Australia, Chile, and Ukraine.\n\nBy 2015, NCSY Summer Programs included The Anne Samson Jerusalem (TJJ), NCSY Kollel, NCSY Michlelet, NCSY GIVE (Girls Israel Volunteer Experience), NCSY JOLT (Jewish Overseas Leadership Training), NCSY BILT (Boys Israel Leadership Training), and other summer programs.

They are [[New England]], Upper New York, [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Long Island]], [[New Jersey]], Atlantic Seaboard, Central East, Southern, South [[Florida]], Greater Midwest, Southwest, [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Northwest, and [[Canada]]. Additionally, NCSY runs programming branches in [[Israel]] and now [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Each Region is divided into chapters. A chapter is typically a city, or a group of surrounding towns. In heavily populated Jewish areas like [[New Jersey]], counties may have several chapters.\n\nMany chapters in NCSY appoint or elect a group of NCSYers to serve on a chapter board, who work with the advisors or city directors to assist with programming or outreach. Many regions do the same thing, and have a regional board, who do similar things for the region. The International Board consists of representatives from many different regions.\n\nNCSY's programming is divided into two age groups, \"junior\" and \"senior\"; these generally encompass 5th\u20138th grades and 9th\u201312th grades, respectively. Some programs span both age groups, but most programming is unique for each.\n\n==Programming==\nNCSY's original model was to create the regional [[Shabbaton]], a weekend-long social and educational [[Shabbat]] experience based on learning sessions, following in the model of Abraham Stern of Torah Leadership Seminar.\n\nCurrently, while on [[Shabbaton]]s kids are treated to skits, learning sessions and ebbing, where participants sit in a circle around the \"circle guy\" where they sing songs and do \"funny\" routines.  They are housed either in hotels, camps, or grouped with sponsor families who take them in for the weekend.\n\n== NCSY Summer ==\nNCSY Summer runs 18 different trips to Israel, Europe, and North America. The trips have fluctuated every year, with new programs released and other programs cut.\n\nBoys Trips:\n\n* Camp Sports - \"Camp Sports enables participants to hone their athletic skills while learning Torah with their friends and advisors in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.

It also sometimes tends to a charismatic quality.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5092/is_200008/ai_n18524887 The Dark Side of Outreach: Does NCSY value religious observance over family harmony?

A 54-page public report summarizing a much longer document of investigation, found the following.\n\n<blockquote>The report cited \"profound errors of judgment\" in the way OU leaders dealt with Lanner and also noted a larger problem of \"poor management practices\" in the OU, including a lack of accountability by professionals to volunteer leadership, lack of involvement by lay leaders in matters of governance, lack of financial controls and a \"total absence of any policies regarding basic ethical issues\" in both the OU and NCSY.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=6318|title=News report 2001|date=|publisher=Jewishjournal.com|accessdate=2012-07-04}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the Lanner scandal, NCSY conducted a thoroughgoing internal review and reformed its structures and running.

It was the only member of the genus ''[[Passerculus]]'' and is typically the only widely accepted member. Comparison of [[mtDNA]] [[NADH dehydrogenase]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]] 2 and 3 [[DNA sequence|sequence]]s indicates that the '''Ipswich sparrow''', formerly usually considered a valid species (as '''''Passerculus princeps'''''), is a well-marked [[subspecies]] of the Savannah sparrow, whereas the southwestern '''large-billed sparrow''' should be recognized as a distinct species (''Passerculus rostratus'').<ref name = zinketal2005/>\n\nThe common name comes from [[Savannah, Georgia]], where one of the first specimens of this bird was collected.\n\n==Distribution==\nThis [[passerine]] [[bird]] breeds in [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], northern, central and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastal United States, [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The Pacific and Mexican breeders are resident, but other populations are [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering from the southern United States across [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] to northern [[South America]]. It is a very rare vagrant to western [[Europe]].<ref name = byersetal1995/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThis species has a typically [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]-like dark-streaked brown back, and whitish underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking. It has whitish crown and [[supercilium]] stripes, sometimes with some yellow (more often near the [[beak]]). The cheeks are brown and the throat white. The [[flight feather]]s are blackish-brown with light brown or white border. The eyes are dark. The feet and legs are horn-colored, as is the lower part of the bill, with the upper part being dark grey.<ref name = byersetal1995 />\n\nThe Savannah sparrow is a very variable species, with numerous [[subspecies]], several of which have been split as separate species at various times. The different forms vary principally in the darkness of the plumage. The variation generally follows [[Gloger's rule]], with Alaskan and interior races the palest, and southwestern coastal forms the darkest. There are some exceptions, though, most conspicuously in some island populations that presumably were strongly affected by [[founder effect]]s. The general pattern of variation has a fairly clear divide, southwest of which the birds become notably darker; this agrees quite well with the limit between ''P. sandwichensis'' and ''P. (s.) rostratus''.<ref name = zinketal2005 /><ref name = byersetal1995 /> Savannah sparrows show some variation in size across subspecies. The total length can range from {{convert|11|to|17|cm|in|abbr=on}}, wingspan ranges from {{convert|18|to|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} and body mass from {{convert|15|to|29|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/savannah_sparrow/lifehistory |title=Savannah Sparrow, Life History, All About Birds \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Allaboutbirds.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sproule, Ken |url=http://toronto-wildlife.com/Birds/Sparrows/sparrows.html |title=Sparrows |publisher=Toronto Wildlife |accessdate=2013-03-30}}</ref> In the nominate subspecies, the body weight averages {{convert|20.1|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name= CRC>''CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses'' by John B.

The resident or partially migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between groups, coloration.<ref name = byersetal1995 />\n\n==Behavior==\n{{listen\n| filename = Passerculus sandwichensis - Savannah Sparrow - XC82760.ogg\n| title = Savannah sparrow song\n| description = A Savannah sparrow singing from the edge of a restored prairie in [[Iowa]]\n}}\nThese birds forage on the ground or in low bushes; particularly in winter they are also found in [[grazing|grazed]] low-growth grassland. They mainly eat seeds, but also eat insects in the breeding season. They are typically encountered as pairs or family groups in the breeding season, and assemble in flocks for the winter migration. The flight call is a thin ''seep''.<ref name = byersetal1995 /> ''[[Sensu lato]]'', the Savannah sparrow is considered a [[threatened species]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/><ref name = byersetal1995 /><ref name=Olson/> The song is mixture of ''chirps'' and trills.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nSeventeen subspecies (including the large-billed sparrows) are currently recognized, though many are only described from wintering birds and much of the variation seems to be [[cline (biology)|clinal]]. Four additional subspecies are no longer generally accepted. The complex is usually divided into several groups:\n\n===Savannah sparrows proper===\n[[File:Passerculus-sandwichensis-001.jpg|thumb|right|Probably ''P. s. oblitus'', [[Kirkfield, Ontario]], Canada]]\nAll are migratory; wintering ranges overlap widely.\n* ''P. s. labradorius'', breeds in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Labrador]], and N [[Quebec]]\n* ''P. s. oblitus'', breeds in north [[Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]]\n* ''P. s. savanna'' ('''eastern Savannah sparrow'''), breeds in the northeast US and adjacent Canada (includes ''P. s. mediogriseus'')\n* ''P. s. sandwichensis'' ('''Aleutian Savannah sparrow'''), breeds on the [[Aleutian Islands]] and west [[Alaskan Peninsula]]\n* ''P. s. anthinus'', breeds in the remainder of Alaska, south and east to central [[British Columbia]] and north of the [[Great Plains]] to Manitoba\n* ''P. s. brooksi'' ('''dwarf Savannah sparrow'''), breeds in southernmost British Columbia to northernmost [[California]]\n* ''P. s. alaudinus'', breeds in coastal northern and central California\n* ''P. s. nevadensis'', breeds in the northern Great Plains and the [[Great Basin]]\n* ''P. s. brunnescens'', breeds from central Mexico south to Guatemala (includes ''P. s. rufofuscus'')\n\n''P. s. wetmorei'' is a doubtful subspecies that may breed in the mountains of Guatemala. It is known from only five specimens, collected June 11\u201317, 1897, in [[Huehuetenango Department]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Ipswich sparrow===\nSome post-breeding dispersal. Formerly considered a distinct species.<ref name = zinketal2005/>\n* ''P. s. princeps'', breeds almost exclusively on [[Sable Island]]\n:The Ipswich sparrow is somewhat larger and paler in color than other eastern Savannah sparrows. The breast streaks are narrower and pale brown. Some birds overwinter on the island; others migrate south along the Atlantic coast, usually departing later and returning sooner than mainland birds. Some birds interbreed with ''P. s. savanna'' in [[Nova Scotia]]. These birds frequently raise three broods in a year. This bird was first observed in winter on the dunes near the town of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].\n\n===Large-billed sparrows===\nThe '''large-billed sparrows proper''' are two dark, large and strong-billed subspecies:\n* ''Passerculus rostratus/sandwichensis rostratus'', which breed on the Gulf Coast of northeast [[Baja California]] and northwest [[Sonora]] (some post-breeding dispersal).\n* ''P. r./s. atratus'', resident on the coast of central [[Sonora]] to central [[Sinaloa]] (resident)\n\nThe '''Belding's (Savannah/large-billed) sparrows''' are all-year residents of [[salt marsh]]es of the [[California]]n Pacific coast. They are dark, [[rufous]], and have rather long but not very hefty bills.\n* ''P. r./s. beldingi'', resident on the Pacific coast from [[Morro Bay]], California, to [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]], Baja California (includes ''P. r./s. bryanti'')\n* ''P. r./s. anulus'', resident around [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno Bay]], Baja California\n* ''P. r./s. guttatus'', resident around [[San Ignacio Lagoon]]\n* ''P. r./s. magdalenae'', resident around [[Magdalena Bay]]\n\nThe '''San Benito (Savannah/large-billed) sparrow''' is a resident bird of the [[Islas San Benito]] off Baja California; a stray bird was observed on [[Cedros Island]] on April 21, 1906.<ref name=Thayer/>\n* ''P. r./s. sanctorum''\n:This is a large-bodied and large-billed subspecies, similar to ''rostratus''. They utilize different habitat and their breeding season does not seem to coincide<ref group=notes>For late April 1906, Thayer & Bangs (1907) report nestlings, young birds molting into adult plumage, but no eggs anymore. Rising ''in'' Zink ''et al.'' (2005) found no breeding activity in late April 1999. Consequently, breeding seems to take place in the winter months, with the last young fledging in April/May.</ref> with that of Belding's sparrows. However, their bill size is due to [[convergent evolution]] and their habitat choice simply to the lack of alternatives on their barren island home; altogether, it appears to be a fairly recent offshoot from the Belding's sparrows group. It appears as distinct [[evolution]]arily from these as does the Ipswich sparrow from the Savannah sparrow proper group, only that there seems to have been more [[gene flow]] and/or a larger [[founder population]] in the case of the latter.<ref name = zinketal2005 />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Savannah Sparrow.jpg|Probably ''P. s. sandwichensis'', Alaska\nFile:Passerculus sandwichensis.JPG|Probably ''P. s. anthinus'', Alaska\nFile:Savannah Sparrow chicks in nest.jpg|''P. s. labradorius'' nest\nFile:Savannah Sparrow, Newfoundland.jpg|''P. s. labradorius'', Newfoundland\nFile:Passerculus sandwichensis.jpg|Probably a Belding's sparrow, wintering in California\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name = byersetal1995>Byers, Clive; Olsson, Urban & Curson, Jon (1995): ''Sparrows and Buntings: A Guide to the Sparrows and Buntings of North America and the World''.

It was the only member of the genus ''[[Passerculus]]'' and is typically the only widely accepted member. Comparison of [[mtDNA]] [[NADH dehydrogenase]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]] 2 and 3 [[DNA sequence|sequence]]s indicates that the '''Ipswich sparrow''', formerly usually considered a valid species (as '''''Passerculus princeps'''''), is a well-marked [[subspecies]] of the Savannah sparrow, whereas the southwestern '''large-billed sparrow''' should be recognized as a distinct species (''Passerculus rostratus'').<ref name = zinketal2005/>\n\nThe common name comes from [[Savannah, Georgia]], where one of the first specimens of this bird was collected.\n\n==Distribution==\nThis [[passerine]] [[bird]] breeds in [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], northern, central and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastal United States, [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The Pacific and Mexican breeders are resident, but other populations are [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering from the southern United States across [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] to northern [[South America]]. It is a very rare vagrant to western [[Europe]].<ref name = byersetal1995/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThis species has a typically [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]-like dark-streaked brown back, and whitish underparts with brown or blackish breast and flank streaking. It has whitish crown and [[supercilium]] stripes, sometimes with some yellow (more often near the [[beak]]). The cheeks are brown and the throat white. The [[flight feather]]s are blackish-brown with light brown or white border. The eyes are dark. The feet and legs are horn-colored, as is the lower part of the bill, with the upper part being dark grey.<ref name = byersetal1995 />\n\nThe Savannah sparrow is a very variable species, with numerous [[subspecies]], several of which have been split as separate species at various times. The different forms vary principally in the darkness of the plumage. The variation generally follows [[Gloger's rule]], with Alaskan and interior races the palest, and southwestern coastal forms the darkest. There are some exceptions, though, most conspicuously in some island populations that presumably were strongly affected by [[founder effect]]s. The general pattern of variation has a fairly clear divide, southwest of which the birds become notably darker; this agrees quite well with the limit between ''P. sandwichensis'' and ''P. (s.) rostratus''.<ref name = zinketal2005 /><ref name = byersetal1995 /> Savannah sparrows show some variation in size across subspecies. The total length can range from {{convert|11|to|17|cm|in|abbr=on}}, wingspan ranges from {{convert|18|to|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} and body mass from {{convert|15|to|29|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/savannah_sparrow/lifehistory |title=Savannah Sparrow, Life History, All About Birds \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology |publisher=Allaboutbirds.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sproule, Ken |url=http://toronto-wildlife.com/Birds/Sparrows/sparrows.html |title=Sparrows |publisher=Toronto Wildlife |accessdate=2013-03-30}}</ref> In the nominate subspecies, the body weight averages {{convert|20.1|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name= CRC>''CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses'' by John B.

The resident or partially migratory subspecies are well distinguishable by size and, particularly between groups, coloration.<ref name = byersetal1995 />\n\n==Behavior==\n{{listen\n| filename = Passerculus sandwichensis - Savannah Sparrow - XC82760.ogg\n| title = Savannah sparrow song\n| description = A Savannah sparrow singing from the edge of a restored prairie in [[Iowa]]\n}}\nThese birds forage on the ground or in low bushes; particularly in winter they are also found in [[grazing|grazed]] low-growth grassland. They mainly eat seeds, but also eat insects in the breeding season. They are typically encountered as pairs or family groups in the breeding season, and assemble in flocks for the winter migration. The flight call is a thin ''seep''.<ref name = byersetal1995 /> ''[[Sensu lato]]'', the Savannah sparrow is considered a [[threatened species]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/><ref name = byersetal1995 /><ref name=Olson/> The song is mixture of ''chirps'' and trills.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nSeventeen subspecies (including the large-billed sparrows) are currently recognized, though many are only described from wintering birds and much of the variation seems to be [[cline (biology)|clinal]]. Four additional subspecies are no longer generally accepted. The complex is usually divided into several groups:\n\n===Savannah sparrows proper===\n[[File:Passerculus-sandwichensis-001.jpg|thumb|right|Probably ''P. s. oblitus'', [[Kirkfield, Ontario]], Canada]]\nAll are migratory; wintering ranges overlap widely.\n* ''P. s. labradorius'', breeds in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Labrador]], and N [[Quebec]]\n* ''P. s. oblitus'', breeds in north [[Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]]\n* ''P. s. savanna'' ('''eastern Savannah sparrow'''), breeds in the northeast US and adjacent Canada (includes ''P. s. mediogriseus'')\n* ''P. s. sandwichensis'' ('''Aleutian Savannah sparrow'''), breeds on the [[Aleutian Islands]] and west [[Alaskan Peninsula]]\n* ''P. s. anthinus'', breeds in the remainder of Alaska, south and east to central [[British Columbia]] and north of the [[Great Plains]] to Manitoba\n* ''P. s. brooksi'' ('''dwarf Savannah sparrow'''), breeds in southernmost British Columbia to northernmost [[California]]\n* ''P. s. alaudinus'', breeds in coastal northern and central California\n* ''P. s. nevadensis'', breeds in the northern Great Plains and the [[Great Basin]]\n* ''P. s. brunnescens'', breeds from central Mexico south to Guatemala (includes ''P. s. rufofuscus'')\n\n''P. s. wetmorei'' is a doubtful subspecies that may breed in the mountains of Guatemala. It is known from only five specimens, collected June 11\u201317, 1897, in [[Huehuetenango Department]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Ipswich sparrow===\nSome post-breeding dispersal. Formerly considered a distinct species.<ref name = zinketal2005/>\n* ''P. s. princeps'', breeds almost exclusively on [[Sable Island]]\n:The Ipswich sparrow is somewhat larger and paler in color than other eastern Savannah sparrows. The breast streaks are narrower and pale brown. Some birds overwinter on the island; others migrate south along the Atlantic coast, usually departing later and returning sooner than mainland birds. Some birds interbreed with ''P. s. savanna'' in [[Nova Scotia]]. These birds frequently raise three broods in a year. This bird was first observed in winter on the dunes near the town of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].\n\n===Large-billed sparrows===\nThe '''large-billed sparrows proper''' are two dark, large and strong-billed subspecies:\n* ''Passerculus rostratus/sandwichensis rostratus'', which breed on the Gulf Coast of northeast [[Baja California]] and northwest [[Sonora]] (some post-breeding dispersal).\n* ''P. r./s. atratus'', resident on the coast of central [[Sonora]] to central [[Sinaloa]] (resident)\n\nThe '''Belding's (Savannah/large-billed) sparrows''' are all-year residents of [[salt marsh]]es of the [[California]]n Pacific coast. They are dark, [[rufous]], and have rather long but not very hefty bills.\n* ''P. r./s. beldingi'', resident on the Pacific coast from [[Morro Bay]], California, to [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]], Baja California (includes ''P. r./s. bryanti'')\n* ''P. r./s. anulus'', resident around [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno Bay]], Baja California\n* ''P. r./s. guttatus'', resident around [[San Ignacio Lagoon]]\n* ''P. r./s. magdalenae'', resident around [[Magdalena Bay]]\n\nThe '''San Benito (Savannah/large-billed) sparrow''' is a resident bird of the [[Islas San Benito]] off Baja California; a stray bird was observed on [[Cedros Island]] on April 21, 1906.<ref name=Thayer/>\n* ''P. r./s. sanctorum''\n:This is a large-bodied and large-billed subspecies, similar to ''rostratus''. They utilize different habitat and their breeding season does not seem to coincide<ref group=notes>For late April 1906, Thayer & Bangs (1907) report nestlings, young birds molting into adult plumage, but no eggs anymore. Rising ''in'' Zink ''et al.'' (2005) found no breeding activity in late April 1999. Consequently, breeding seems to take place in the winter months, with the last young fledging in April/May.</ref> with that of Belding's sparrows. However, their bill size is due to [[convergent evolution]] and their habitat choice simply to the lack of alternatives on their barren island home; altogether, it appears to be a fairly recent offshoot from the Belding's sparrows group. It appears as distinct [[evolution]]arily from these as does the Ipswich sparrow from the Savannah sparrow proper group, only that there seems to have been more [[gene flow]] and/or a larger [[founder population]] in the case of the latter.<ref name = zinketal2005 />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Savannah Sparrow.jpg|Probably ''P. s. sandwichensis'', Alaska\nFile:Passerculus sandwichensis.JPG|Probably ''P. s. anthinus'', Alaska\nFile:Savannah Sparrow chicks in nest.jpg|''P. s. labradorius'' nest\nFile:Savannah Sparrow, Newfoundland.jpg|''P. s. labradorius'', Newfoundland\nFile:Passerculus sandwichensis.jpg|Probably a Belding's sparrow, wintering in California\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name = byersetal1995>Byers, Clive; Olsson, Urban & Curson, Jon (1995): ''Sparrows and Buntings: A Guide to the Sparrows and Buntings of North America and the World''.

The game is the online component of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based on [[Southern California]]), ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' allows up to 30 players{{efn|name=players}} to explore the [[open world]] and engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] or competitive game matches. The open-world design lets players [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] San Andreas, which includes open countryside and the fictional city of [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] (based on Los Angeles).\n\nDeveloped in tandem with the single-player mode, ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. At launch, it suffered widespread technical issues resulting in the inability to play missions and loss of character data. It initially polarised reviewers, being criticized for its lack of direction and repetitive missions, with praise particularly directed at the scope and open-ended gameplay.

The protagonist arrives in [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] by plane and is picked up by Lamar Davis, who gives the character a gun and a car. An hour-long tutorial introduces the player to the various game modes, driving, fighting, and game progression mechanics.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> The story is not central in the multiplayer, though it serves as a prequel to the single-player story, where characters from the single-player are woven in.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nSimilar to single-player, players can level up their character's attributes such as driving and stamina. Exclusive to ''GTA Online'' is a system of earning experience, usually by successful completion of activities. Accumulating enough experience to level up unlocks weapons, clothing, car customisations, and more advanced activities (such as parachuting and aircraft). Once unlocked, items need to be purchased with in-game currency, which can be earned or purchased with real money. Players can circumvent an activity's level requirements by joining a game with others of a sufficient rank. There are options to play alone or with friends, and an option for \"Passive Mode\", which makes the player immune to other players.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nAside from the open world, there are three main types of set activities: racing (by car, bike, air or boat), Deathmatch (team or free-for-all), and objective-based Contact Missions (simplified single-player-like storyline jobs, usually cooperative). ''Online'' uses lock-on aim and emphasises stealth in firefights. \"Adversary Mode\" adds several asymmetric variations on these activities, including \"Siege Mentality\" where one team is besieged by another, and \"Hasta La Vista\" where truckers chase down cyclists (reminiscent of the truck/motorcycle chase in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''). \"Survival\" pits a team of up to four players against ten waves of enemies, similar to the Zombies mode in ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]''. The Heists Update released on 10 March 2015 adds five [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] elaborate multi-part missions, each mission having several setup jobs leading up to the finale crime which is a high-profit job. The player who is the heist leader has to unlock each heist in order and pay the upfront costs, while receiving the largest payoff (at the end, if successfully completed) and getting their progress saved, while other players (the crew members) can join any setup/finale jobs without prerequisite and get paid a cut for each mission passed. The heists, all requiring four players except the first which is two-player, often assign specific roles to players such as driver, gunner, etc. and/or may split them apart, and a headset is recommended for communicating with other players.<ref name=\"martin1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto/review/a636845/gta-online-re-review-18-months-on-open-world-multiplayer-lives-up-to-its-potential/ |title=GTA Online re-review: 18 months on, open-world multiplayer lives up to its potential |last=Martin |first=Liam |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gMATGHQY?url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto/review/a636845/gta-online-re-review-18-months-on-open-world-multiplayer-lives-up-to-its-potential/ |archivedate=28 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"mccaffrey2\">{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gta-5-online-heists-hands-on-theyre-real-and-theyre-spectacular?page=2 |title=GTA 5 Online Heists Hand-On: They're Real and They're Spectacular |last=McCaffrey |first=Ryan |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306074952/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gta-5-online-heists-hands-on-theyre-real-and-theyre-spectacular?page=2 |archivedate=6 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game includes a content creation tool that lets players make automobile races and [[deathmatch]]es.<ref name=\"Shacknews: weeks after\"/> Players can choose the location, start and spawn points, and weapon and vehicle drops in deathmatches, and the location, route, race type, and player count in air, land, or sea races.

''[[Digital Spy]]'' reported glitches including loss of his character data. While generally praising the scope of the experience, he considered ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' underwhelming as beholden to pre-launch anticipation let down by its technical issues.<ref name=\"Digital Spy GTA Online\"/> However, reviewers generally recognised the open-ended exploration and dynamic content as the strength of ''Grand Theft Auto Online''.<ref name=\"GameSpot GTA Online\"/><ref name=\"Digital Spy GTA Online\"/><ref name=\"IGN GTA Online\"/> Jon Denton of VideoGamer.com was particularly enthusiastic, and wrote that the \"endlessness\" of the gameplay made up for the technical issues.<ref name=\"VideoGamer GTA Online\"/>\n\nWhen ''Grand Theft Auto V'' was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' received similar critical reactions. IGN's Dan Stapleton reported low player counts in matches, long wait times in lobbies, server disconnection and occasional crashes. \"Because of that,\" he wrote, \"I can't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone\".<ref name=\"IGN Review 2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review |title=GTA 5 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Review |last=Stapleton |first=Dan |date=17 November 2014 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=23 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6UISodAuq?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review |archivedate=23 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> VideoGamer.com found online character progression streamlined by comparison with the original version.

The character creation system was panned as unintuitive, who felt that the system only produced unattractive avatars.<ref name=\"Destructoid GTA Online\"/><ref name=\"Digital Spy GTA Online\"/><ref name=\"IGN GTA Online\"/> MacDonald of IGN noted an \"addictive rhythm\" to character progression and was enthusiastic about some of the job missions, although most eventually became monotonous.<ref name=\"IGN GTA Online\"/> GameSpot's Petit agreed with MacDonald, writing that \"early on, your mission options are dominated by bland [[Last man standing (gaming)|last team standing]] [[deathmatch]]es\".<ref name=\"GameSpot GTA Online\"/> ''Eurogamer's'' Rich Stanton said that the Contact Missions \"tend to work like this: four of you clump up in one or two cars, drive somewhere, spill out and shoot people, drive away\", while lacking a required [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] aspect such that some were possible to complete solo albeit with some difficulty.<ref name=\"eurogamer1\">{{cite web |last=Stanton |first=Rich |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-11-have-gtas-heists-been-worth-the-wait |title=Have GTA's Heists been worth the wait? |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref> GameSpot's Mark Walton wrote that the online mode \"suffers from a lack of direction\" for its open-ended and frenetic gameplay, in contrast to the single-player story, encouraging player behaviour where \"you end up seeing any nearby players as threats and pull out your weapon, ready to gun them down before they gun you down\", which created a distracting \"unending cycle of pointless slaughter\". Walton also noted that the game's reputation system was a weak deterrent against foul play; for instance you would go unpunished for killing another player as long as their vehicle wasn't destroyed. In addition, purchasing vehicles and weapons in-game was prohibitively expensive (especially compared to the single-player mode), which was further exacerbated by low mission payouts, with some suggesting that Rockstar Games was pushing online players towards using real money to [[Microtransaction|buy in-game currency]].<ref name=\"GameSpot Review 2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-review/1900-6415959/ |title=Grand Theft Auto V Review |last=Walton |first=Mark |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=17 November 2014 |accessdate=23 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6UITcWcb5?url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-review/1900-6415959/ |archivedate=23 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"garratt1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2014/08/26/gta-5-gta-online-dlc-1-16-san-andreas-flight-school-missions-nerfed/ |title=GTA Online\u2019s Flight School and patch 1.16 leveled the game \u2013 and it\u2019s for the best |last=Garratt |first=Patrick |work=[[VG247]] |publisher=[[Gamer Network]] |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gMAOHk1x?url=https://www.vg247.com/2014/08/26/gta-5-gta-online-dlc-1-16-san-andreas-flight-school-missions-nerfed/ |archivedate=28 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCritical reception of ''GTA Online'' has improved over time. The ''San Andreas Flight School'' update created incentives for players to try the previously neglected aircraft missions and take advantage of the game's \"sensational\" flight modelling, while also more fairly balancing mission payouts relative to their difficulty.<ref name=\"garratt1\"/> The Heists update was also well-received: Liam Martin of [[Digital Spy]] wrote that the update \"strike[s] a great balance between the team and the individual\", praising the update for encouraging \"pinpoint coordination\",<ref name=\"martin1\"/> while IGN's Ryan McCaffrey applauded the replayability and unpredictability.<ref name=\"mccaffrey2\"/> ''Eurogamer's'' Rich Stanton praised the four-player Heists for testing co-ordination as a group by \"forcing players to adopt different starting positions\" which \"add[s] a layer of strategy that wasn't there before\" which is important since the death of one player often forces the team to restart, which was lacking in the Contact Missions. There has been some criticism of the Heists for poorly-placed or absent mission checkpoints, the unnecessary long drives at the start of missions, and frequent technical issues that caused long waiting periods and mid-mission server disconnections.<ref name=\"eurogamer1\"/>\n\n=== Awards ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Grand Theft Auto V}}\n\n''Grand Theft Auto Online'' won Best

It was released on 1 October 2013 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], and was released on 18 November 2014 for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Microsoft Windows]] version on 14 April 2015. The game is the online component of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based on [[Southern California]]), ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' allows up to 30 players{{efn|name=players}} to explore the [[open world]] and engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] or competitive game matches. The open-world design lets players [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] San Andreas, which includes open countryside and the fictional city of [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] (based on Los Angeles).\n\nDeveloped in tandem with the single-player mode, ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. At launch, it suffered widespread technical issues resulting in the inability to play missions and loss of character data. It initially polarised reviewers, being criticized for its lack of direction and repetitive missions, with praise particularly directed at the scope and open-ended gameplay. It won divided [[List of accolades received by Grand Theft Auto V|year-end accolades]], ranging from Biggest Disappointment to Best Multiplayer, from several gaming publications. The game receives frequent free updates that further expand on the game modes and content, which has improved critical reception. The 2015 ''Heists'' update had been especially well-received by the critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gta-5-online-heists-hands-on-theyre-real-and-theyre-spectacular |title=GTA 5 Online Heists Hands-On: They're Real And They're Spectacular |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDeveloped in tandem with ''Grand Theft Auto V'', ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/423020/gta-v-interview-rockstar-north-president-leslie-benzies-on-gta-online/ |title=Interview: Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies on GTA Online and GTA V |last=Weaver |first=Tim |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> Up to 30 players{{efn|name=players|The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' allow up to 16 concurrent players,<ref name=\"Persistent\"/> while the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions allow up to 30 concurrent players.<ref name=\"ReReleaseDate\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52308/grand-theft-auto-v-release-dates-and-exclusive-content |title=Grand Theft Auto V Release Dates and Exclusive Content Details for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC |author=R* Q |work=Rockstar Newswire |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>}} freely roam across a re-creation of the single-player world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes).<ref name=\"Persistent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/424264/gta-online-first-look-rockstars-persistent-online-world-is-its-most-ambitious-project-in-years/ |title=GTA Online first look: Rockstar's persistent online world is its most ambitious project in years |last=Dawkins |first=Daniel |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817062416/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/424264/gta-online-first-look-rockstars-persistent-online-world-is-its-most-ambitious-project-in-years/ |archivedate=17 August 2013}}</ref> The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and [[deathmatch]] weapon [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawn points]].<ref name=\"CVG-online\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-grand-theft-auto-online-is-crazy-enough-to-work/1100-6412714/ |title=Why Grand Theft Auto Online is Crazy Enough to Work |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |last=McInnis |first=Shaun |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018003853/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-grand-theft-auto-online-is-crazy-enough-to-work/1100-6412714/ |archivedate=18 October 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together.

The protagonist arrives in [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] by plane and is picked up by Lamar Davis, who gives the character a gun and a car. An hour-long tutorial introduces the player to the various game modes, driving, fighting, and game progression mechanics.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> The story is not central in the multiplayer, though it serves as a prequel to the single-player story, where characters from the single-player are woven in.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nSimilar to single-player, players can level up their character's attributes such as driving and stamina. Exclusive to ''GTA Online'' is a system of earning experience, usually by successful completion of activities. Accumulating enough experience to level up unlocks weapons, clothing, car customisations, and more advanced activities (such as parachuting and aircraft). Once unlocked, items need to be purchased with in-game currency, which can be earned or purchased with real money. Players can circumvent an activity's level requirements by joining a game with others of a sufficient rank. There are options to play alone or with friends, and an option for \"Passive Mode\", which makes the player immune to other players.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nAside from the open world, there are three main types of set activities: racing (by car, bike, air or boat), Deathmatch (team or free-for-all), and objective-based Contact Missions (simplified single-player-like storyline jobs, usually cooperative). ''Online'' uses lock-on aim and emphasises stealth in firefights. \"Adversary Mode\" adds several asymmetric variations on these activities, including \"Siege Mentality\" where one team is besieged by another, and \"Hasta La Vista\" where truckers chase down cyclists (reminiscent of the truck/motorcycle chase in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''). \"Survival\" pits a team of up to four players against ten waves of enemies, similar to the Zombies mode in ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]''. The Heists Update released on 10 March 2015 adds five [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] elaborate multi-part missions, each mission having several setup jobs leading up to the finale crime which is a high-profit job. The player who is the heist leader has to unlock each heist in order and pay the upfront costs, while receiving the largest payoff (at the end, if successfully completed) and getting their progress saved, while other players (the crew members) can join any setup/finale jobs without prerequisite and get paid a cut for each mission passed. The heists, all requiring four players except the first which is two-player, often assign specific roles to players such as driver, gunner, etc. and/or may split them apart, and a headset is recommended for communicating with other players.<ref name=\"martin1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto/review/a636845/gta-online-re-review-18-months-on-open-world-multiplayer-lives-up-to-its-potential/ |title=GTA Online re-review: 18 months on, open-world multiplayer lives up to its potential |last=Martin |first=Liam |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gMATGHQY?url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto/review/a636845/gta-online-re-review-18-months-on-open-world-multiplayer-lives-up-to-its-potential/ |archivedate=28 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"mccaffrey2\">{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gta-5-online-heists-hands-on-theyre-real-and-theyre-spectacular?page=2 |title=GTA 5 Online Heists Hand-On: They're Real and They're Spectacular |last=McCaffrey |first=Ryan |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=5 March 2015 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306074952/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/05/gta-5-online-heists-hands-on-theyre-real-and-theyre-spectacular?page=2 |archivedate=6 March 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game includes a content creation tool that lets players make automobile races and [[deathmatch]]es.<ref name=\"Shacknews: weeks after\"/> Players can choose the location, start and spawn points, and weapon and vehicle drops in deathmatches, and the location, route, race type, and player count in air, land, or sea races.

The character creation system was panned as unintuitive, who felt that the system only produced unattractive avatars.<ref name=\"Destructoid GTA Online\"/><ref name=\"Digital Spy GTA Online\"/><ref name=\"IGN GTA Online\"/> MacDonald of IGN noted an \"addictive rhythm\" to character progression and was enthusiastic about some of the job missions, although most eventually became monotonous.<ref name=\"IGN GTA Online\"/> GameSpot's Petit agreed with MacDonald, writing that \"early on, your mission options are dominated by bland [[Last man standing (gaming)|last team standing]] [[deathmatch]]es\".<ref name=\"GameSpot GTA Online\"/> ''Eurogamer's'' Rich Stanton said that the Contact Missions \"tend to work like this: four of you clump up in one or two cars, drive somewhere, spill out and shoot people, drive away\", while lacking a required [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] aspect such that some were possible to complete solo albeit with some difficulty.<ref name=\"eurogamer1\">{{cite web |last=Stanton |first=Rich |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-11-have-gtas-heists-been-worth-the-wait |title=Have GTA's Heists been worth the wait? |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref> GameSpot's Mark Walton wrote that the online mode \"suffers from a lack of direction\" for its open-ended and frenetic gameplay, in contrast to the single-player story, encouraging player behaviour where \"you end up seeing any nearby players as threats and pull out your weapon, ready to gun them down before they gun you down\", which created a distracting \"unending cycle of pointless slaughter\". Walton also noted that the game's reputation system was a weak deterrent against foul play; for instance you would go unpunished for killing another player as long as their vehicle wasn't destroyed. In addition, purchasing vehicles and weapons in-game was prohibitively expensive (especially compared to the single-player mode), which was further exacerbated by low mission payouts, with some suggesting that Rockstar Games was pushing online players towards using real money to [[Microtransaction|buy in-game currency]].<ref name=\"GameSpot Review 2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-review/1900-6415959/ |title=Grand Theft Auto V Review |last=Walton |first=Mark |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=17 November 2014 |accessdate=23 November 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6UITcWcb5?url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-5-ps4-xbox-one-review/1900-6415959/ |archivedate=23 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"garratt1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vg247.com/2014/08/26/gta-5-gta-online-dlc-1-16-san-andreas-flight-school-missions-nerfed/ |title=GTA Online\u2019s Flight School and patch 1.16 leveled the game \u2013 and it\u2019s for the best |last=Garratt |first=Patrick |work=[[VG247]] |publisher=[[Gamer Network]] |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=29 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gMAOHk1x?url=https://www.vg247.com/2014/08/26/gta-5-gta-online-dlc-1-16-san-andreas-flight-school-missions-nerfed/ |archivedate=28 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCritical reception of ''GTA Online'' has improved over time. The ''San Andreas Flight School'' update created incentives for players to try the previously neglected aircraft missions and take advantage of the game's \"sensational\" flight modelling, while also more fairly balancing mission payouts relative to their difficulty.<ref name=\"garratt1\"/> The Heists update was also well-received: Liam Martin of [[Digital Spy]] wrote that the update \"strike[s] a great balance between the team and the individual\", praising the update for encouraging \"pinpoint coordination\",<ref name=\"martin1\"/> while IGN's Ryan McCaffrey applauded the replayability and unpredictability.<ref name=\"mccaffrey2\"/> ''Eurogamer's'' Rich Stanton praised the four-player Heists for testing co-ordination as a group by \"forcing players to adopt different starting positions\" which \"add[s] a layer of strategy that wasn't there before\" which is important since the death of one player often forces the team to restart, which was lacking in the Contact Missions. There has been some criticism of the Heists for poorly-placed or absent mission checkpoints, the unnecessary long drives at the start of missions, and frequent technical issues that caused long waiting periods and mid-mission server disconnections.<ref name=\"eurogamer1\"/>\n\n=== Awards ===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Grand Theft Auto V}}\n\n''Grand Theft Auto Online'' won Best

Dur\u00e1n was known as a versatile, technical [[brawler (boxing)|brawler]] and [[pressure fighter]], which earned him the nickname of \"''Manos de Piedra''\" (\"Hands of Stone\") for his formidable punching power and excellent defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Giudice | first = Christian | title = Hands of Stone: The Life and Legend of Roberto Dur\u00e1n | publisher = Milo Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-903854-55-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dur\u00e1n was voted by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine as the fifth greatest fighter of the last 80 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/history/a/ring_80_best.htm|title=Ring Magazine's 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years|author=Andrew Eisele|work=About.com Sports}}</ref> while boxing historian [[Bert Sugar]] rated him as the eighth greatest fighter of all time.

Dur\u00e1n finally retired for good in January 2002 at age 50, following a car crash in [[Argentina]] in October 2001, after which Dur\u00e1n had required life saving surgery. Dur\u00e1n had previously retired in November 1980, June 1984 and August 1998, only to change his mind. Dur\u00e1n ended his career with a professional record of 119 fights, 103 wins, and 70 [[knockout]]s. From May 1971 up until his second fight against [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in November 1980, as well as in his fight against [[Wilfred Ben\u00edtez]] in January 1982, Dur\u00e1n was trained by legendary boxing trainer [[Ray Arcel]].\n\n== Early life ==\nRoberto Dur\u00e1n was born on June 16, 1951 in [[Guarar\u00e9]], Panama. His mother, Clara Samaniego, was a native of Guarar\u00e9, and his father, Margarito Dur\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, was from [[Arizona|Arizona, United States]], and of Mexican descent.<ref>Giudice, Christian (2009).

As Duran continued punching, the referee, Johnny LoBianco, grabbed him to pull him away. He pulled down on Duran's arms, which led to a seemingly accidental low blow. Buchanan dropped to the canvas in pain. His trainer Gil Clancy later said he had believed the blow to have been caused by a knee. Duran was not disqualified from the bout; instead, he was deemed as winner by thirteenth-round technical knockout.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/21/sports/johnny-lobianco-85-referee-in-controversial-duran-bout.html \"Johnny LoBianco, 85, Referee In Controversial Duran Bout\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 21, 2001.

Later that year, in another non-title bout, he lost a ten-round decision to [[Esteban De Jes\u00fas]]. Dur\u00e1n got back on track with successful title defenses against Jimmy Robertson, [[Hector Thompson]] and future Lightweight Champion [[Guts Ishimatsu]]. In 1974, Dur\u00e1n avenged his loss to De Jesus with a brutal eleventh round knock out. In 1976, he defeated future [[Light Welterweight]] Champion [[Saoul Mamby]]. Overall, Dur\u00e1n made twelve successful defenses of his title (eleven coming by knockout) and amassed a record of 62\u20131, his last defense coming in 1978 when Dur\u00e1n fought a third bout with De Jesus in a unification match wherein Dur\u00e1n once again knocked out De Jesus and captured his [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Lightweight Championship. Dur\u00e1n gave up the [[Undisputed Champion|Undisputed]] Lightweight Championship in February 1979.\n\n=== Welterweight and The Brawl in Montreal===\nVacating the Lightweight title was a buildup for an attempt at the [[Welterweight]] title. Dur\u00e1n earned wins against former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Welterweight Champion [[Carlos Palomino]] and Zeferino Gonzales, among others, setting the stage for a title bout against then-undefeated WBC [[List of welterweight boxing champions|Welterweight Champion]] [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. The venue chosen was the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] (the same location where Leonard won an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]). Dur\u00e1n resented the fact that he was getting only one-fifth of the money that Leonard was getting, despite the fact that Dur\u00e1n was entering the bout with an incredible 71\u20131 record and seen by many as the best boxer of the 1970s decade that had just ended. To the surprise of Leonard and his camp, who had expected a warm homecoming from the place where Leonard had won Olympic gold, Leonard only got a mixed reception in Montreal, while Dur\u00e1n was incredibly popular with the crowd, with Leonard later admitting that Dur\u00e1n's popularity in Canada \"threw me for a loop\". On June 20, 1980, Dur\u00e1n captured the WBC Welterweight title by defeating Leonard via a 15-round unanimous decision (145\u2013144, 148\u2013147, 146\u2013144), although it was incorrectly announced as a majority decision in the ring with the 148\u2013147 scorecard being incorrectly announced as 147\u2013147.<ref>http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:560</ref> The fight became known as \"The Brawl in Montreal\".\n\n==== \"No M\u00e1s\" in New Orleans ====\nAfter defeating Leonard in Montreal, Dur\u00e1n gained iconic status in his home country, Panama. Leonard initiated the rematch clause and asked for the fight to be the following November. In their second fight, Leonard successfully changed his tactics, using more footwork and movement than he had in their first fight, and Dur\u00e1n was unable to get Leonard against the ropes. During the seventh round, after Leonard had gained a slight lead on the scorecards, he began taunting and mocking Dur\u00e1n. Towards the end of the eighth round, Dur\u00e1n suddenly stopped fighting, and according to referee Octavio Meyran and ABC commentator [[Howard Cosell]], Dur\u00e1n repeatedly said \"No m\u00e1s\" (\"no more\"), which was denied by Dur\u00e1n, his cornermen Ray Arcel and Freddie Brown, and his manager Carlos Eleta, with Dur\u00e1n claiming he had said \"No quiero pelear con el payaso\" (\"I do not want to fight with this clown (Leonard)\"). According to Meyran, in addition to saying \"No m\u00e1s\", Dur\u00e1n also said in broken English \"I don't box anymore\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Pepe|first=Phil|title=Roberto Duran quits in 8th, says 'No mas' in 1980 fight vs. Sugar Ray Leonard|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/duran-quits-8th-finished-article-1.1994724|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 26, 1980|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Snowden|first=Jonathan|title=The Men and the Myths: Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran and 'No Mas,' 35 Years Later|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2592855-the-men-and-the-myths-ray-leonard-roberto-duran-and-no-mas-35-years-later|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref> In a 2016 interview, Duran claimed that what he actually said was, \"No Sigo\" (\"I won't go on\").

Dur\u00e1n was also to lose his comeback fight in September 1982 in Detroit. [[Kirkland Laing]], from London, shocked the boxing world, producing the type of display his talents promised yet he so rarely produced, taking the split decision. After being relegated to a 10-round walk out win over Englishman [[Jimmy Batten]] at [[The Battle of the Champions (boxing)|The Battle of The Champions]] in [[Miami]], Dur\u00e1n signed with promoter [[Bob Arum]]. This marked the beginning of a comeback in which he beat former world champion and now hall of famer [[Pipino Cuevas]] via a fourth round knock-out, which earned him a second crack at the light middleweight title, this time against [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Champion [[Davey Moore (1980s)|Davey Moore]].\n\nThe WBA title bout took place at [[Madison Square Garden]] on June 16, 1983, which also happened to be Dur\u00e1n's 32nd birthday. The still inexperienced Moore (12\u20130) was game through the first three rounds, but by the 4th, Dur\u00e1n said he knew Moore couldn't hurt him, and an onslaught began.<ref name=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120968/1/index.htm\">He That Was Lost Has Been Found, ''Sports Illustrated'', June 27, 1983</ref> The pro-Dur\u00e1n crowd at ringside cheered as Dur\u00e1n relentlessly punished Moore. By the end of the sixth round, Moore's eye had swollen shut and he was floored near the end of the seventh. Finally the fight was stopped in the eighth round as Moore was taking such a horrific beating and Dur\u00e1n won his third world title. After the victory, Dur\u00e1n was hoisted up in the air as the crowd sang \"Happy Birthday\" to a sobbing Dur\u00e1n.<ref name=\"Boxingfanatics.com\">[http://www.boxingfanatics.com/duran2.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414181800/http://www.boxingfanatics.com/duran2.html |date=April 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDur\u00e1n later fought for the World [[Middleweight]] Championship, meeting [[Marvelous Marvin Hagler]] in Las Vegas in November 1983. During the fight, Duran broke his hand and lost in a very competitive fight that went the full fifteen rounds. After 13 rounds, two of the judges had Dur\u00e1n one point ahead, and the other judge had it even. Hagler fought tenaciously to win the final two rounds and get a unanimous decision victory. Despite the loss, Dur\u00e1n became the second man to take Hagler to a fifteen-round decision ([[Vito Antuofermo]] was the other) and the only one to do so while Hagler was the world champion.\n\nIn June 1984, Dur\u00e1n was stripped of his Light Middleweight title when the WBA did not approve of his fight with WBC Champion [[Thomas Hearns|Thomas \"Hitman\" Hearns]] and took away recognition of Dur\u00e1n as world champion the moment Dur\u00e1n stepped into the ring to box Hearns. Dur\u00e1n again made history in the fight, but this time it was the wrong kind. Hearns dropped Dur\u00e1n twice in the first round and as he rose to his feet after the second knockdown, which ended the round, the former champion did not know where his corner was. Hearns went on to knock Duran down a third time in the second round and the fight was stopped, marking the first time in his career that Dur\u00e1n had been knocked out in a fight (the \"No M\u00e1s\" fight was officially recorded as a technical knockout, because Duran quit). Dur\u00e1n then retired for a second time, but changed his mind over a year later, and was back fighting in early 1986.\n\nDur\u00e1n did not contend another title fight until 1989, but made the shot count when he won the WBC Middleweight title from [[Iran Barkley]] in February. The fight is considered one of Dur\u00e1n's greatest achievements, as the 37-year-old former lightweight champion took the middleweight crown, his fourth title. In a tough, back-and-forth fight, Dur\u00e1n knocked Barkley down in the eleventh round and Dur\u00e1n won a split decision (118\u2013112, 116\u2013112, 113\u2013116). The bout was named the 1989 \"Fight of the Year\" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''.\n\n=== Super middleweight ===\n{{main|Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Dur\u00e1n III}}\nDuran moved up to [[super middleweight]] for a third fight with [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in December 1989 (a fight dubbed ''Uno M\u00e1s'' \u2014 One More \u2014 by promoters), where Leonard's WBC super-middleweight title was on the line, although Leonard's camp insisted that the fight with Dur\u00e1n be at a 162lbs catchweight instead of the 168lbs super-middleweight limit that Dur\u00e1n favoured. In the end, both weighed in below the 160lbs middleweight limit. Dur\u00e1n was uncharacteristically flat for most of what was a strange fight. Although Leonard won the fight by a wide unanimous decision (120\u2013110, 119\u2013109, 116\u2013111), by the end of the fight Leonard looked the worse for wear as he had suffered several bad cuts. Leonard's lip was busted by a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required more than 60 stitches. Dur\u00e1n didn't fight again until 1991, so had given up his WBC middleweight crown that he had won against Barkley. Dur\u00e1n seemed to be in decline after the third fight against Leonard, but Dur\u00e1n persisted and worked his way into title shots for the lesser IBC super-middleweight and middleweight titles in 1994, 1995 and 1996.\n\nDur\u00e1n fought [[Vinny Pazienza]] twice, in June 1994 and January 1995, for the IBC Super Middleweight Championship, with Pazienza winning both times by unanimous decision. In the first fight, Dur\u00e1n put Pazienza down in Rounds 2 and 5, but referee Joe Cortez controversially ruled the Round 2 knockdown to be a slip. The first fight divided the people watching as some felt that Dur\u00e1n had won a close fight, but others felt that Pazienza had won either narrowly or widely after finishing strongly in the last five rounds. The second fight was more lopsided in Pazienza's favour, as despite the official judges giving Pazienza the win by scores of 116\u2013112, 117\u2013111 and 118\u2013110, the TV commentators expressed puzzlement at the closeness of the official scoring as they thought that Pazienza had won every round in a 120\u2013108 shutout.\n\nIn 1996, Dur\u00e1n fought [[H\u00e9ctor Camacho]] for the vacant IBC Middleweight Championship. At the end of the fight, fans and TV commentators seemed in complete agreement that Dur\u00e1n had won the fight in an excellent performance, but the three judges saw the fight very differently and awarded Camacho the victory by a very controversial unanimous decision. Dur\u00e1n's old rival, Sugar Ray Leonard, commentating at ringside, was baffled at the scoring and called it an early Christmas gift for Camacho, with the result motivating Leonard enough to come out of a 6-year boxing retirement to face Camacho himself in 1997. In 1997, Dur\u00e1n was defeated by former champion [[Jorge Castro (boxer)|Jorge Castro]] in Argentina. Dur\u00e1n then fought Castro in a rematch bout in Panama and won via unanimous decision, maintaining his unbeaten record in Panama.\n\nIn 1998, at the age of 47, he challenged 28-year-old WBA Middleweight Champion [[William Joppy]]. Joppy, a trim, quick-fisted fighter, battered Dur\u00e1n to defeat in just 3 rounds. It was Duran's most emphatic loss since the Hearns fight, over a decade earlier. Dur\u00e1n then announced his retirement for the third time in August 1998, but soon changed his mind and was back fighting in March 1999.\n\nIn June 2000, Dur\u00e1n avenged a previous loss to Pat Lawlor from 9 years before and won the NBA Super Middleweight Championship on his 49th birthday. He lost the title a year later to H\u00e9ctor Camacho in a rematch bout and in what would be Dur\u00e1n's final fight.\n\n== Retirement ==\n[[File:Roberto Duran signing autographs in Jan 2014.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Duran signs autographs at a Houston sports collectors show in January 2014.]][[File:Duran and Mosley.jpg|250px|thumb|Dur\u00e1n training [[Shane Mosley]] for his fight against [[David Avanesyan]], 2016]]\nIn October 2001, Dur\u00e1n traveled to [[Argentina]] to promote a [[salsa music]] CD that he had just released. While there, he was involved in a car crash and required life-saving surgery. After that incident, he announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 50.<ref name=\"retirement\">{{cite web | title=Roberto Duran quits boxing at 50 after car crash | work=usatoday.com | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/stories/2002-01-26-duran.htm |accessdate=January 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nAnnouncing his retirement, Dur\u00e1n cited the weight issues of his friend, Argentinian football legend [[Diego Maradona]], as motivation for getting back in shape, stating \"as of now, I am exercising so that when the [retirement] honors arrive the people will see me in shape. I don't want to [look] like Maradona did, all fat.\"<ref name=\"retirement\"/>\n\nDur\u00e1n's five world title belts, which he won in four different divisions, were stolen from his house in Panama in 1993 during a robbery allegedly staged by his brother-in-law, who gave them to memorabilia seller Luis Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez, who will stand trial for trying to sell stolen goods. Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez allegedly sold the belts to undercover [[FBI]] agents. He alleges that Dur\u00e1n authorized the sale of the five belts to him during a time that Dur\u00e1n was facing financial trouble. On September 23, 2003, a federal judge in [[Florida]] ordered the five belts returned to Dur\u00e1n.\n\nHis 70 wins by knockout place him in an exclusive group of boxers who have won 50 or more fights by knockout. He is ranked number 28 on ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'''s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.\n\nOn October 14, 2006, Dur\u00e1n was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Riverside, California,<ref>{{cite web | title=Duran inducted into World Boxing Hall of Fame | work=espn.com | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2626319 |accessdate=October 15, 2006}}</ref> and on June 10, 2007, into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in Canastota, New York.\n\nToday he is the brand ambassador of [[Panama Blue]], Panama's premium bottled water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prensa.com/impreso/rempresarial/2013-10-12|title=Rese\u00f1a Empresarial \u2013 La Prensa|work=La Prensa|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuran is a licensed ultralight aircraft pilot in Panama.

Samaniego''' (born June 16, 1951) is a [[Panama]]nian former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1968 to 2001. He held [[quadruple champion|world championships in four weight classes]]: [[lightweight]], [[welterweight]], [[light middleweight]] and [[middleweight]], as well as reigns as the [[undisputed champion|undisputed]] and [[lineal championship|lineal]] lightweight champion, and the lineal welterweight champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/pastchp.htm|title=The Lineal Boxing World Champions|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone}}</ref> He is also the second boxer to have competed over a span of five decades, the first being [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]. Dur\u00e1n was known as a versatile, technical [[brawler (boxing)|brawler]] and [[pressure fighter]], which earned him the nickname of \"''Manos de Piedra''\" (\"Hands of Stone\") for his formidable punching power and excellent defense.<ref>{{cite book | last = Giudice | first = Christian | title = Hands of Stone: The Life and Legend of Roberto Dur\u00e1n | publisher = Milo Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-903854-55-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dur\u00e1n was voted by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine as the fifth greatest fighter of the last 80 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/history/a/ring_80_best.htm|title=Ring Magazine's 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years|author=Andrew Eisele|work=About.com Sports}}</ref> while boxing historian [[Bert Sugar]] rated him as the eighth greatest fighter of all time. The [[Associated Press]] voted him as the best lightweight of the 20th century,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/boxing/news/1999/1208/221260.html|title=ESPN.com: BOXING \u2013 AP Fighters of the Century list|work=go.com}}</ref> with many considering him the greatest lightweight of all time. Dur\u00e1n finally retired for good in January 2002 at age 50, following a car crash in [[Argentina]] in October 2001, after which Dur\u00e1n had required life saving surgery. Dur\u00e1n had previously retired in November 1980, June 1984 and August 1998, only to change his mind. Dur\u00e1n ended his career with a professional record of 119 fights, 103 wins, and 70 [[knockout]]s. From May 1971 up until his second fight against [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in November 1980, as well as in his fight against [[Wilfred Ben\u00edtez]] in January 1982, Dur\u00e1n was trained by legendary boxing trainer [[Ray Arcel]].\n\n== Early life ==\nRoberto Dur\u00e1n was born on June 16, 1951 in [[Guarar\u00e9]], Panama. His mother, Clara Samaniego, was a native of Guarar\u00e9, and his father, Margarito Dur\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, was from [[Arizona|Arizona, United States]], and of Mexican descent.<ref>Giudice, Christian (2009).

Dur\u00e1n, as a 2-to-1 underdog, scored a knockdown against the defending champion just fifteen seconds into the opening round and battered him throughout the bout.<ref>{{cite news |title=Duran Reigns amid Controversy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WkM_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=zlEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3473,5247048 |work=[[The Windsor Star]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 27, 1972 |via=Google News Archive Search |page=30 |accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref> He was well ahead on all three cards as the bell rang to end the 13th round, at which time Dur\u00e1n (apparently not hearing the bell) continued to throw a couple of extra punches as Buchanan lay on the ropes. As Duran continued punching, the referee, Johnny LoBianco, grabbed him to pull him away. He pulled down on Duran's arms, which led to a seemingly accidental low blow. Buchanan dropped to the canvas in pain. His trainer Gil Clancy later said he had believed the blow to have been caused by a knee. Duran was not disqualified from the bout; instead, he was deemed as winner by thirteenth-round technical knockout.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/21/sports/johnny-lobianco-85-referee-in-controversial-duran-bout.html \"Johnny LoBianco, 85, Referee In Controversial Duran Bout\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 21, 2001.

Later that year, in another non-title bout, he lost a ten-round decision to [[Esteban De Jes\u00fas]]. Dur\u00e1n got back on track with successful title defenses against Jimmy Robertson, [[Hector Thompson]] and future Lightweight Champion [[Guts Ishimatsu]]. In 1974, Dur\u00e1n avenged his loss to De Jesus with a brutal eleventh round knock out. In 1976, he defeated future [[Light Welterweight]] Champion [[Saoul Mamby]]. Overall, Dur\u00e1n made twelve successful defenses of his title (eleven coming by knockout) and amassed a record of 62\u20131, his last defense coming in 1978 when Dur\u00e1n fought a third bout with De Jesus in a unification match wherein Dur\u00e1n once again knocked out De Jesus and captured his [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Lightweight Championship. Dur\u00e1n gave up the [[Undisputed Champion|Undisputed]] Lightweight Championship in February 1979.\n\n=== Welterweight and The Brawl in Montreal===\nVacating the Lightweight title was a buildup for an attempt at the [[Welterweight]] title. Dur\u00e1n earned wins against former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Welterweight Champion [[Carlos Palomino]] and Zeferino Gonzales, among others, setting the stage for a title bout against then-undefeated WBC [[List of welterweight boxing champions|Welterweight Champion]] [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. The venue chosen was the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] (the same location where Leonard won an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]). Dur\u00e1n resented the fact that he was getting only one-fifth of the money that Leonard was getting, despite the fact that Dur\u00e1n was entering the bout with an incredible 71\u20131 record and seen by many as the best boxer of the 1970s decade that had just ended. To the surprise of Leonard and his camp, who had expected a warm homecoming from the place where Leonard had won Olympic gold, Leonard only got a mixed reception in Montreal, while Dur\u00e1n was incredibly popular with the crowd, with Leonard later admitting that Dur\u00e1n's popularity in Canada \"threw me for a loop\". On June 20, 1980, Dur\u00e1n captured the WBC Welterweight title by defeating Leonard via a 15-round unanimous decision (145\u2013144, 148\u2013147, 146\u2013144), although it was incorrectly announced as a majority decision in the ring with the 148\u2013147 scorecard being incorrectly announced as 147\u2013147.<ref>http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:560</ref> The fight became known as \"The Brawl in Montreal\".\n\n==== \"No M\u00e1s\" in New Orleans ====\nAfter defeating Leonard in Montreal, Dur\u00e1n gained iconic status in his home country, Panama. Leonard initiated the rematch clause and asked for the fight to be the following November. In their second fight, Leonard successfully changed his tactics, using more footwork and movement than he had in their first fight, and Dur\u00e1n was unable to get Leonard against the ropes. During the seventh round, after Leonard had gained a slight lead on the scorecards, he began taunting and mocking Dur\u00e1n. Towards the end of the eighth round, Dur\u00e1n suddenly stopped fighting, and according to referee Octavio Meyran and ABC commentator [[Howard Cosell]], Dur\u00e1n repeatedly said \"No m\u00e1s\" (\"no more\"), which was denied by Dur\u00e1n, his cornermen Ray Arcel and Freddie Brown, and his manager Carlos Eleta, with Dur\u00e1n claiming he had said \"No quiero pelear con el payaso\" (\"I do not want to fight with this clown (Leonard)\"). According to Meyran, in addition to saying \"No m\u00e1s\", Dur\u00e1n also said in broken English \"I don't box anymore\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Pepe|first=Phil|title=Roberto Duran quits in 8th, says 'No mas' in 1980 fight vs. Sugar Ray Leonard|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/duran-quits-8th-finished-article-1.1994724|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=November 26, 1980|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Snowden|first=Jonathan|title=The Men and the Myths: Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran and 'No Mas,' 35 Years Later|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2592855-the-men-and-the-myths-ray-leonard-roberto-duran-and-no-mas-35-years-later|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref> In a 2016 interview, Duran claimed that what he actually said was, \"No Sigo\" (\"I won't go on\").

Dur\u00e1n was also to lose his comeback fight in September 1982 in Detroit. [[Kirkland Laing]], from London, shocked the boxing world, producing the type of display his talents promised yet he so rarely produced, taking the split decision. After being relegated to a 10-round walk out win over Englishman [[Jimmy Batten]] at [[The Battle of the Champions (boxing)|The Battle of The Champions]] in [[Miami]], Dur\u00e1n signed with promoter [[Bob Arum]]. This marked the beginning of a comeback in which he beat former world champion and now hall of famer [[Pipino Cuevas]] via a fourth round knock-out, which earned him a second crack at the light middleweight title, this time against [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Champion [[Davey Moore (1980s)|Davey Moore]].\n\nThe WBA title bout took place at [[Madison Square Garden]] on June 16, 1983, which also happened to be Dur\u00e1n's 32nd birthday. The still inexperienced Moore (12\u20130) was game through the first three rounds, but by the 4th, Dur\u00e1n said he knew Moore couldn't hurt him, and an onslaught began.<ref name=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120968/1/index.htm\">He That Was Lost Has Been Found, ''Sports Illustrated'', June 27, 1983</ref> The pro-Dur\u00e1n crowd at ringside cheered as Dur\u00e1n relentlessly punished Moore. By the end of the sixth round, Moore's eye had swollen shut and he was floored near the end of the seventh. Finally the fight was stopped in the eighth round as Moore was taking such a horrific beating and Dur\u00e1n won his third world title. After the victory, Dur\u00e1n was hoisted up in the air as the crowd sang \"Happy Birthday\" to a sobbing Dur\u00e1n.<ref name=\"Boxingfanatics.com\">[http://www.boxingfanatics.com/duran2.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414181800/http://www.boxingfanatics.com/duran2.html |date=April 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nDur\u00e1n later fought for the World [[Middleweight]] Championship, meeting [[Marvelous Marvin Hagler]] in Las Vegas in November 1983. During the fight, Duran broke his hand and lost in a very competitive fight that went the full fifteen rounds. After 13 rounds, two of the judges had Dur\u00e1n one point ahead, and the other judge had it even. Hagler fought tenaciously to win the final two rounds and get an unanimous decision victory. Despite the loss, Dur\u00e1n became the second man to take Hagler to a fifteen-round decision ([[Vito Antuofermo]] was the other) and the only one to do so while Hagler was the world champion.\n\nIn June 1984, Dur\u00e1n was stripped of his Light Middleweight title when the WBA did not approve of his fight with WBC Champion [[Thomas Hearns|Thomas \"Hitman\" Hearns]] and took away recognition of Dur\u00e1n as world champion the moment Dur\u00e1n stepped into the ring to box Hearns. Dur\u00e1n again made history in the fight, but this time it was the wrong kind. Hearns dropped Dur\u00e1n twice in the first round and as he rose to his feet after the second knockdown, which ended the round, the former champion did not know where his corner was. Hearns went on to knock Duran down a third time in the second round and the fight was stopped, marking the first time in his career that Dur\u00e1n had been knocked out in a fight (the \"No M\u00e1s\" fight was officially recorded as a technical knockout, because Duran quit). Dur\u00e1n then retired for a second time, but changed his mind over a year later, and was back fighting in early 1986.\n\nDur\u00e1n did not contend another title fight until 1989, but made the shot count when he won the WBC Middleweight title from [[Iran Barkley]] in February. The fight is considered one of Dur\u00e1n's greatest achievements, as the 37-year-old former lightweight champion took the middleweight crown, his fourth title. In a tough, back-and-forth fight, Dur\u00e1n knocked Barkley down in the eleventh round and Dur\u00e1n won a split decision (118\u2013112, 116\u2013112, 113\u2013116). The bout was named the 1989 \"Fight of the Year\" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''.\n\n=== Super middleweight ===\n{{main|Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Dur\u00e1n III}}\nDuran moved up to [[super middleweight]] for a third fight with [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in December 1989 (a fight dubbed ''Uno M\u00e1s'' \u2014 One More \u2014 by promoters), where Leonard's WBC super-middleweight title was on the line, although Leonard's camp insisted that the fight with Dur\u00e1n be at a 162lbs catchweight instead of the 168lbs super-middleweight limit that Dur\u00e1n favoured. In the end, both weighed in below the 160lbs middleweight limit. Dur\u00e1n was uncharacteristically flat for most of what was a strange fight. Although Leonard won the fight by a wide unanimous decision (120\u2013110, 119\u2013109, 116\u2013111), by the end of the fight Leonard looked the worse for wear as he had suffered several bad cuts. Leonard's lip was busted by a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required more than 60 stitches. Dur\u00e1n didn't fight again until 1991, so had given up his WBC middleweight crown that he had won against Barkley. Dur\u00e1n seemed to be in decline after the third fight against Leonard, but Dur\u00e1n persisted and worked his way into title shots for the lesser IBC super-middleweight and middleweight titles in 1994, 1995 and 1996.\n\nDur\u00e1n fought [[Vinny Pazienza]] twice, in June 1994 and January 1995, for the IBC Super Middleweight Championship, with Pazienza winning both times by unanimous decision. In the first fight, Dur\u00e1n put Pazienza down in Rounds 2 and 5, but referee Joe Cortez controversially ruled the Round 2 knockdown to be a slip. The first fight divided the people watching as some felt that Dur\u00e1n had won a close fight, but others felt that Pazienza had won either narrowly or widely after finishing strongly in the last five rounds. The second fight was more lopsided in Pazienza's favour, as despite the official judges giving Pazienza the win by scores of 116\u2013112, 117\u2013111 and 118\u2013110, the TV commentators expressed puzzlement at the closeness of the official scoring as they thought that Pazienza had won every round in a 120\u2013108 shutout.\n\nIn 1996, Dur\u00e1n fought [[H\u00e9ctor Camacho]] for the vacant IBC Middleweight Championship. At the end of the fight, fans and TV commentators seemed in complete agreement that Dur\u00e1n had won the fight in an excellent performance, but the three judges saw the fight very differently and awarded Camacho the victory by a very controversial unanimous decision. Dur\u00e1n's old rival, Sugar Ray Leonard, commentating at ringside, was baffled at the scoring and called it an early Christmas gift for Camacho, with the result motivating Leonard enough to come out of a 6-year boxing retirement to face Camacho himself in 1997. In 1997, Dur\u00e1n was defeated by former champion [[Jorge Castro (boxer)|Jorge Castro]] in Argentina. Dur\u00e1n then fought Castro in a rematch bout in Panama and won via unanimous decision, maintaining his unbeaten record in Panama.\n\nIn 1998, at the age of 47, he challenged 28-year-old WBA Middleweight Champion [[William Joppy]]. Joppy, a trim, quick-fisted fighter, battered Dur\u00e1n to defeat in just 3 rounds. It was Duran's most emphatic loss since the Hearns fight, over a decade earlier. Dur\u00e1n then announced his retirement for the third time in August 1998, but soon changed his mind and was back fighting in March 1999.\n\nIn June 2000, Dur\u00e1n avenged a previous loss to Pat Lawlor from 9 years before and won the NBA Super Middleweight Championship on his 49th birthday. He lost the title a year later to H\u00e9ctor Camacho in a rematch bout and in what would be Dur\u00e1n's final fight.\n\n== Retirement ==\n[[File:Roberto Duran signing autographs in Jan 2014.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Duran signs autographs at a Houston sports collectors show in January 2014.]][[File:Duran and Mosley.jpg|250px|thumb|Dur\u00e1n training [[Shane Mosley]] for his fight against [[David Avanesyan]], 2016]]\nIn October 2001, Dur\u00e1n traveled to [[Argentina]] to promote a [[salsa music]] CD that he had just released. While there, he was involved in a car crash and required life-saving surgery. After that incident, he announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 50.<ref name=\"retirement\">{{cite web | title=Roberto Duran quits boxing at 50 after car crash | work=usatoday.com | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/stories/2002-01-26-duran.htm |accessdate=January 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nAnnouncing his retirement, Dur\u00e1n cited the weight issues of his friend, Argentinian football legend [[Diego Maradona]], as motivation for getting back in shape, stating \"as of now, I am exercising so that when the [retirement] honors arrive the people will see me in shape. I don't want to [look] like Maradona did, all fat.\"<ref name=\"retirement\"/>\n\nDur\u00e1n's five world title belts, which he won in four different divisions, were stolen from his house in Panama in 1993 during a robbery allegedly staged by his brother-in-law, who gave them to memorabilia seller Luis Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez, who will stand trial for trying to sell stolen goods. Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez allegedly sold the belts to undercover [[FBI]] agents. He alleges that Dur\u00e1n authorized the sale of the five belts to him during a time that Dur\u00e1n was facing financial trouble. On September 23, 2003, a federal judge in [[Florida]] ordered the five belts returned to Dur\u00e1n.\n\nHis 70 wins by knockout place him in an exclusive group of boxers who have won 50 or more fights by knockout. He is ranked number 28 on ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'''s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.\n\nOn October 14, 2006, Dur\u00e1n was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Riverside, California,<ref>{{cite web | title=Duran inducted into World Boxing Hall of Fame | work=espn.com | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2626319 |accessdate=October 15, 2006}}</ref> and on June 10, 2007, into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in Canastota, New York.\n\nToday he is the brand ambassador of [[Panama Blue]], Panama's premium bottled water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prensa.com/impreso/rempresarial/2013-10-12|title=Rese\u00f1a Empresarial \u2013 La Prensa|work=La Prensa|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuran is a licensed ultralight aircraft pilot in Panama.
