He stated that much of the political dialogue in the US about the UN had been abdicated to its most strident critics, such as conservative talk-show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] and the [[Fox News]] cable channel and, as a result of this, the true role and value of the UN has become \"a mystery in Middle America\".<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/08/wun08.xml Alec Russell in ''The Telegraph'', \"US failing to aid the UN, says Annan's deputy\", 8 June 2006]</ref> These remarks resulted in a backlash from the White House and some US conservative commentators, culminating in a call for an apology by the US envoy to the United Nations [[John R.

These comments again drew criticism from some American officials, including the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], a spokesman from which stated \"We are seeing a troubling pattern of a high official of the UN who seems to be making it his business to criticize member states and, frankly, with misplaced and misguided criticisms.\"<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-08-02T231347Z_01_N02314381_RTRUKOC_0_US-MIDEAST-UN-MALLOCH.xml ''Reuters'', 2 August 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331061726/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews |date=31 March 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMalloch Brown responded in an interview with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]:\n:\"I don't think the US has anything to object to in the comments.
