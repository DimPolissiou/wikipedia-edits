Sewell also established himself as a leading critic of the [[Toronto Police]], demanding greater accountability to the public, and was a leading defender of [[gay rights]], endorsing gay rights activist [[George Hislop]]'s 1980 candidacy for [[city council]], at a time when it was rare for public figures to express support for same-sex rights.\n\nIn the [[1980 Toronto municipal election|1980 election]], after two years of controversy, pro-development Conservatives and Liberals united behind the candidacy of [[Art Eggleton]]. Although Sewell maintained the support of many [[Red Tory|Red Tories]], reform Liberals and [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] and won more votes and a larger share of the vote than in 1978, he lost the mayor's office to Eggleton.\n\n==Later life==\nSewell subsequently returned to city council as an [[alderman]] in a [[by-election]], to replace Ward 6 alderman [[Dan Heap]] who had been elected to parliament, and won re-election in 1982.

Sewell was an advisor to [[East London, South Africa|East London]], [[South Africa]]'s city council from 1994 to 1999 and as advisor on the re-establishment of local government in [[Malawi]] in 2000. Sewell also taught law, politics and social science at [[York University]] from 1989 to 1991.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Sewell founded the group Citizens for Local Democracy to fight the plans of the provincial [[Mike Harris]] government to abolish [[Metropolitan Toronto]] and amalgamate its constituent parts into a new City of Toronto \"[[merger (politics)#Canada|megacity]]\".\n\nIn the [[1999 Ontario general election|1999 Ontario provincial election]], Sewell ran as an independent candidate in the riding of [[Toronto Centre--Rosedale]], challenging [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[cabinet minister]] [[Al Leach]] to protest the megacity.  His entry into the race was controversial, with many activists accusing him of splitting the left-wing vote with the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP).  Sewell was also criticized for remaining in the race after Leach, whom he had personally targeted as the minister responsible for amalgamation, withdrew from the contest.  The riding was ultimately won by [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberal]] [[George Smitherman]]; Sewell finished third, behind Tory [[Durhane Wong-Rieger]].\n\nIn 2005, Sewell was made a member of the Order of Canada.

He also stated that he was disappointed at the record of Mayor [[David Miller (mayor of Toronto)|David Miller]]. \"Living in a megacity demands more citizen participation and community consultation, not less,\" says Sewell.

Sewell also established himself as a leading critic of the [[Toronto Police]], demanding greater accountability to the public, and was a leading defender of [[gay rights]], endorsing gay rights activist [[George Hislop]]'s 1980 candidacy for [[city council]], at a time when it was rare for public figures to express support for same-sex rights.\n\nIn the [[1980 Toronto municipal election|1980 election]], after two years of controversy, pro-development Conservatives and Liberals united behind the candidacy of [[Art Eggleton]]. Although Sewell maintained the support of many [[Red Tory|Red Tories]], reform Liberals and [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] and won more votes and a larger share of the vote than in 1978, he lost the mayor's office to Eggleton.\n\n==Later life==\nSewell subsequently returned to city council as an [[alderman]] in a [[by-election]], to replace Ward 6 alderman [[Dan Heap]] who had been elected to parliament, and won re-election in 1982.

Sewell also taught law, politics and social science at [[York University]] from 1989 to 1991.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Sewell founded the group Citizens for Local Democracy to fight the plans of the provincial [[Mike Harris]] government to abolish [[Metropolitan Toronto]] and amalgamate its constituent parts into a new City of Toronto \"[[merger (politics)#Canada|megacity]]\".\n\nIn the [[1999 Ontario general election|1999 Ontario provincial election]], Sewell ran as an independent candidate in the riding of [[Toronto Centre--Rosedale]], challenging [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[cabinet minister]] [[Al Leach]] to protest the megacity.  His entry into the race was controversial, with many activists accusing him of splitting the left-wing vote with the [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] (NDP).  Sewell was also criticized for remaining in the race after Leach, whom he had personally targeted as the minister responsible for amalgamation, withdrew from the contest.  The riding was ultimately won by [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberal]] [[George Smitherman]]; Sewell finished third, behind Tory [[Durhane Wong-Rieger]].\n\nIn 2005, Sewell was made a member of the Order of Canada.

Richards' guitar riff\u2014\u200cintended to be replaced by horns\u2014\u200copens and drives the song. The lyrics refer to [[sexual frustration]] and [[commercialism]].\n\nThe song was first released as a single in the United States in June 1965 and was also featured on the American version of the Rolling Stones' fourth studio album, ''[[Out of Our Heads]]'', released that July. \"Satisfaction\" was a hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the US. In the UK, the song initially was played only on [[Pirate radio|pirate radio stations]], because its lyrics were considered too sexually suggestive.<ref name=\"Nuzum\">{{cite book |last=Nuzum |first=Eric |title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-06-197673-5}}</ref> It later became the Rolling Stones' fourth number one in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" in the second spot on its list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\". The song was added to the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2006.\n\n==Recording==\nKeith Richards wrote \"Satisfaction\" in his sleep and recorded a rough version of the riff on a [[Philips]] cassette player.

In the mid-1980s, a true stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese editions of the CD reissue of ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]''. The stereo mix features a piano (played by session player [[Jack Nitzsche]], who also provides the song's iconic tambourine) and acoustic guitar that are barely audible in the original mono release (both instruments are also audible on a [[bootleg recording]] of the instrumental track). This stereo mix of \"Satisfaction\" also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but has not yet been featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese ''Hot Rocks'' CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of ''Hot Rocks'', an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano \"split\" left and right via a [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/stereostones/ |title=The Rolling Stones In Stereo |publisher=Lukpac.org |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics and melody==\n[[File:Satisfaction riff.png|thumb|left|450px|Guitar riff from \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"]]The song opens with the guitar riff, which is joined by the bass halfway through. It is repeated three times with the drums and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: \"I can't get no satisfaction\". The key is E major, but with the 3rd and 7th [[degree (music)|degree]] occasionally lowered, creating \u2013 in the first part of the verses (\"I can't get no ...\") \u2013 a distinctive mellow sound. The accompanying chords (i.e. E major, D major and A major) are [[Borrowed chord|borrowed]] from the E [[Mixolydian mode|mixolydian]] scale, which is often used in [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nThe title line is an example of a [[Double negative|negative concord]]. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the [[refrain|chorus]], where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation and confusion with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts \"useless information\" and a man on television tells him \"how white my shirts can be \u2013 but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me,\" a reference to the then ubiquitous [[Marlboro Man|Marlboro Cowboy]] style advertisement. Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any \"girl reaction\" was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they \"didn't understand the dirtiest line\", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is \"on a losing streak,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835889-2,00.html|url-access=limited|title=Going to Pot|date=1 July 1966|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time)]]|publisher=Time USA|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022141/http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C835889-2%2C00.html|archive-date=14 October 2007|url-status=live|access-date=18 December 2008|quote=But, gloats Jagger, \"They didn't understand the dirtiest line.\" That is the one where the girl pleads: \"Baby, better come back later next week 'cause you see I'm on a losing streak.\"}}</ref> an apparent reference to [[menstruation]].

In the mid-1980s, a true stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese editions of the CD reissue of ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]''. The stereo mix features a piano (played by session player [[Jack Nitzsche]], who also provides the song's iconic tambourine) and acoustic guitar that are barely audible in the original mono release (both instruments are also audible on a [[bootleg recording]] of the instrumental track). This stereo mix of \"Satisfaction\" also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but has not yet been featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese ''Hot Rocks'' CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of ''Hot Rocks'', an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano \"split\" left and right via a [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/stereostones/ |title=The Rolling Stones In Stereo |publisher=Lukpac.org |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics and melody==\n[[File:Satisfaction riff.png|thumb|left|450px|Guitar riff from \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"]]The song opens with the guitar riff, which is joined by the bass halfway through. It is repeated three times with the drums and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: \"I can't get no satisfaction\". The key is E major, but with the 3rd and 7th [[degree (music)|degree]] occasionally lowered, creating \u2013 in the first part of the verses (\"I can't get no ...\") \u2013 a distinctive mellow sound. The accompanying chords (i.e. E major, D major and A major) are [[Borrowed chord|borrowed]] from the E [[Mixolydian mode|mixolydian]] scale, which is often used in [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nThe title line is an example of a [[Double negative|negative concord]]. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the [[refrain|chorus]], where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation and confusion with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts \"useless information\" and a man on television tells him \"how white my shirts can be \u2013 but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me,\" a reference to the then ubiquitous [[Marlboro Man|Marlboro Cowboy]] style advertisement. Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any \"girl reaction\" was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they \"didn't understand the dirtiest line\", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is \"on a losing streak,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835889-2,00.html|url-access=limited|title=Going to Pot|date=1 July 1966|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time)]]|publisher=Time USA|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022141/http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C835889-2%2C00.html|archive-date=14 October 2007|url-status=live|access-date=18 December 2008|quote=But, gloats Jagger, \"They didn't understand the dirtiest line.\" That is the one where the girl pleads: \"Baby, better come back later next week 'cause you see I'm on a losing streak.\"}}</ref> an apparent reference to [[menstruation]].

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]]. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from [[the Football League]] for the first time, an embarrassment as the team had competed continuously in [[the Football League]] since 1900.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe earliest form of Pitmiddle's name was ''Petmeodhel'' (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated {{convert|0.5|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} north of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]] in the centre of the parish, Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/>\n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving it of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the [[19th century]], the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched with reeds from the Tay. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref> On an [[Ordnance Survey]] map of 1861, a \"mill dam\" is shown southeast of the settlement, towards today's Guardswell Farm.<ref>[https://i0.wp.com/holeousia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pitmiddle-village-1861.jpg?ssl=1 Ordnance Survey map, 1861]</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

These less common phonemes are shown in brackets.<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIneke Wellens gives the following orthography for Nubi where it differs from the IPA symbols: /{{IPA|\u0283}}/ = sh; /t{{IPA|\u0283}}/ = ch; /{{IPA|d\u0292}}/ = j; /{{IPA|\u0272}}/ = ny; /w/ = w or u; /j/ = y or i; /{{IPA|\u03b8}}/ = th; /{{IPA|\u00f0}}/ = dh; /x/ = kh; /{{IPA|\u0127}}/ = \u1e25.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Syllable Structure ====\n[[Syllable|Syllables]] typically have a CV, VC, V or CVC structure with VC only occurring in initial syllables. Final and initial CC occur only in a few specific examples such as ''\"skul\"'' which means ''\"school\"'' or ''\"sems\"'' which means ''\"sun\"''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] can change the meaning of words for example ''\"saba\"'' means ''\"seven\"'' or ''\"morning\"'' depending on whether the stress is on the first or second syllables respectively. Vowels are often omitted in unstressed, final syllables and sometime even the stressed final ''\"u\"'' in the passive form may be deleted after ''\"m\", \"n\", \"l\", \"f\"'' or ''\"b\".'' This can caused syllables to be realigned even across words.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Nominals ===\n[[Noun|Nouns]] are [[Inflection|inflected]] by [[Grammatical number|number]] only (taking a singular or plural form) although for most nouns this does not represent a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] change. Jonathan Owens gives 5 broad [[Inflection|inflectional categories]] of nouns:<ref name=\":0\" />\n# Nouns which undergo a stress shift when the plural is formed.\n# Nouns which undergo [[apophony]].\n# Nouns which take a suffix and undergo a stress shift in the plural form.\n# Nouns which form the plural by [[suppletion]]\n# [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Loanword|loan-words]] which take different prefixes in the singular and plural forms\nThe table below shows examples of each type of pluralisation. The apostrophe has been placed before the stressed syllable:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Type of \nPluralisation\n!Singular Form\n!Plural Form\n!English Translation\n|-\n|1\n|yo'wele\n|yowe'le\n|boy(s)\n|-\n|2\n|ke'bir\n|ku'bar\n|big [thing(s)]\n|-\n|3\n|'tajir\n|taji'rin\n|rich person(s)\n|-\n|3\n|'seder\n|sede'ra\n|tree(s)\n|-\n|4\n|'marya\n|nus'wan\n|woman / women<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n|5\n|muze\n|waze\n|old man / old men\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>''\"Nuswan\"'' may be supplemented by a suffix as if it were type 3, thus, ''\"nuswana\"'' could also mean ''\"women\".''<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Adjective|Adjectives]] follow the noun and some adjectives have singular and plural forms which must agree with the noun. Adjectives may also take the prefixes ''\"al\", \"ali\", \"ab\"'' or ''\"abu\"'' which mark them as [[Habitual aspect|habitual]]. When a noun is a possessor follow the possessed noun and is mark with the particle ''\"ta\"'' which is placed between the two nouns. The particle can be omitted in what are called inalienable possessed nouns where it is clear that the latter possesses the former.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bimbashi Arabic]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Bernd Heine]] (1982) ''The Nubi Language of Kibera \u2013 an Arabic Creole''.

Vowels are not distinguished by length except in at least two exceptions from Kenyan Nubi (which are not present in Ugandan dialects) where ''\"bara\"'' means ''\"outside\"'' and is an adverb while ''\"baara\"'' means ''\"the outside\"'' and is a noun, and also where ''\"saara\"'' meaning ''\"bewitch\"'' is compared to ''\"sara\"'' meaning ''\"herd, cattle\".'' Despite this, there is a tendency for vowels in stressed syllables to be registered as long vowels.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

The a [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] version of the /r/ sound may also occur and some dialects use /l/ in its place. [[Gemination|Geminates]] are very unusual in Nubi. These less common phonemes are shown in brackets.<ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIneke Wellens gives the following orthography for Nubi where it differs from the IPA symbols: /{{IPA|\u0283}}/ = sh; /t{{IPA|\u0283}}/ = ch; /{{IPA|d\u0292}}/ = j; /{{IPA|\u0272}}/ = ny; /w/ = w or u; /j/ = y or i; /{{IPA|\u03b8}}/ = th; /{{IPA|\u00f0}}/ = dh; /x/ = kh; /{{IPA|\u0127}}/ = \u1e25.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Syllable Structure ====\n[[Syllable|Syllables]] typically have a CV, VC, V or CVC structure with VC only occurring in initial syllables. Final and initial CC occur only in a few specific examples such as ''\"skul\"'' which means ''\"school\"'' or ''\"sems\"'' which means ''\"sun\"''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] can change the meaning of words for example ''\"saba\"'' means ''\"seven\"'' or ''\"morning\"'' depending on whether the stress is on the first or second syllables respectively. Vowels are often omitted in unstressed, final syllables and sometime even the stressed final ''\"u\"'' in the passive form may be deleted after ''\"m\", \"n\", \"l\", \"f\"'' or ''\"b\".'' This can caused syllables to be realigned even across words.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Nominals ===\n[[Noun|Nouns]] are [[Inflection|inflected]] by [[Grammatical number|number]] only (taking a singular or plural form) although for most nouns this does not represent a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] change. Jonathan Owens gives 5 broad [[Inflection|inflectional categories]] of nouns:<ref name=\":0\" />\n# Nouns which undergo a stress shift when the plural is formed.\n# Nouns which undergo [[apophony]].\n# Nouns which take a suffix and undergo a stress shift in the plural form.\n# Nouns which form the plural by [[suppletion]]\n# [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Loanword|loan-words]] which take different prefixes in the singular and plural forms\nThe table below shows examples of each type of pluralisation. The apostrophe has been placed before the stressed syllable:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Type of \nPluralisation\n!Singular Form\n!Plural Form\n!English Translation\n|-\n|1\n|yo'wele\n|yowe'le\n|boy(s)\n|-\n|2\n|ke'bir\n|ku'bar\n|big [thing(s)]\n|-\n|3\n|'tajir\n|taji'rin\n|rich person(s)\n|-\n|3\n|'seder\n|sede'ra\n|tree(s)\n|-\n|4\n|'marya\n|nus'wan\n|woman / women<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n|5\n|muze\n|waze\n|old man / old men\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>''\"Nuswan\"'' may be supplemented by a suffix as if it were type 3, thus, ''\"nuswana\"'' could also mean ''\"women\".''<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[Adjective|Adjectives]] follow the noun and some adjectives have singular and plural forms which must agree with the noun. Adjectives may also take the prefixes ''\"al\", \"ali\", \"ab\"'' or ''\"abu\"'' which mark them as [[Habitual aspect|habitual]]. When a noun is a possessor follow the possessed noun and is mark with the particle ''\"ta\"'' which is placed between the two nouns. The particle can be omitted in what are called inalienable possessed nouns where it is clear that the latter possesses the former.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bimbashi Arabic]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Bernd Heine]] (1982) ''The Nubi Language of Kibera \u2013 an Arabic Creole''.
