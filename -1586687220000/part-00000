Instead, they preferred the term \"[[flag officer]]\", in order to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. During the American Civil War, the US Congress honored [[David Glasgow Farragut]]'s successful assault on the city of New Orleans by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard both had a temporary one-star rank of commodore that was used in limited circumstances. By the end of the war, all incumbents had been advanced to the rank of two-star rear admiral and the commodore rank was eliminated in both services. Both the Navy and the Coast Guard divided their rear admirals into \"lower half\" and full rear admirals, or \"upper half\", the former being paid at the same rate as a one-star brigadier general in the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and the newly independent [[U.S. Air Force]]. Lower-half rear admirals were eventually promoted to full rear admirals, or upper half status, where they would receive pay equivalent to a two-star major general.  However, both categories of rear admiral wore two-star insignia, an issue that was a source of consternation to the other services.\n\nAt the same time, the Navy also bestowed the title of commodore on selected U.S. Navy captains who commanded multiple subordinate units, such as destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons and air wings and air groups not designated as carrier air wings or carrier air groups.  Although not [[flag officer]]s, these officers were entitled to a personal blue and white command pennant containing the initials, acronym abbreviation or numerical designation of their command.<ref>[http://www.google.com/imgres?q=commodore+pennant&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1440&bih=795&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=bSGywyKi1FYoFM:&imgrefurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/cmdpen.html&docid=nH6cBkqGfKw3UM&imgurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/usbrdcp.GIF&w=279&h=216&ei=WZGEUKOgJoq08ATvlYDYBQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=624&vpy=311&dur=494&hovh=172&hovw=223&tx=71&ty=80&sig=116125559521526739827&page=1&tbnh=142&tbnw=184&start=0&ndsp=24&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:92 Google Image Search]</ref>\n \nIn 1981, {{USPL|97|86}} expanded commodore from a title to an official permanent grade by creating the one-star rank of [[commodore admiral]].<ref name=\"rear admiral\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5501- 10 U.S.C. 5501 Notes]</ref> After only 11 months, the rank was reverted to just commodore but kept the one-star insignia.  However, this caused issues with the Navy due to the difficulty in discriminating those commodores who were flag officers from commodores who were senior captains in certain command positions. Then in 1985, {{USPL|99|145}} renamed commodore to the current grade of rear admiral (lower half) effective on November 8, 1985.<ref name=\"rear admiral\"/> \n\nUp until 1981 all rear admirals wore two stars on their shoulder bars and rank insignia. Since then, rear admirals (lower half) wear one star while rear admirals wear two; verbal address remains \"rear admiral\" for both ranks. On correspondence, where the rear admiral's rank is spelled out, the acronym (LH) and (UH) follows the rear admiral's rank title to distinguish between one and two stars.\n\nBeginning around 2001, the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps started using the separate rank abbreviations RDML (one star) and RADM (two stars), while the Public Health Service continued to use the abbreviation RADM for both.<ref>[http://www.usphs.gov/aboutus/uniforms.aspx About the Commissioned Corps Uniforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175033/http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nAs flag officers, the flags flown for rear admirals of the unrestricted line of the U.S. Navy have one or two white, single-point-up stars on blue fields for the lower half or upper half, respectively. The flags of restricted line officers and staff corps officers have blue stars on a white field. All services officially list the two-star grade as rear admiral and not rear admiral (upper half) as stated by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|8111}} and  {{UnitedStatesCode|37|201}} of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]]. However, the four uniformed services will sometimes list the rank as rear admiral (upper half) to help the general public distinguish between the two grades.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=266 Navy.mil Rank Insignia of Navy Commissioned and Warrant Officers]</ref>\n\n== United States Maritime Service ==\nAlthough it exists largely as a maritime training organization, the United States Maritime Service does use the ranks of rear admiral (upper half) and rear admiral (lower half).  By law, the Service has the same rank structure of the United States Coast Guard, but its uniforms are more similar to the United States Navy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 46 USC Subtitle V: Merchant Marine|url = http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title46/subtitle5&edition=prelim|website = uscode.house.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory limits ==\n\nU.S. Code of law explicitly limits the total number of flag officers that may be on active duty at any given time.

Some of these slots are reserved or set by statute. For example, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy is a two-star rear admiral in the Navy.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149- 10 U.S.C. 5149.

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once confirmed, a nominee is promoted once he or she assumes an office that requires or allows an officer to hold that rank. For one-star or two-star positions of office that are reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For the Navy and the Coast Guard, because the one-star and two-star grades are permanent ranks, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board to add their input on the nominee before the nomination can be sent to the Senate for approval. For the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one-star and two-star rank are achieved by appointment from the President, or from their department secretary,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 206] - Assignment of officers</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/207 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 - Grades], ranks, and titles of commissioned corps</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3028 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 3028] - Positions of importance and responsibility</ref> and do not require senatorial approval.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.679: The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 strikes \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" for all officer appointments]</ref> \n\nThe standard tour length for most rear admiral positions is three years, but some are set at four or more years by statute.

Instead, they preferred the term \"[[flag officer]]\", in order to distinguish the rank from the traditions of the European navies. During the American Civil War, the US Congress honored [[David Glasgow Farragut]]'s successful assault on the city of New Orleans by creating the rank of rear admiral on July 16, 1862.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard both had a temporary one-star rank of commodore that was used in limited circumstances. By the end of the war, all incumbents had been advanced to the rank of two-star rear admiral and the commodore rank was eliminated in both services. Both the Navy and the Coast Guard divided their rear admirals into \"lower half\" and full rear admirals, or \"upper half\", the former being paid at the same rate as a one-star brigadier general in the [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]] and the newly independent [[U.S. Air Force]]. Lower-half rear admirals were eventually promoted to full rear admirals, or upper half status, where they would receive pay equivalent to a two-star major general.  However, both categories of rear admiral wore two-star insignia, an issue that was a source of consternation to the other services.\n\nAt the same time, the Navy also bestowed the title of commodore on selected U.S. Navy captains who commanded multiple subordinate units, such as destroyer squadrons, submarine squadrons and air wings and air groups not designated as carrier air wings or carrier air groups.  Although not [[flag officer]]s, these officers were entitled to a personal blue and white command pennant containing the initials, acronym abbreviation or numerical designation of their command.<ref>[http://www.google.com/imgres?q=commodore+pennant&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1440&bih=795&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=bSGywyKi1FYoFM:&imgrefurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/cmdpen.html&docid=nH6cBkqGfKw3UM&imgurl=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/personal/usbrdcp.GIF&w=279&h=216&ei=WZGEUKOgJoq08ATvlYDYBQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=624&vpy=311&dur=494&hovh=172&hovw=223&tx=71&ty=80&sig=116125559521526739827&page=1&tbnh=142&tbnw=184&start=0&ndsp=24&ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0,i:92 Google Image Search]</ref>\n \nIn 1981, {{USPL|97|86}} expanded commodore from a title to an official permanent grade by creating the one-star rank of [[commodore admiral]].<ref name=\"rear admiral\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5501- 10 U.S.C. 5501 Notes]</ref> After only 11 months, the rank was reverted to just commodore but kept the one-star insignia.  However, this caused issues with the Navy due to the difficulty in discriminating those commodores who were flag officers from commodores who were senior captains in certain command positions. Then in 1985, {{USPL|99|145}} renamed commodore to the current grade of rear admiral (lower half) effective on November 8, 1985.<ref name=\"rear admiral\"/> \n\nUp until 1981 all rear admirals wore two stars on their shoulder bars and rank insignia. Since then, rear admirals (lower half) wear one star while rear admirals wear two; verbal address remains \"rear admiral\" for both ranks. On correspondence, where the rear admiral's rank is spelled out, the acronym (LH) and (UH) follows the rear admiral's rank title to distinguish between one and two stars.\n\nBeginning around 2001, the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps started using the separate rank abbreviations RDML (one star) and RADM (two stars), while the Public Health Service continued to use the abbreviation RADM for both.<ref>[http://www.usphs.gov/aboutus/uniforms.aspx About the Commissioned Corps Uniforms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513175033/http://www.usphs.gov/AboutUs/uniforms.aspx |date=2008-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nAs flag officers, the flags flown for rear admirals of the unrestricted line of the U.S. Navy have one or two white, single-point-up stars on blue fields for the lower half or upper half, respectively. The flags of restricted line officers and staff corps officers have blue stars on a white field. All services officially list the two-star grade as rear admiral and not rear admiral (upper half) as stated by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|8111}} and  {{UnitedStatesCode|37|201}} of the [[United States Code|U.S. Code of law]]. However, the four uniformed services will sometimes list the rank as rear admiral (upper half) to help the general public distinguish between the two grades.<ref>[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/navy_legacy_hr.asp?id=266 Navy.mil Rank Insignia of Navy Commissioned and Warrant Officers]</ref>\n\n== United States Maritime Service ==\nAlthough it exists largely as a maritime training organization, the United States Maritime Service does use the ranks of rear admiral (upper half) and rear admiral (lower half).  By law, the Service has the same rank structure of the United States Coast Guard, but its uniforms are more similar to the United States Navy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 46 USC Subtitle V: Merchant Marine|url = http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title46/subtitle5&edition=prelim|website = uscode.house.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory limits ==\n\nU.S. Code of law explicitly limits the total number of flag officers that may be on active duty at any given time. The total number of active duty flag officers is capped at 162 for the Regular Navy,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/526- 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 526.

Some of these slots are reserved or set by statute. For example, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy is a two-star rear admiral in the Navy.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5149- 10 U.S.C. 5149.

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] must then confirm the nominee by a majority vote before the officer can be promoted. Once confirmed, a nominee is promoted once he or she assumes an office that requires or allows an officer to hold that rank. For one-star or two-star positions of office that are reserved by statute, the President nominates an officer for appointment to fill that position. For the Navy and the Coast Guard, because the one-star and two-star grades are permanent ranks, the nominee may still be screened by an in-service promotion board to add their input on the nominee before the nomination can be sent to the Senate for approval. For the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, one-star and two-star rank are achieved by appointment from the President, or from their department secretary,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 206] - Assignment of officers</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/207 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 - Grades], ranks, and titles of commissioned corps</ref><ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/3028 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 3028] - Positions of importance and responsibility</ref> and do not require senatorial approval.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.679: The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 strikes \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\" for all officer appointments]</ref> \n\nThe standard tour length for most rear admiral positions is three years, but some are set at four or more years by statute. For the Navy, Coast Guard, and NOAA Corps, both grades of rear admiral are permanent ranks and do not expire when the officer vacates a one-star or two-star position. The Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, however, employs permanent promotions in both grades of rear admiral as well as position-linked temporary appointments in both grades.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/206 42 U.S.C. 206(c)] Assignment of officers - Creation of temporary positions as Assistant Surgeons General</ref> Their temporary ranks expires when those officers vacate certain temporary positions of office designated to bear those ranks.\n\n== Tradition ==\nBy tradition in the United States Navy, when an officer is selected or appointed to flag rank, all current Navy flag officers write the selectee a letter congratulating him or her for attaining flag officer status.<ref>[http://downloads.feedroom.com/downloads/t_assets/pentagontv/20081030/MullenReal_oct29_Web_output_1_2YMQ.wmv The Pentagon Channel.mil: 28 Oct 2008 - Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, speech at Maxwell Gunter AFB, (69 minutes 37 seconds into the speech).
