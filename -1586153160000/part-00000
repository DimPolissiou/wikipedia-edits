From the beginning, similarities between Benoit and Billington were apparent, as Benoit adopted many of his moves such as the [[Diving head butt|diving headbutt]] and the [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]; the homage was complete with his initial billing as \"Dynamite\" Chris Benoit. According to Benoit, in his first match, he attempted the diving headbutt before learning how to land correctly, and had the wind knocked out of him; he said he would never do the move again at that point. His debut match was a tag team match on November 22, 1985 in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], where he teamed with \"The Remarkable\" Rick Patterson against Butch Moffat and Mike Hammer, which Benoit's team won the match after Benoit pinned Moffat with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]].<ref name=\"archive\"/> The first title Benoit ever won was the [[Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship]] on March 18, 1988 against [[Gadowar Singh Sahota|Gama Singh]].<ref name=\"stampede\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/ab/stampede/ab-bc-mh.html |title=Stampede Wrestling British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Title |publisher=wrestling-titles.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref> During his tenure in Stampede, he won four International Tag Team and three more British Commonwealth titles,<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |edition=4th |year=2006 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> and had a lengthy [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[John Hindley|Johnny Smith]] that lasted for over a year, which both men traded back-and-forth the British Commonwealth title. In 1989, Stampede closed its doors later that year, and with a recommendation from [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]], Benoit departed for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1986\u20131994) ===\nUpon arriving in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Benoit spent about a year training in their \"New Japan Dojo\" with the younger wrestlers to improve his abilities. While in the dojo, he spent months doing strenuous activities like push ups and floor sweeping before stepping into the ring. He made his Japanese debut in 1986 under his real name. In 1989, he started wearing a mask and assuming the [[Ring name|name]] The Pegasus Kid. Benoit said numerous times that he originally hated the mask, but it eventually became a part of him. While with NJPW, he came into his own as a performer in critically acclaimed matches with luminaries like [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Shinjiro Otani]], [[Eddie Guerrero|Black Tiger]], and [[El Samurai]] in their junior heavyweight division.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn August 1990, he won his first major championship, the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]], from Jushin Thunder Liger. He eventually lost the title in November 1990 (and in July 1991 in Japan and in November 1991 in Mexico, his [[Luchas de Apuestas|mask]]) back to Liger,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> forcing him to reinvent himself as Wild Pegasus. Benoit spent the next couple years in Japan, winning the [[Best of the Super Juniors]] tournament twice in [[Best of the Super Juniors#1993|1993]] and [[Best of the Super Juniors#1995|1995]]. He went on to win the [[Super J-Cup (1994)|inaugural]] [[Super J-Cup|Super J-Cup tournament]] in 1994, defeating Black Tiger, [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]], and [[The Great Sasuke]] in the finals. He wrestled outside New Japan occasionally to compete in Mexico and Europe, where he won a few regional championships, including the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]]. He held that title for over a year, having many forty-plus minute matches with [[Villano III]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling (1992\u20131993) ===\nBenoit first came to [[World Championship Wrestling]] in June 1992, teaming up with fellow Canadian wrestler [[Biff Wellington]] for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] tournament; they were defeated by [[Brian Pillman]] and Jushin Thunder Liger in the first round at [[Clash of the Champions XIX]].\n\nHe did not return to WCW until January 1993 at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]'', defeating [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]. A month later, at [[SuperBrawl III]], he lost to [[2 Cold Scorpio]], getting pinned with only three seconds left in the 20-minute time limit. At the same time, he formed a tag team with [[Bobby Eaton]]. After he and Eaton lost to Scorpio and [[Marcus Bagwell]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]], Benoit headed back to Japan.\n\n=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131995) ===\nIn 1994, Benoit began working with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in between tours of Japan. He was booked as a dominant wrestler there, gaining notoriety as the \"Crippler\" after he put [[Rocco Rock]] out. In August 1994, Benoit competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott E.

From that point until his departure from ECW, he was known as \"Crippler Benoit\". When he returned to WCW in October 1995, WCW modified his ring name to \"Canadian Crippler Chris Benoit\". In ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'' book, Heyman commented that he planned on using Benoit as a dominant heel for quite some time, before putting the company's main title, the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]], on him to be the long-term champion of the company.\n\nBenoit and [[Dean Malenko]] won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] from Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]] in February 1995, Benoit's first American title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> After winning, they were initiated into the [[The Triple Threat|Triple Threat]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], led by ECW World Heavyweight Champion, [[Shane Douglas]], as Douglas's attempt to recreate the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], as the three-man contingency held all three of the ECW championships at the time (Malenko also held the [[ECW World Television Championship]] at the time). The team lost the championship to [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]] that April at ECW Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with [[The Steiner Brothers]] and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed to make it on time, so Benoit left as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States. He toured Japan until WCW called.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n=== Return to WCW ===\n====The Four Horsemen (1995&ndash;1999)====\n[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) had a working relationship, and because of their \"talent exchange\" program, Benoit signed with WCW in late 1995 along with a number of talent working in New Japan to be a part of the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]]. Like the majority of those who came to WCW in the exchange, he started out in as a member of the [[cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division, having lengthy matches against many of his former rivals in Japan on almost every single broadcast. At the end of 1995, Benoit went back to Japan as a part of the \"talent exchange\" to wrestle as a representative for New Japan in the [[Super J-Cup#1995|Super J-Cup: 2nd Stage]], defeating [[Chris Jericho|Lionheart]] in the quarterfinals (he received a bye to the quarterfinals for his work in 1995, similar to the way he advanced in the 1994 edition) and losing to [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]] in the semifinals.\n\n[[File:Lisa and Chris Benoit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Benoit with a fan during his time in WCW]]\nAfter impressing higher-ups with his work, he was approached by [[Ric Flair]] and the WCW booking staff to become a member of the reformed [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] in 1995, alongside Flair, [[Arn Anderson]], and [[Brian Pillman]]; he was introduced by Pillman as a gruff, no-nonsense heel similar to his ECW persona, \"The Crippler\". He was brought in to add a new dynamic for Anderson and Flair's tormenting of [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] in their \"Alliance to End Hulkamania\", which saw the Horsemen team up with [[The Dungeon of Doom]], but that alliance ended with Dungeon leader and WCW [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] feuding with Pillman. When Pillman abruptly left the company for the WWF, Benoit was placed into his ongoing feud with Sullivan. This came to fruition through a dissension between the two in a tag team match with the two reluctantly teaming with each other against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]], and Benoit being attacked by Sullivan at [[Slamboree 1996|Slamboree]]. This led to the two having violent confrontations at [[pay-per-view]]s, which led to Sullivan booking a feud in which Benoit was having an [[affair]] with Sullivan's real life wife and [[Kayfabe|onscreen]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#V|valet]], [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy]] (also known as Woman). Benoit and Nancy were forced to spend time together to make the affair look real, (hold hands in public, share hotel rooms, etc.).<ref>[http://www.metafilter.com/62384/Chris-Benoit-19672007 Chris Benoit (1967\u20132007) profile], MetaFilter.com; accessed June 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nThis onscreen relationship developed into a real-life affair offscreen. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best. Benoit did, however, admit having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD ''[[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]]'' that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. This continued for over the course of a year with Sullivan having his [[enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcers]] apprehend Benoit in a multitude of matches. This culminated in a [[retirement match]] at the [[Bash at the Beach 1997|Bash at the Beach]], where Benoit defeated Sullivan; this was used to explain Sullivan going to a behind-the-scenes role, where he could focus on his initial job of booking.\n\nIn 1998, Benoit had a long feud with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. They fought over the [[WCW World Television Championship]] until Booker lost the title to [[Dave Finlay|Fit Finlay]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> Booker won a \"Best-of-Seven\" series which was held between the two to determine a number one contender. Benoit went up 3 to 1 before Booker caught up, forcing the 7th and final match on [[WCW Monday Nitro|''Monday Nitro'']]. During the match, [[Bret Hart]] interjected himself, interfering on behalf of Benoit in an attempt to get him to join the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Benoit refused to win that way and told the referee what happened, getting himself disqualified. Booker refused that victory, instead opting for an eighth match at the [[Great American Bash 1998|Great American Bash]] to see who would fight Finlay later that night. Booker won the final match and went on to beat Finlay for the title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This feud significantly elevated both men's careers as singles competitors, and both remained at the top of the midcard afterward.\n\nIn 1999, Benoit teamed with Dean Malenko once again and defeated [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Barry Windham]] to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This led to a reformation of the Four Horsemen with the tag team champions, Anderson, and [[Steve McMichael|Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael]]. The two hunted after the tag team championship for several months, feuding with teams like [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] and [[Perry Saturn]] or [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] \n\n====The Revolution and World Heavyweight Champion (1999&ndash;2000)====\nAfter a falling out with Anderson and McMichael, Benoit and Malenko left the Horsemen; he won the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]]<ref name=\"Titles\"/> before bringing together Malenko, Perry Saturn, and [[Shane Douglas]] to form \"[[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]]\".\n\nThe Revolution was a heel stable of younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never gave them the chance to be stars, [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] older, more established wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable worthiness of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit's heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from [[Jeff Jarrett]] in a [[ladder match]]. In October 1999 on ''Nitro'' in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to [[Owen Hart]], who had recently died due to an [[Over the Edge (1999)#Owen Hart accident|equipment malfunction]]. Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, [[Harley Race]].\n\nBenoit was unhappy working for WCW.<ref name=\"unhappy\">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/apr17_ring.html |title=Ring of intrigue in WWF shows |last=Cole |first=Glenn |date=April 17, 1999 |work=SLAM!

After losing their \"tryout matches\" upon entry, The Radicalz aligned themselves with WWF Champion [[Triple H]] and became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Faction|faction]]. Benoit quickly won his first title in the WWF just over a month later at [[WrestleMania 2000]], pinning [[Chris Jericho]] in a triple threat match to win [[Kurt Angle]]'s [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. It was also in this time period that Benoit wrestled in his first WWF pay-per-view main events, challenging [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]] in July and as part of a fatal four way title match at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]] in September. On both occasions Benoit appeared to have won the title, only to have the decision reversed by then-WWF [[Professional wrestling authority figures|commissioner]] [[Mick Foley]] due to cheating on Benoit's part. Benoit simultaneously entered into a long-running feud with Jericho for the Intercontinental title, with the two meeting at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]] and [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]]; Benoit winning all three matches. The feud finally culminated in Jericho defeating Benoit in a [[ladder match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001. Benoit won the Intercontinental title three times between April 2000 and January 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn early 2001, Benoit broke away from The Radicalz (who had recently reformed three months earlier) and turned face, feuding first with his former stablemates and then with Kurt Angle, whom he wrestled and lost to at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001/wwf040101 |title=WrestleMania X-Seven report |accessdate=February 9, 2008 |publisher=The Other Arena |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404173136/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001%2Fwwf040101 |archivedate=April 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=}}</ref> He gained some amount of revenge after beating Angle in a \"Ultimiate Submission\" match at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]]. The feud continued after Benoit stole Angle's cherished [[Gold medal|Olympic Gold Medal]]. This culminated in a match at [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]] where Angle won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] with the help of [[Edge and Christian]]. In response, Benoit teamed up with his former rival Jericho to defeat Edge and Christian in that night's [[professional wrestling tag team match types#Tag Team Turmoil|Tag Team Turmoil match]].\n\nThe next night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', Benoit and Jericho defeated [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Triple H for their title. The pair used the win as a springboard to challenge Austin for his WWF Championship. Benoit got two title matches the following week, first losing in a manner similar to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] in Calgary and then losing in a close match in Benoit's hometown of Edmonton. However, Benoit suffered a neck injury in a four-way [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]] that required surgery with [[Lloyd Youngblood|Dr. Lloyd Youngblood]]. Despite this, he continued to wrestle until the [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], where he was pinned in a triple threat match versus Austin and Jericho.

From the beginning, similarities between Benoit and Billington were apparent, as Benoit adopted many of his moves such as the [[Diving head butt|diving headbutt]] and the [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]; the homage was complete with his initial billing as \"Dynamite\" Chris Benoit. According to Benoit, in his first match, he attempted the diving headbutt before learning how to land correctly, and had the wind knocked out of him; he said he would never do the move again at that point. His debut match was a tag team match on November 22, 1985 in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], where he teamed with \"The Remarkable\" Rick Patterson against Butch Moffat and Mike Hammer, which Benoit's team won the match after Benoit pinned Moffat with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Sunset flip|sunset flip]].<ref name=\"archive\"/> The first title Benoit ever won was the [[Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship]] on March 18, 1988 against [[Gadowar Singh Sahota|Gama Singh]].<ref name=\"stampede\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/ab/stampede/ab-bc-mh.html |title=Stampede Wrestling British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Title |publisher=wrestling-titles.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref> During his tenure in Stampede, he won four International Tag Team and three more British Commonwealth titles,<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book |author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will |title=Wrestling Title Histories |publisher=Archeus Communications |edition=4th |year=2006 |isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}</ref> and had a lengthy [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[John Hindley|Johnny Smith]] that lasted for over a year, which both men traded back-and-forth the British Commonwealth title. In 1989, Stampede closed its doors later that year, and with a recommendation from [[Allen Coage|Bad News Allen]], Benoit departed for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1986\u20131994) ===\nUpon arriving in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Benoit spent about a year training in their \"New Japan Dojo\" with the younger wrestlers to improve his abilities. While in the dojo, he spent months doing strenuous activities like push ups and floor sweeping before stepping into the ring. He made his Japanese debut in 1986 under his real name. In 1989, he started wearing a mask and assuming the [[Ring name|name]] The Pegasus Kid. Benoit said numerous times that he originally hated the mask, but it eventually became a part of him. While with NJPW, he came into his own as a performer in critically acclaimed matches with luminaries like [[Jushin Thunder Liger]], [[Shinjiro Otani]], [[Eddie Guerrero|Black Tiger]], and [[El Samurai]] in their junior heavyweight division.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn August 1990, he won his first major championship, the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]], from Jushin Thunder Liger. He eventually lost the title in November 1990 (and in July 1991 in Japan and in November 1991 in Mexico, his [[Luchas de Apuestas|mask]]) back to Liger,<ref name=\"Titles\"/> forcing him to reinvent himself as Wild Pegasus. Benoit spent the next couple years in Japan, winning the [[Best of the Super Juniors]] tournament twice in [[Best of the Super Juniors#1993|1993]] and [[Best of the Super Juniors#1995|1995]]. He went on to win the [[Super J-Cup (1994)|inaugural]] [[Super J-Cup|Super J-Cup tournament]] in 1994, defeating Black Tiger, [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]], and [[The Great Sasuke]] in the finals. He wrestled outside New Japan occasionally to compete in Mexico and Europe, where he won a few regional championships, including the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]]. He held that title for over a year, having many forty-plus minute matches with [[Villano III]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling (1992\u20131993) ===\nBenoit first came to [[World Championship Wrestling]] in June 1992, teaming up with fellow Canadian wrestler [[Biff Wellington]] for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] tournament; they were defeated by [[Brian Pillman]] and Jushin Thunder Liger in the first round at [[Clash of the Champions XIX]].\n\nHe did not return to WCW until January 1993 at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]'', defeating [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]. A month later, at [[SuperBrawl III]], he lost to [[2 Cold Scorpio]], getting pinned with only three seconds left in the 20-minute time limit. At the same time, he formed a tag team with [[Bobby Eaton]]. After he and Eaton lost to Scorpio and [[Marcus Bagwell]] at [[Slamboree (1993)|Slamboree]], Benoit headed back to Japan.\n\n=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131995) ===\nIn 1994, Benoit began working with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in between tours of Japan. He was booked as a dominant wrestler there, gaining notoriety as the \"Crippler\" after he put [[Rocco Rock]] out. In August 1994, Benoit competed in a [[NWA World Title Tournament|one-night eight-man tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"Williams2013\">{{cite book |author=Scott E.

The injury came when Benoit threw Sabu with the intention that he take a face-first \"pancake\" [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bump]], but Sabu attempted to turn mid-air and take a backdrop bump instead. He did not achieve full rotation and landed almost directly on his neck.<ref name=\"hell162163\">{{cite book |title=Ring of Hell: The Story of Chris Benoit & The Fall of the Pro Wrestling Industry |last=Randazzo V |first=Matthew |publisher=Phoenix Books |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ringofhellstoryo0000rand/page/162 162\u2013163] |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-59777-622-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/ringofhellstoryo0000rand/page/162}}</ref>\n\nAfter this match Benoit returned to the locker room and broke down over the possibility that he might have paralysed someone.<ref name=\"hell162163\"/> [[Paul Heyman]], the head booker of ECW at the time, came up with the idea of continuing the \"Crippler\" moniker for Benoit. From that point until his departure from ECW, he was known as \"Crippler Benoit\". When he returned to WCW in October 1995, WCW modified his ring name to \"Canadian Crippler Chris Benoit\". In ''The Rise and Fall of ECW'' book, Heyman commented that he planned on using Benoit as a dominant heel for quite some time, before putting the company's main title, the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]], on him to be the long-term champion of the company.\n\nBenoit and [[Dean Malenko]] won the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] from Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]] in February 1995, Benoit's first American title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> After winning, they were initiated into the [[The Triple Threat|Triple Threat]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], led by ECW World Heavyweight Champion, [[Shane Douglas]], as Douglas's attempt to recreate the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]], as the three-man contingency held all three of the ECW championships at the time (Malenko also held the [[ECW World Television Championship]] at the time). The team lost the championship to [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]] that April at ECW Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with [[The Steiner Brothers]] and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed to make it on time, so Benoit left as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States. He toured Japan until WCW called.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n=== Return to WCW ===\n====The Four Horsemen (1995&ndash;1999)====\n[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) had a working relationship, and because of their \"talent exchange\" program, Benoit signed with WCW in late 1995 along with a number of talent working in New Japan to be a part of the [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]]. Like the majority of those who came to WCW in the exchange, he started out in as a member of the [[cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division, having lengthy matches against many of his former rivals in Japan on almost every single broadcast. At the end of 1995, Benoit went back to Japan as a part of the \"talent exchange\" to wrestle as a representative for New Japan in the [[Super J-Cup#1995|Super J-Cup: 2nd Stage]], defeating [[Chris Jericho|Lionheart]] in the quarterfinals (he received a bye to the quarterfinals for his work in 1995, similar to the way he advanced in the 1994 edition) and losing to [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]] in the semifinals.\n\n[[File:Lisa and Chris Benoit.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Benoit with a fan during his time in WCW]]\nAfter impressing higher-ups with his work, he was approached by [[Ric Flair]] and the WCW booking staff to become a member of the reformed [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] in 1995, alongside Flair, [[Arn Anderson]], and [[Brian Pillman]]; he was introduced by Pillman as a gruff, no-nonsense heel similar to his ECW persona, \"The Crippler\". He was brought in to add a new dynamic for Anderson and Flair's tormenting of [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]] in their \"Alliance to End Hulkamania\", which saw the Horsemen team up with [[The Dungeon of Doom]], but that alliance ended with Dungeon leader and WCW [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] feuding with Pillman. When Pillman abruptly left the company for the WWF, Benoit was placed into his ongoing feud with Sullivan. This came to fruition through a dissension between the two in a tag team match with the two reluctantly teaming with each other against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]], and Benoit being attacked by Sullivan at [[Slamboree 1996|Slamboree]]. This led to the two having violent confrontations at [[pay-per-view]]s, which led to Sullivan booking a feud in which Benoit was having an [[affair]] with Sullivan's real life wife and [[Kayfabe|onscreen]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#V|valet]], [[Nancy Benoit|Nancy]] (also known as Woman). Benoit and Nancy were forced to spend time together to make the affair look real, (hold hands in public, share hotel rooms, etc.).<ref>[http://www.metafilter.com/62384/Chris-Benoit-19672007 Chris Benoit (1967\u20132007) profile], MetaFilter.com; accessed June 30, 2015.</ref>\n\nThis onscreen relationship developed into a real-life affair offscreen. As a result, Sullivan and Benoit had a contentious backstage relationship at best. Benoit did, however, admit having a certain amount of respect for Sullivan, saying on the DVD ''[[Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story]]'' that Sullivan never took undue liberties in the ring during their feud, even though he blamed Benoit for breaking up his marriage. This continued for over the course of a year with Sullivan having his [[enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcers]] apprehend Benoit in a multitude of matches. This culminated in a [[retirement match]] at the [[Bash at the Beach 1997|Bash at the Beach]], where Benoit defeated Sullivan; this was used to explain Sullivan going to a behind-the-scenes role, where he could focus on his initial job of booking.\n\nIn 1998, Benoit had a long feud with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. They fought over the [[WCW World Television Championship]] until Booker lost the title to [[Dave Finlay|Fit Finlay]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> Booker won a \"Best-of-Seven\" series which was held between the two to determine a number one contender. Benoit went up 3 to 1 before Booker caught up, forcing the 7th and final match on [[WCW Monday Nitro|''Monday Nitro'']]. During the match, [[Bret Hart]] interjected himself, interfering on behalf of Benoit in an attempt to get him to join the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Benoit refused to win that way and told the referee what happened, getting himself disqualified. Booker refused that victory, instead opting for an eighth match at the [[Great American Bash 1998|Great American Bash]] to see who would fight Finlay later that night. Booker won the final match and went on to beat Finlay for the title.<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This feud significantly elevated both men's careers as singles competitors, and both remained at the top of the midcard afterward.\n\nIn 1999, Benoit teamed with Dean Malenko once again and defeated [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Barry Windham]] to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=\"Titles\"/> This led to a reformation of the Four Horsemen with the tag team champions, Anderson, and [[Steve McMichael|Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael]]. The two hunted after the tag team championship for several months, feuding with teams like [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] and [[Perry Saturn]] or [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] \n\n====The Revolution and World Heavyweight Champion (1999&ndash;2000)====\nAfter a falling out with Anderson and McMichael, Benoit and Malenko left the Horsemen; he won the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]]<ref name=\"Titles\"/> before bringing together Malenko, Perry Saturn, and [[Shane Douglas]] to form \"[[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]]\".\n\nThe Revolution was a heel stable of younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never gave them the chance to be stars, [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] older, more established wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable worthiness of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit's heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from [[Jeff Jarrett]] in a [[ladder match]]. In October 1999 on ''Nitro'' in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to [[Owen Hart]], who had recently died due to an [[Over the Edge (1999)#Owen Hart accident|equipment malfunction]]. Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, [[Harley Race]].\n\nBenoit was unhappy working for WCW.<ref name=\"unhappy\">{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingArchive/apr17_ring.html |title=Ring of intrigue in WWF shows |last=Cole |first=Glenn |date=April 17, 1999 |work=SLAM!

After losing their \"tryout matches\" upon entry, The Radicalz aligned themselves with WWF Champion [[Triple H]] and became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Faction|faction]]. Benoit quickly won his first title in the WWF just over a month later at [[WrestleMania 2000]], pinning [[Chris Jericho]] in a triple threat match to win [[Kurt Angle]]'s [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. It was also in this time period that Benoit wrestled in his first WWF pay-per-view main events, challenging [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]] in July and as part of a fatal four way title match at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]] in September. On both occasions Benoit appeared to have won the title, only to have the decision reversed by then-WWF [[Professional wrestling authority figures|commissioner]] [[Mick Foley]] due to cheating on Benoit's part. Benoit simultaneously entered into a long-running feud with Jericho for the Intercontinental title, with the two meeting at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], [[Judgment Day (2000)|Judgment Day]] and [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]]; Benoit winning all three matches. The feud finally culminated in Jericho defeating Benoit in a [[ladder match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001. Benoit won the Intercontinental title three times between April 2000 and January 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn early 2001, Benoit broke away from The Radicalz (who had recently reformed three months earlier) and turned face, feuding first with his former stablemates and then with Kurt Angle, whom he wrestled and lost to at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001/wwf040101 |title=WrestleMania X-Seven report |accessdate=February 9, 2008 |publisher=The Other Arena |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404173136/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?2001%2Fwwf040101 |archivedate=April 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=}}</ref> He gained some amount of revenge after beating Angle in a \"Ultimiate Submission\" match at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]]. The feud continued after Benoit stole Angle's cherished [[Gold medal|Olympic Gold Medal]]. This culminated in a match at [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]] where Angle won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|two out of three falls match]] with the help of [[Edge and Christian]]. In response, Benoit teamed up with his former rival Jericho to defeat Edge and Christian in that night's [[professional wrestling tag team match types#Tag Team Turmoil|Tag Team Turmoil match]].\n\nThe next night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', Benoit and Jericho defeated [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Triple H for their title. The pair used the win as a springboard to challenge Austin for his WWF Championship. Benoit got two title matches the following week, first losing in a manner similar to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] in Calgary and then losing in a close match in Benoit's hometown of Edmonton. However, Benoit suffered a neck injury in a four-way [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|TLC match]] that required surgery with [[Lloyd Youngblood|Dr. Lloyd Youngblood]]. Despite this, he continued to wrestle until the [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], where he was pinned in a triple threat match versus Austin and Jericho.

Angered, Jehovah exiles Adam, Eve, Lilith and Lucifer; Lilith brings Lucifer with her, and they make a new garden and have six children.<ref name=\"milspaw variations\"/><ref name=\"dark mother circle 1\">{{cite book |author1=[[Phil Brucato|Brucato, Phil]] |author2=Udell, Rachell |title=Revelations of the Dark Mother |publisher=[[White Wolf Publishing]] |chapter=First Circle: The Book of the Serpent |pages=28\u201365 |year=1998 |isbn=1-56504-237-9}}</ref>\n* \"Second Circle: The Book of the Owl\" is a retelling of some of the events from \"First Circle\" from Lilith's perspective, and recounts her meeting with Caine, taking him in to her and Lucifer's garden, and teaching him to grow through suffering.

Milspaw and Wesley K. Evans, in their article \"Variations on Vampires\" in ''[[Western Folklore]]'', called the poem \"powerful\", and found the addition of Lilith, a feminine divine, to the [[Book of Genesis]]-based vampire mythology \"elegant\" and adding depth, with Lilith and Caine used as opposites to Adam and Abel across multiple axes: Lilith the wife versus Adam the husband, and Caine and Abel the brothers; and Lilith the stepmother versus Caine the stepson, and Adam the father versus Abel the son. They saw them as analogies for opposing life styles, and as adding oppositions of magical-versus-mundane, darkness-versus-light, and wilderness-versus-garden.<ref name=\"milspaw variations\"/> Bassingthwaite called Lilith's story fresh, mature and sophisticated, and appreciated the voice given to her, describing her portrayal as that of a \"strong, independent, magickal woman\".<ref name=\"sfsite review\"/> ''Backstab'' called the book graphic, poetic, and inspired, giving ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' more depth, and thought that readers interested in alternate views of the ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' world and in interpreting and discovering what is revealed in the poem would love it.<ref name=\"backstab review\"/>\n\nBassingthwaite praised the book's design and layout, comparing it favorably to ''The Book of Nod'': he found Guay's artwork beautiful, and conveying a Lilith that is \"variously powerful, afflicted, sorrowful, loving, and avenging\"; Locke's artwork successfully setting off the foreword with its portrayal of Dolium; and the pictograms interesting and organic.<ref name=\"sfsite review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sfsite.com/05b/rev57.htm |title=Revelations of the Dark Mother |author=Bassingthwaite, Don |date=1999 |website=[[SF Site]] |access-date=2020-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412131435/https://www.sfsite.com/05b/rev57.htm |archive-date=2016-04-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> Backstab, too, liked Guay's illustration work, calling it \"superb\".<ref name=\"backstab review\">{{cite magazine |last=Poste |first=Timbre |date=March\u2013April 1999 |title=Revelations of the Dark Mother |language=French |magazine=Backstab |issue=14 |pages=42\u201344 |publisher=FC Publications}}\n</ref>\n\nDiscussing ''Revelations of the Dark Mother'' in the context of a supplement to the ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' tabletop game, French magazine ''[[Casus Belli (magazine)|Casus Belli]]'' said that it, like ''The Book of Nod'', would be of interest to those who find the game's occult-esoteric background fascinating, and appreciated its unexpected comedic elements, but thought that the way it only targets big fans of ''World of Darkness'', and the lack of a French translation, could make it hard to use when playing ''Vampire: The Masquerade''.<ref name=\"cb 117\">{{cite magazine |date=December 1998 |title=White Wolf |language=French |magazine=[[Casus Belli (magazine)|Casus Belli]] |issue=117 |page=15 |publisher=Excelsior Publications}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=February\u2013March 1999 |title=White Wolf |language=French |magazine=[[Casus Belli (magazine)|Casus Belli]] |issue=118 |page=80 |publisher=Excelsior Publications}}</ref> Bassingthwaite thought that the poem would be most useful in a game dealing with themes of mysticism, conspiracies and end-times, with the section \"The Rising Tides\"'s prophecy of Lilith's return; he also saw it as useful for ''World of Darkness'' games outside of ''Vampire: The Masquerade'', particularly ''[[Mage: The Ascension]]'', ''[[Vampire: The Dark Ages]]'', and dark games of ''[[Changeling: The Dreaming]]''.<ref name=\"sfsite review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{World of Darkness}}\n[[Category:1998 poetry books]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Adam and Eve]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Cain and Abel]]\n[[Category:Epic poems in English]]\n[[Category:Lilith]]\n[[Category:Lucifer]]\n[[Category:Vampire: The Masquerade]]\n[[Category:Vampires in written fiction]]\n[[Category:World of Darkness novels]]\n", "name_user": "Alexandra IDV", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSummary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelations_of_the_Dark_Mother"}

Throughout the 20th Century, more than half of the population was involved in agrarian activities and rural life, with numerous small towns and villages spread across the country.\n\nThe traditional way of life based on back-breaking toil and skills passed on through the generations to provide for food and necessities was changing. An increased demand for commodities resulted in the adoption of mechanization, the assembly line and mass production. As industries began to compete with agriculture, more of a reliance on factories and cities began to change the Canadian landscape.\n\nCanada is rich in natural resources with an abundance of raw materials necessary for industrial development. Minerals such as asbestos, iron, uranium, nickel, copper, gold and zinc were available for both export and domestic use. With the availability of vast reservoirs of water to create [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric power]] and the \"black gold\" of coal mines, basic metals can be produced, such as aluminum.\n\nWhen war came to Canada in the 1940s, massive engineering and manufacturing centres were created to produce the weapons of war from detonator caps to four-engined bombers. Industrial production was greatly increased with the addition of many new mines and smelters in the most northerly regions of the Canadian Shield, with new communities built around them.\n\nBuilding on the industrial progress of wartime, in a postwar world, Canadian factories and manufacturing plants were able to pivot to new products and industries, such as the design of commercial and military aircraft, creating atomic power plants and introducing \"electronic\" brains to business applications. New discoveries of oil in the Canadian prairies led to the development of a [[petrochemical industry]]. Technological advances led to an industrial sector able to handle all aspects of production of many \"made in Canada\" products.\n\nAlthough production and export of commodities such as pulp and paper are still essential to a strong economy, Canadian industry is able to diversify to produce a multitude of domestic items such as pots and pans, washing machines, television sets and bicycles. Far from the industrial centres, new communities have grown up in the suburbs. With industrial development, life in Canada continues to change with a steadily growing prosperity and workers benefitting with more security, shorter hours and a safer, more pleasant workplace.\n\n==Production==\n''Industrial Canada'' was  part of the NFB's ''Canada Carries On'' series of documentary short films for [[CBC Television]].
