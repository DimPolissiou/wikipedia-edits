Alvin Ailey Jr., was an African-American dancer, director, [[choreographer]], and [[activist]] who founded the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] (AAADT), one of the most successful dance companies in the world. He created AAADT and its affiliated Ailey School as havens for nurturing black artists and expressing the universality of the African-American experience through dance. His work fused theatre, modern dance, ballet, and jazz with black vernacular, creating hope-fueled choreography that continues to spread global awareness of black life in America.

The company had its debut at the [[92nd Street Y]]. The performance included Ailey's first masterpiece, ''Blues Suite'', which followed men and women as they caroused and cavorted over the course of an evening while blues music played in the background until church bells began to ring, signalling a return to mundane life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/arts/review-dance-three-suites-and-a-solo-in-the-ailey-tradition.html|title=Review/Dance; Three Suites and a Solo In the Ailey Tradition|last=Anderson|first=Jack|date=1989-12-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1912037|title=Alvin Ailey's Dance Troupe at 45|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref> Two years later he premiered his most popular and critically acclaimed work, ''[[Revelations (Alvin Ailey)|Revelations]]'', again at the 92nd Street Y. In creating ''Revelations'' Ailey drew upon his \"blood memories\" of growing up in Texas surrounded by Black people, the church, spirituals, and the blues.

Though the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] sponsored AAADT's first international tour in 1962, which traveled across Asia\u2014with followups to Senegal in 1966 and East & West Africa in 1967\u2014the company was able to book only a few performances per season in America. After a successful week-long engagement at the Billy Rose Theatre, the company was invited to become the resident company at Brooklyn Academy of Music. The relationship did not go well and ended a few years later.\n\nIn 1970, with few bookings on the radar\u2014and on the eve of a tour to Russia as part of a cultural exchange agreement\u2014Ailey announced at a press conference that he was closing the company. In response, the State Department sponsored an Ailey tour of North Africa to tide things over. That August, the company toured to Russia where it was ecstatically received. Their performances were broadcast on Moscow television and seen by over 22 million viewers. On closing night, because the Russian audiences would not stop applauding, the company gave over 30 curtain calls. Returning home with news of this triumph, the company performed a two-week engagement at the [[ANTA Theatre|ANTA Theater]]. By the end of January 1971 performance, the entire run was sold out. After 13 years, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre was a monumental success. In August 1972 the company was briefly renamed Alvin Ailey City Center Dance Theater and became a resident company of [[New York City Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/alvin-ailey-arsonist-modern-dance-is-getting-hot-then-in-april-of.html|title=Modern dance is getting hot|last=Cohn|first=Ellen|date=1973-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThough Ailey's work has been met with popular and critical acclaim, there have been detractors of his theatrical style.

They are as honest and truthful as we can make them. I'm interested in putting something on stage that will have a very wide appeal without being condescending; that will reach an audience and make it part of the dance; that will get everybody into the theater. If it's art and entertainment\u2014thank God, that's what I want to be.\"\n\nWhile Ailey choreographed more than 70 ballets for his dancers, he insisted that the company perform pieces by other choreographers rather than stand as a singular vehicle for his voice. In present-day the company continues this ethos by presenting major revivals and commissioning pieces from a wide range of choreographers. The company's repertoire contains over 200 ballets.\n\nThough AAADT was formed to celebrate African American culture and to provide performances for black dancers, who were frequently denied opportunities due to racist mores of the time, Ailey proudly employed artists based solely on artistic talent and integrity, regardless of their background.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newnownext.com/lgbt-black-history-month/01/2016/|title=9 LGBT People Of Color Who Changed History|work=LOGO News|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> In addition to his work as artistic director and choreographer with AADT, Ailey also choreographed ballets for other companies including American Ballet Theatre,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/arts/dance/29wilson.html|title=Sallie Wilson, 76, Dramatic Ballerina Famed for Antony Tudor Roles|last=Anderson|first=Jack|date=2008-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Joffrey Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/arts/the-dance-3-works-by-ailey.html|title=The Dance: 3 Works by Ailey|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=1986-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and The Metropolitan Opera.

Their aim was to provide access to arts and dance to under-resourced communities. They started off in Brooklyn with 125 students. A year later the school relocated to Manhattan behind the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]'s complex. In 1984, [[Denise Jefferson]] assumed directorship. Under her leadership, the school developed a Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in partnership with Fordham University in 1998. The school was renamed The Ailey School in 1999. Several years later, the school moved into The Joan Weill Center for Dance. Following Jefferson's death in 2010, [[Tracy Inman]] and [[Melanie Person]] assumed stewardship of the school as co-directors of the school. In 2012, after leading Ailey 2 for 38 years, [[Sylvia Waters]] retired. The second company's resident choreographer and associate director [[Troy Powell]] took over her role as artistic director. With the addition of the Elaine Wynn and Family Education Wing, the Ailey school is still growing and is now the largest place in New York City committed to training dancers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaileyschool.edu/history-philosophy|title=History & Philosophy|date=2016-03-02|work=The Ailey School|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAiley loathed the label \"black choreographer\" and preferred being known simply as a choreographer.

Alvin Ailey Jr., was an African-American dancer, director, [[choreographer]], and [[activist]] who founded the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]], one of the most successful dance companies in the world. He created AAADT and its affiliated Ailey School as havens for nurturing black artists and expressing the universality of the African-American experience through dance. His work fused theatre, modern dance, ballet, and jazz with black vernacular, creating hope-fueled choreography that continues to spread global awareness of black life in America.

The company had its debut at the [[92nd Street Y]].

Though the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] sponsored AAADT's first international tour in 1962, which traveled across Asia\u2014with followups to Senegal in 1966 and East & West Africa in 1967\u2014the company was able to book only a few performances per season in America. After a successful week-long engagement at the Billy Rose Theatre, the company was invited to become the resident company at Brooklyn Academy of Music. The relationship did not go well and ended a few years later.\n\nIn 1970, with few bookings on the radar\u2014and on the eve of a tour to Russia as part of a cultural exchange agreement\u2014Ailey announced at a press conference that he was closing the company. In response, the State Department sponsored an Ailey tour of North Africa to tide things over. That August, the company toured to Russia where it was ecstatically received. Their performances were broadcast on Moscow television and seen by over 22 million viewers. On closing night, because the Russian audiences would not stop applauding, the company gave over 30 curtain calls. Returning home with news of this triumph, the company performed a two-week engagement at the [[ANTA Theatre|ANTA Theater]]. By the end of January 1971 performance, the entire run was sold out. After 13 years, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre was a monumental success. In August 1972 the company was briefly renamed Alvin Ailey City Center Dance Theater and became a resident company of [[New York City Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/04/29/archives/alvin-ailey-arsonist-modern-dance-is-getting-hot-then-in-april-of.html|title=Modern dance is getting hot|last=Cohn|first=Ellen|date=1973-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nThough Ailey's work has been met with popular and critical acclaim, there have been detractors of his theatrical style.

They are as honest and truthful as we can make them. I'm interested in putting something on stage that will have a very wide appeal without being condescending; that will reach an audience and make it part of the dance; that will get everybody into the theater. If it's art and entertainment\u2014thank God, that's what I want to be.\"\n\nWhile Ailey choreographed more than 70 ballets for his dancers, he insisted that the company perform pieces by other choreographers rather than stand as a singular vehicle for his voice. In present-day the company continues this ethos by presenting major revivals and commissioning pieces from a wide range of choreographers. The company's repertoire contains over 200 ballets.\n\nThough AAADT was formed to celebrate African American culture and to provide performances for black dancers, who were frequently denied opportunities due to racist mores of the time, Ailey proudly employed artists based solely on artistic talent and integrity, regardless of their background.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.newnownext.com/lgbt-black-history-month/01/2016/|title=9 LGBT People Of Color Who Changed History|work=LOGO News|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> In addition to his work as artistic director and choreographer with AADT, Ailey also choreographed ballets for other companies including American Ballet Theatre,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/arts/dance/29wilson.html|title=Sallie Wilson, 76, Dramatic Ballerina Famed for Antony Tudor Roles|last=Anderson|first=Jack|date=2008-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Joffrey Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/arts/the-dance-3-works-by-ailey.html|title=The Dance: 3 Works by Ailey|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=1986-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and The Metropolitan Opera.

Their aim was to provide access to arts and dance to under-resourced communities. They started off in Brooklyn with 125 students. A year later the school relocated to Manhattan behind the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]'s complex. In 1984, [[Denise Jefferson]] assumed directorship. Under her leadership, the school developed a Bachelor of Fine Arts Program in partnership with Fordham University in 1998. The school was renamed The Ailey School in 1999. Several years later, the school moved into The Joan Weill Center for Dance. Following Jefferson's death in 2010, [[Tracy Inman]] and [[Melanie Person]] assumed stewardship of the school as co-directors of the school. In 2012, after leading Ailey 2 for 38 years, [[Sylvia Waters]] retired. The second company's resident choreographer and associate director [[Troy Powell]] took over her role as artistic director. With the addition of the Elaine Wynn and Family Education Wing, the Ailey school is still growing and is now the largest place in New York City committed to training dancers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaileyschool.edu/history-philosophy|title=History & Philosophy|date=2016-03-02|work=The Ailey School|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAiley loathed the label \"black choreographer\" and preferred being known simply as a choreographer.

India was facing competition on the world market not just from China, but also from other countries entering the business.\n\nIn 1983, Tata Tea bought the stake belonging to the [[James Finlay Bangladesh|James Finlay]] group to form the individual entity Tata Tea. In the same year, the company decided to move from the commodities business to consumer branding. The first brand Tata Tea was introduced. This was followed by other brands like [[Kannan Devan Hills Plantation|Kannan Devan]], Agni, Gemini and Chakra Gold. In spite of being the largest market in the world, the concept of branded tea took time to be accepted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn 1987, Tata Tea set up a fully owned subsidiary, Tata Tea Inc., in United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/company/tata-global-557/information/company-history|title=Tata Global Beverages Ltd.|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>\n\n===1990 to 2000===\nIn the 1990s, Tata Tea decided to take its brands into the global markets. It formed an export joint venture with [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s Tetley Tea in 1992. Other new enterprises included a majority interest in Consolidated Coffee Ltd. (Tata Coffee Ltd.) and a joint venture to manage agricultural estates in Sri Lanka. Tata Tea Inc. in United States processed and marketed instant tea from its facility in [[Florida]], based on sourcing of instant tea products out of [[Munnar]] and [[Kerala]]. In 1993, they entered into a joint venture with Allied Lyons PLC in UK to form Estate Tata Tetley.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Tata Tea attempted to buy Tetley and the Lankan JVC acquired 51% shareholding in Watawala Plantations Ltd.\n\nIn 1997 the company was embroiled in a major scandal known as the \"[[Tata Tapes controversy]]\" which related to funds the company provided to the outlawed [[United Liberation Front of Assam]] (ULFA), an armed-struggle group operating in [[Assam]].\n\nBy 1999, Tata Tea's brands had a combined market share of 25% in India.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The company had 74 tea gardens and was producing 6.2 [[crore]] kilograms of tea a year, two thirds of it packaged and branded. Towards the end of the year, the tea business was hit by a drought in much of India. In addition, Russia, once the largest buyer of Indian tea, temporarily withdrew from the market.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\n[[File:Tata and tetley.jpg|thumb|right|Tetley tea canister from Canada]]\nAn important step for Tata Tea was the acquisition of the Tetley Group (based in United Kingdom) in 2000. It was a \u00a3271 million ($432 million) leveraged buyout. Tata Tea reportedly outbid the American conglomerate [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] in what was described as the largest takeover of a foreign company by an Indian one to date. At the time, Tetley was the world's second-largest tea company after [[Unilever]]'s [[Brooke Bond]]-[[Lipton]] and had an annual turnover of \u00a3300 million. It was the market leader in Britain and Canada and a popular brand in United States, [[Australia]] and the [[Middle East]].\n\nEstablished in 1837, Tetley was the first [[United Kingdom|British]] tea company to introduce the tea bag to UK in 1953. The tea bag was followed by the first round tea bag in 1989 and the 'no drip, no mess' [[drawstring]] bag in 1997. Tetley now contributes for around two thirds of the total turnover of Tata Tea.\n\nFrom 2005, Tata Tea began a restructuring exercise to divest direct ownership of plantations in India, a process facilitated by subsidised loans from the World Bank's [[International Finance Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBOM1064820070219 |title=UPDATE 1-Tata Tea sells stake in new plantation firm to IFC |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Tata Tea acquired [[Eight O'Clock Coffee]], a U.S.-based coffee producer from Gryphon Investors for $220m;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2006-06-26/news/27465216_1_tata-coffee-gryphon-investors-folgers-and-maxwell-house|title=Tatas buy Eight O'Clock Coffee|work=The Economic Times|date=26 June 2006}}</ref> before being sold to Gryphon, the Eight O'Clock Coffee brand was originally owned by [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company]] from its beginnings in 1859 to 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Tata Tea launched the campaign [[Jaago Re!]] to awaken youth to social issues. The campaign was extended into 2008.

In the same year, the company decided to move from the commodities business to consumer branding. The first brand Tata Tea was introduced. This was followed by other brands like [[Kannan Devan Hills Plantation|Kannan Devan]], Agni, Gemini and Chakra Gold. In spite of being the largest market in the world, the concept of branded tea took time to be accepted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn 1987, Tata Tea set up a fully owned subsidiary, Tata Tea Inc., in United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/company/tata-global-557/information/company-history|title=Tata Global Beverages Ltd.|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>\n\n===1990 to 2000===\nIn the 1990s, Tata Tea decided to take its brands into the global markets. It formed an export joint venture with [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s Tetley Tea in 1992. Other new enterprises included a majority interest in Consolidated Coffee Ltd. (Tata Coffee Ltd.) and a joint venture to manage agricultural estates in Sri Lanka. Tata Tea Inc. in United States processed and marketed instant tea from its facility in [[Florida]], based on sourcing of instant tea products out of [[Munnar]] and [[Kerala]]. In 1993, they entered into a joint venture with Allied Lyons PLC in UK to form Estate Tata Tetley.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Tata Tea attempted to buy Tetley and the Lankan JVC acquired 51% shareholding in Watawala Plantations Ltd.\n\nIn 1997 the company was embroiled in a major scandal known as the \"[[Tata Tapes controversy]]\" which related to funds the company provided to the outlawed [[United Liberation Front of Assam]] (ULFA), an armed-struggle group operating in [[Assam]].\n\nBy 1999, Tata Tea's brands had a combined market share of 25% in India.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The company had 74 tea gardens and was producing 6.2 [[crore]] kilograms of tea a year, two thirds of it packaged and branded. Towards the end of the year, the tea business was hit by a drought in much of India. In addition, Russia, once the largest buyer of Indian tea, temporarily withdrew from the market.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\n[[File:Tata and tetley.jpg|thumb|right|Tetley tea canister from Canada]]\nAn important step for Tata Tea was the acquisition of the Tetley Group (based in United Kingdom) in 2000. It was a \u00a3271 million ($432 million) leveraged buyout. Tata Tea reportedly outbid the American conglomerate [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] in what was described as the largest takeover of a foreign company by an Indian one to date. At the time, Tetley was the world's second-largest tea company after [[Unilever]]'s [[Brooke Bond]]-[[Lipton]] and had an annual turnover of \u00a3300 million. It was the market leader in Britain and Canada and a popular brand in United States, [[Australia]] and the [[Middle East]].\n\nEstablished in 1837, Tetley was the first [[United Kingdom|British]] tea company to introduce the tea bag to UK in 1953. The tea bag was followed by the first round tea bag in 1989 and the 'no drip, no mess' [[drawstring]] bag in 1997. Tetley now contributes for around two thirds of the total turnover of Tata Tea.\n\nFrom 2005, Tata Tea began a restructuring exercise to divest direct ownership of plantations in India, a process facilitated by subsidised loans from the World Bank's [[International Finance Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBOM1064820070219 |title=UPDATE 1-Tata Tea sells stake in new plantation firm to IFC |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Tata Tea acquired [[Eight O'Clock Coffee]], a U.S.-based coffee producer from Gryphon Investors for $220m;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2006-06-26/news/27465216_1_tata-coffee-gryphon-investors-folgers-and-maxwell-house|title=Tatas buy Eight O'Clock Coffee|work=The Economic Times|date=26 June 2006}}</ref> before being sold to Gryphon, the Eight O'Clock Coffee brand was originally owned by [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company]] from its beginnings in 1859 to 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Tata Tea launched the campaign [[Jaago Re!]] to awaken youth to social issues.
