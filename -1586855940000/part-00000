The industry generally considers Dutchman [[Adam Wybe]] to have built the first operational system in 1644. The technology, which was further developed by the people living in the Alpine regions of Europe, progressed and expanded with the advent of wire rope and electric drive.<ref name=csm />\n\nThe first use of [[wire rope]] for aerial tramways is disputed. American inventor [[Peter Cooper]] is one early claimant, constructing an aerial tramway using wire rope in [[Baltimore]] 1832, to move [[landfill]] materials. Though there is only partial evidence for the claimed 1832 tramway, Cooper was involved in many of such tramways built in the 1850s, and in 1853 he built a two-mile-long tramway to transport [[iron ore]] to his [[blast furnace]]s at [[Ringwood, New Jersey]].<ref name=highwire>{{cite book |title=Riding the Hire Wire |last=Trennert |first=Robert A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sW9AwAAQBAJ |date=2001 |publisher=University Press of Colorado|isbn=9781457109850 }}</ref>\n\nWorld War I motivated extensive use of military tramways for warfare between Italy and Austria.<ref name=\"csm\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mines.edu/library/ropeway/about_ropeways.html |title=About Ropeways |publisher=Colorado School of Mines \u2013 Arthur Lakes Library |author=Information Center for Ropeway Studies |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2006-11-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904183704/http://www.mines.edu/library/ropeway/about_ropeways.html |archivedate=2006-09-04}}</ref>\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, new forms of cable-hauled transportation systems were created including the use of steel cable to allow for greater load support and larger systems.

Loaded wagons at the top of the incline are lowered down, their weight hauling empty wagons from the bottom. The winding drum has a [[brake]] to control the rate of travel of the wagons.

The patriotic monarchy was replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] based on the principle of rule by Islamic jurists, (or \"''[[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|Velayat-e faqih]]''\"), where clerics serve as [[head of state]] and in many powerful governmental roles.  A pro-[[Western culture|Western]], pro-[[United States|American]] foreign policy was exchanged for one of \"neither east nor west\", said to rest on the three \"pillars\" of mandatory veil (''[[hijab]]'') for women, and opposition to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].<ref>[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf Reading Khamenei by Karmin Sadjadpour ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027090356/https://carnegieendowment.org/files/sadjadpour_iran_final2.pdf |date=2019-10-27 }} p.14</ref> A rapidly modernizing capitalist economy<ref>[\"Modern Iran: roots and results of revolution\", p.133, 227</ref><ref>''Iran : The Illusion of Power'' by Robert Graham, p.18, 19, 20, 83</ref> was replaced by a [[populism|populist]] and [[Islam]]ic economy and culture.\n\nThe leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic, [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], was Iran's [[supreme leader]] until his death in 1989.<ref name = \"Britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215140348/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-32981 |date=2007-12-15 }}.</ref> He was followed by [[Ali Khamenei]].\n\n==General trends==\nDuring the era of the Islamic Republic, Iran has grown from 39 million (1980) to 81.16 million (2017) people.\n\nSome things remain much as they were under the monarchy. Iran has retained its status as a major regional power\u2014it is far larger than any of its gulf neighbors, and possesses large reserves of gas and oil.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\">Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.194</ref> Its national cohesion brought by a long history as a nation, strong central state government and its oil export revenues have brought it \"respectable\" levels of income, literacy, college enrollment, infant mortality, and infrastructure.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\" /> Modern trends found under the monarchy, such as urbanization, growing enrollment in higher education<ref>which went from 155,000 in 1977 to 135,700 in 1982 (when universities reopened after cultural revolution) to a peak of 1,048,000 in 1995. from UNESCO Division of Statistics, quoted in Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.188</ref> and literacy, continued.\n\n===Politics and government===\n{{Main|Politics and Government of Iran}}\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is an Islamic [[theocracy]] headed by a [[Supreme Leader]]. Its  [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was approved in 1979 and amended in 1989. [[Twelvers|Jaafari]] ([[Usuli]]) school of thought is the official religion.  It has an elected president and elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 18 on up may vote, which are supervised by theocratic bodies, particularly the [[Council of Guardians]] which had veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law. Nonetheless the elected organs have more power than equivalent ones in the Shah's government.\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main|Iran's foreign policy}}\nFollowing the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|revolution]] in Iran, the Islamic revolutionary regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] dramatically reversed the pro-Western foreign policy of the regime it overthrew. Since then, Iran has oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour (promoting the Islamic revolution and struggling against non-Muslim tendencies abroad) and moves towards pragmatism (economic development and normalization of foreign relations). Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated the willingness of the Islamic revolutionaries to sacrifice trade and other ties with western countries to threaten an individual citizen of a foreign country living thousands of miles away. On the other hand, Khomeini's death in 1989 led more pragmatic policies, with Presidents [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]] leading the charge for more stable relations with the west as well as its surrounding, non-Revolutionary-Islamic neighbors\u2014i.e., [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following the 2005 election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]], Iran has returned to more a more hardline stance, frequently antagonizing the west and its neighbors while battling for control over the region.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the Islamic Republic [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|went to war]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] after the latter launched a military offensive in the 1980s. With most foreign aid going to Iraq, Iran was forced to accept a ceasefire by 1988. Tensions with Iraq remained long after the war; it was not until the death of Saddam himself that Iran and Iraq have started improving their relations.\n\nThe Islamic Republic founded and sponsored the Lebanese group known as [[Hezbollah]]; its leaders were followers of Khomeini. The creation of Hezbollah, and its funding from Iran, was in response to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Since then, Hezbollah has served as both an ally and a surrogate for Iran during its conflict with America and Israel. Author [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the Islamic Republic's as having \"lost most of its allure among non-Iranian Shia's,\" giving as examples the 1995 house arrest in Qom of the two sons of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, spiritual leader of the Bahraini Shia; and the close cooperation between the Afghan Shia party Wahdat and the U.S. Army after November 2001.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p.67\u201368</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic strongly supports the [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] cause. Government aid goes to everything from Palestinian hospitals to arms supplies. There is vigorous media publicity, an official \"Quds (Jerusalem) Day\", and squares and streets named after Palestine crisscross Iranian cities. Some question whether the issue has domestic grassroots support, arguing that Iranians \"lack emotional and cultural ties to Palestinians,\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.59</ref> or has been too costly in terms of [[opportunity cost]] compared to peaceful coexistence.<ref>One study estimates that conflict in the Middle East has cost the Iranian population a substantial fraction of per capita income in opportunity cost of foregone economic growth. [http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf A report by the Asian think tank Strategic Foresight Group] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519032453/http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf |date=2012-05-19 }} estimates the [[opportunity cost]] of conflict (i.e. not just the cost of arms and destruction but lack of economic growth that peaceful coexistence would have made possible) in the Middle East from 1991\u20132010 at a $12 trillion. Iran\u2019s share of the opportunity cost came to over $2.1 trillion. In other words had there been peace since 1991, the average Iranian citizen would have an estimated income of $7700 rather the $4100 that he or she will earn in 2010.</ref>\n\n===Human development===\n{{See also|Education in Iran|Health care in Iran|Bonyad}}\n[[File:Net Migration Iran.png|thumb|right|[[Net migration|Net Iranian migration]] (1979\u20132008).

Saddam sought to expand Iraq's access to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the oil reserves in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] (which also only has a substantial [[Arab]] population), and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country. Iranians also believe Saddam invaded with the encouragement of [[the United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries.\n\nA combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, declaring \"the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by the Islamic Republic.\"<ref>Wright, ''In the Name of God,'' (1989), p.126</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |access-date=2008-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160926/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |archive-date=2008-05-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe war continued for another six years under the slogans `War, War until Victory,` and `The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,`<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran,'' (2008), p.175</ref> but other countries, particularly the Soviet Union gave crucial aid to Iraq. The Iraqis also used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. As the costs mounted and Iranian morale waned, Khomeini finally accepted a truce called for by [[Wikisource: United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]]. By 1988, Iran was nearly bankrupted by the ruinous costs of the war and its manpower pool also exhausted. The Iranian Army in desperation began resorting to using boys as young as 14 in human wave attacks against Iraqi machine gun emplacements. Khomeini remarked that agreeing to peace with Iraq was \"like drinking poison\", but there was no other choice.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p.285</ref>  Although neither borders nor regimes were changed<ref>''The Longest War : Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'' by Dilip Hiro, (1991), p.255</ref> the war helped to `awaken the people and to fight the problems that threaten the revolution,` according to future president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]].<ref>Hiro, Dilip, The Longest War, Routledge, 1991, p.257</ref> An estimated 200,000 Iranians were killed<ref>IRI government estimate is 200,000 Iranian troops and civilians killed.</ref> and the war is estimated to have cost Iran $627 billion in total direct and indirect charges (in 1990 dollars).<ref>''The Longest War: Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'' by Dilip Hiro, (1991), p.250-1</ref>\n\n===Early laws of the Islamic Republic===\nThe new regime undid the Shah's old Family Protection Law, lowering the marriage age for girls back to nine and allowed husbands to divorce wives with the [[Triple talaq]], without court permission. It purged women from the judiciary and secular teachers from the educational system. It removed [[Baha'i]]s from government positions, closed down Baha'i Centers, and arrested and even executed their leaders.  A strict \"Islamic code of public appearance\" was enforced\u2014men were discouraged from wearing ties, women were obliged to wear either scarf and long coats or preferably the full chador.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.177</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nIran's economy suffered during the first decade following the revolution. Its currency, the rial, fell from 7 to the dollar before the revolution, to 1749 to the dollar in 1989.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\">Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.185</ref>  The revolution also is said to have put an end to the influence of \"the notables\", and created a very large public sector of the economy, when the government \"nationalizing their enterprises in order to keep their employees working... the state ended up with more than 2000 factories many of them operating in the red.\"<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), (p.176)</ref>\n\n===Human Rights===\n\nIn its early years, the revolutionary regime was especially criticized for its human rights record.<ref>''Iran: imprisonment, torture, and execution of political opponents'' / Amnesty International.  Amnesty International, 1992.</ref> In the first 28 months of the Islamic Republic, between February 1979 and June 1981, revolutionary courts executed 497 political opponents as \"counterrevolutionaries\", and \"sowers of corruption on earth\" ([[Mofsed-e-filarz]]). In the next four years from June 1981 until June 1985, the courts sentenced more than 8000 opponents to death.<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran'', University of California Press, 1999, pp.124\u2013129</ref>  After a relative lull, [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|thousands of political prisoners]] were executed in 1988.  Like other revolutions before it, the Iranian Revolution took a higher toll on those who had participated in the revolution than those in the regime it overthrew.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, Ervand 2008, p.181\"/>\n\n==Rafsanjani administration==\n{{See also|Rafsanjani#Presidency|l1=Rafsanjani presidency}}\n\n===Ideological changes by fatwa and constitution===\nTwo major changes in the ideological underpinnings of the Islamic Republic occurred toward the end of Khomeini's reign. In January 1988, he issued an edict declaring that the Islamic \"Government is among the most important divine injunctions and has priority over all peripheral divine orders ... even prayers, fasting and the Hajj.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.135</ref> In April of the next year he decreed a task force to revise the country's constitution to separate the post of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from that of Shia [[Marja'|marja]], (the `highest source of religious emulation`), since he found none of Marja to be suitable successors as none had given strong support for his policies.<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.146</ref>  The amendments were drafted and approved by the public about one month after Khomeini's death (1989 July 9). They paved the way for [[Ali Khamenei]] \u2013 a long time lieutenant of Khomeini, but a relatively low ranking cleric \u2013 to be Khomeini's successor as [[Supreme Leader]],<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, 2008, p.183</ref> but to critics they undermined the \"intellectual foundations\" of the Islamic Republic theocracy,<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand, ''Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic'', (University of California Press, c1993). p.34-5</ref><ref name=\"WMRI\">[http://www.danielpipes.org/article/273 The Western Mind of Radical Islam by Daniel Pipes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122122142/http://www.danielpipes.org/article/273 |date=2009-01-22 }} ''First Things'', December 1995</ref> breaking \"the charismatic bond between leader and followers.\"<ref>Brumberg, ''Reinventing Khomeini'', (2001), p.3</ref>\n\n===Political struggle===\n\nThe first post-war decade in Iran has been described as a time of pragmatism, and an `economy-first` policy.<ref>Pasri, Trita, ''Treacherous Alliance: the secret dealings of Israel, Iran and the United States'', Yale University Press, 2007, p.132</ref>  According to Shirin Ebadi, \"about two years into the postwar period, the Islamic Republic quietly changed course. ... It was fairly clear by then that the [[Shia]] revolution would not be sweeping the region.\"<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening: A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, (p.109)</ref>\n\n[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] was elected president shortly after Khomeini's death, and has been described as less revolutionary and \"isolationist\" than his rivals \u2014 \"economically liberal, politically authoritarian, and philosophically traditional.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.153</ref> (He served from August 17, 1989, to August 1997.)   While Leader Khamenei and the [[Council of Guardians]] generally supported these policies, in the parliament radical deputies initially had control, outnumbered Rafsanjani's \"pragmatic-conservative camp\" 90 to 160.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.155</ref>\n\nThe two groups differed strongly over economic and foreign policy, with radicals tending to support mass political participation and state control of the economy, and oppose normalization of relations with the West.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.162</ref>  Conservatives used the power to disqualify candidates from running for office to deal with this problem. \"The Council of Guardians disqualified nearly all radical candidates from the fall 1990 Assembly of Experts elections because they had failed to pass written and oral tests in Islamic jurisprudence.\"<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.173</ref> In the winter and spring of 1992 nearly one-third of the 3150 candidates for the 1992 election for the parliament were rejected, including 39 incumbents. Leading radicals such as Khalkhali, Nabvi, Bayat, and Hajjat al-Islam Hadi Ghaffari were sent packing because they lacked the \"proper Islamic credentials.\"<ref name=\"Brumberg, p.175\">Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.175</ref>\n\nIn late 1992 Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Seyed [[Mohammad Khatami]] and director of the Voice and Vision Broadcasting company [[Mohammad Hashemi]] Rafsanjani (brother of the president) were both forced out. By 1994 \"hundreds of intellectuals and supposed dissidents were in prison and some had been executed.\"  These purges cleared the regime of opponents but are thought to have set the stage for the [[Iranian reform movement|reform movement]], as exiled radicals warmed to the \"liberal\" values of freedom of speech, assembly, due process, etc.<ref name=\"Brumberg, p.175\"/>\n\n===Persian Gulf War===\nIraq invaded and overran [[Kuwait]] on August 2, 1990, causing a multinational coalition of UN forces to be assembled in response. Although Iran criticized the invasion and supported sanctions against its neighbor, it refused any active participation in the war, not surprising given the country's anti-Western attitudes and state of exhaustion from the recent conflict with its neighbor. As a result of the war and its aftermath, more than one million [[Kurds]] crossed the Iraqi border into Iran as [[refugees]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[File: Debt service-Iran.png|thumb|right|Iran's total [[Debt service ratio|debt service]] as percent of [[Balance of payments|exports of goods services and income]] increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997.]]\nDespite the \"economy first\" focus, Iran suffered serious economic problems during the Rafsanjani era. According to economist Bijan Khajehpour, economic growth in Iran between 1989 and 1994 was \"mainly financed through the accumulation of some $30 billion in foreign debt. In 1993, the ratio of Iran's foreign debt to the country's GDP reached 38%, which was alarming.\"<ref>\"Iran\u2019s Economy: 20 years after the Islamic Revolution\" by Bijan Khajehpour,\nfrom: ''Iran at the Crossroads'',  edited by John Esposito and R.K. Ramazani, New York : Palgrave, 2001, p.98</ref> A lack of foreign investment along with a fall in oil prices from $20 to $12 per barrel added to this external debt, and triggered an economic recession. The [[Iranian rial]] plummeted from 1749 to 6400 to the dollar in 1995. Unemployment reached 30%. The price of sugar, rice, and butter rose threefold, and that of bread sixfold.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\nIn part this economic downturn came from [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|American economic sanctions leveled in 1996]], when America suspended all trade with Iran, accusing Iran of supporting terrorist groups and attempting to develop [[nuclear weapons]]. The sanctions, in turn, may be traceable to the earlier [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] and the enmity of the US government which continued to see Iran as a major regional threat both to America and Israel.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\n===Birth control===\n{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}\nA new policy regarded as a success of the new government was its promotion of birth control. In 1989, the government, \"having previously encouraged population growth, reversed gears and declared that Islam favored families with only two children\". Birth control clinics were opened \u2013 especially for women. Condoms and pills were distributed. Subsidies to large families were cut. Sex education was introduced into the school curriculum, mandatory classes for newlyweds were held.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.184</ref>)\n\n==Khatami administration==\n[[File:TEPIX.PNG|thumb|right|Between March 2001 and April 2003, the [[Tehran Stock Exchange|TSE index]] (Topix) bucked the trend by going up nearly 80%.<ref>The Tehran Stock Exchange: A Maverick Performer?, Middle East Economic Survey, May 23, 2005,</ref>]]\n\nThe eight years of [[Mohammad Khatami]]'s two terms as president in 1997\u20132005 are sometimes called Iran's Reform Era.<ref>Ebadi, Shirin, ''Iran Awakening : A Memoir of Revolution and Hope'', by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006, p.180</ref>\n\nKhatami based his campaign on a reform program promising a more democratic and tolerant society, promotion of civil society, the rule of law and improvement of social rights.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2267/is_2_67/ai_63787333 |title=Civil Society and the Rule of Law in the Constitutional Politics of Iran Under Khatami \u2013 Iranian president Mohammad Khatami {{!}} Social Research {{!}} Find Articles at BNET.com |access-date=2007-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315125217/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2267/is_2_67/ai_63787333 |archive-date=2007-03-15 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/government/articles/civil_society_politics_iran_khatami.php |title=Civil Society and the Rule of Law in the Constitutional Politics of Iran Under Khatami \u2013Iranian president Mohammad Khatami |access-date=2007-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181614/http://www.iranchamber.com/government/articles/civil_society_politics_iran_khatami.php |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref> This included city council elections, adherence to Iran's  constitution, freedom to criticize high ranking authorities \u2013 including the [[supreme leader]], permission to operate newspapers of a wide range of political views, reopening the embassies of all European countries, reorganizing the [[Ministry of Intelligence of Iran]] after the Iran's [[Chain murders of Iran|Chain Murders of Intellectuals]], initiating a dialogue between people of different faith inside and outside Iran, also called \"[[Dialogue Among Civilizations]].\"\n\nIran's large youth demographic (by 1995, about half of the country's 60.5 million people had not been born after the Islamic Revolution) is one of Khatami's bases of support.\n\n{{See also|Mohammad Khatami's reforms|Iranian reform movement}}\n\n===Political and cultural changes===\nAt first, the new era saw significant liberalization.

[[Iran student protests, July 1999|Prodemocracy student demonstrations]] erupted at [[Tehran University]] and other urban campuses. These were followed by a wave of counter-demonstrations by [[Social conservatism|conservative]] factions.\n\n[[Reform]]ers won a substantial victory in Feb. 2000, [[parliamentary]] elections, capturing about two-thirds of the seats, but [[Social conservatism|conservative]] elements in the government forced the closure of the reformist press. Attempts by parliament to repeal restrictive press laws were forbidden by Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]]. Despite these conditions, President Khatami was overwhelming re-elected in June 2001. Tensions between reformers in parliament and conservatives in the [[judiciary]] and the [[Guardian Council]], over both [[social]] and [[economic]] changes, increased after Khatami's reelection.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Military expenditures-Iran.png|thumb|right|Military expenditures (% GDP)]]\nKhatami worked to improve relations with other countries visiting many other countries and holding a dialogue between civilizations and encouraged foreigners to invest in Iran. He announced Iran would accept a two-state solution for Palestine if Palestinians agreed to one, relaxed restrictions on the [[Persecution of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds|Bahais]], and assured Britain Iran would not implement the fatwa against [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Salman Rushdie]].<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.189</ref> Several [[European Union]] countries began renewing economic ties with Iran in the late 1990s, and trade and investment increased. In 1998, Britain re-established diplomatic relations with Iran, broken since the 1979 revolution.  The United States loosened its economic embargo, but it continued to block more normalized relations, arguing that the country had been implicated in international terrorism and was developing a [[nuclear weapons]] capacity. In his [[State of the Union Address]], United States President [[George W. Bush]] labeled Iran, along with [[Iraq]] and [[North Korea]], as an \"[[Axis of evil]].\"\n\nTensions with the United States increased after the [[Anglo-America]]n invasion of Iraq in March 2003, as U.S. officials increasingly denounced Iran for pursuing the alleged development of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe reform era ended with the conservatives defeat of Iranian reformists in the elections of 2003, 2004 and 2005 \u2013 the local, parliamentary, and presidential elections. According to at least one observer, the reformists were defeated not so much by a growth of support for conservative Islamist policies as by division within the reformist movement and the banning of many reform candidates which discouraged pro-reform voters from voting.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.194\"/>\n\n==Ahmadinejad's administration==\n{{Main|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005\u20132013)}}\n{{Update|date=December 2009}}\n\n[[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected to the presidency twice, in [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|2005]] and [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009]].

The action was denounced by the United States as one which would give Iran the capability to develop nuclear weapons. The [[IAEA]] said that there was no [[evidence]] that Iran was seeking to develop such arms. However, the IAEA also called for Iran to abandon its plans to produce [[enriched uranium]]. In November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend [[uranium enrichment]] but subsequently indicated that it would not be held to the suspension if the negotiations the [[European Union|EU]] nations failed.\n\nDuring an October 2013 meeting, however, Iran agreed, in negotiations with several Western European nations, to toughen international inspections of its nuclear installations.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf \"Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program: Tehran\u2019s Compliance with International Obligations\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507202756/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf |date=2017-05-07 }} Congressional Research Service, 4 April 2017.</ref> Nonetheless, the international community continued to express concerns over Iran's nuclear program.

Its  [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] was approved in 1979 and amended in 1989. [[Twelvers|Jaafari]] ([[Usuli]]) school of thought is the official religion.  It has an elected president and elected governmental bodies at the national, provincial and local levels for which all males and females from the age of 18 on up may vote, which are supervised by theocratic bodies, particularly the [[Council of Guardians]] which had veto power over who can run for parliament (or [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]) and whether its bills can become law. Nonetheless the elected organs have more power than equivalent ones in the Shah's government.\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Main|Iran's foreign policy}}\nFollowing the 1979 [[Iranian revolution|revolution]] in Iran, the Islamic revolutionary regime of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] dramatically reversed the pro-Western foreign policy of the regime it overthrew. Since then, Iran has oscillated between the two opposing tendencies of revolutionary ardour (promoting the Islamic revolution and struggling against non-Muslim tendencies abroad) and moves towards pragmatism (economic development and normalization of foreign relations). Khomeini's 1989 [[fatwa]] calling for the killing of British citizen [[Salman Rushdie]] for his allegedly blasphemous book, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|The Satanic Verses]], demonstrated the willingness of the Islamic revolutionaries to sacrifice trade and other ties with western countries to threaten an individual citizen of a foreign country living thousands of miles away. On the other hand, Khomeini's death in 1989 led more pragmatic policies, with Presidents [[Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammad Khatami]] leading the charge for more stable relations with the west as well as its surrounding, non-Revolutionary-Islamic neighbors\u2014i.e., [[Saudi Arabia]]. Following the 2005 election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]], Iran has returned to more a more hardline stance, frequently antagonizing the west and its neighbors while battling for control over the region.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the Islamic Republic [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|went to war]] against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Iraq]] after the latter launched a military offensive in the 1980s. With most foreign aid going to Iraq, Iran was forced to accept a ceasefire by 1988. Tensions with Iraq remained long after the war; it was not until the death of Saddam himself that Iran and Iraq have started improving their relations.\n\nThe Islamic Republic founded and sponsored the Lebanese group known as [[Hezbollah]]; its leaders were followers of Khomeini. The creation of Hezbollah, and its funding from Iran, was in response to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon. Since then, Hezbollah has served as both an ally and a surrogate for Iran during its conflict with America and Israel. Author [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the Islamic Republic's as having \"lost most of its allure among non-Iranian Shia's,\" giving as examples the 1995 house arrest in Qom of the two sons of Grand Ayatollah Shirazi, spiritual leader of the Bahraini Shia; and the close cooperation between the Afghan Shia party Wahdat and the U.S. Army after November 2001.<ref>Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p.67\u201368</ref>\n\nThe Islamic Republic strongly supports the [[Palestinian state|Palestinian]] cause. Government aid goes to everything from Palestinian hospitals to arms supplies. There is vigorous media publicity, an official \"Quds (Jerusalem) Day\", and squares and streets named after Palestine crisscross Iranian cities. Some question whether the issue has domestic grassroots support, arguing that Iranians \"lack emotional and cultural ties to Palestinians,\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p.59</ref> or has been too costly in terms of [[opportunity cost]] compared to peaceful coexistence.<ref>One study estimates that conflict in the Middle East has cost the Iranian population a substantial fraction of per capita income in opportunity cost of foregone economic growth.

Iran\u2019s share of the opportunity cost came to over $2.1 trillion.

On November 4, 1979, Iranian students seized the [[United States|U.S.]] embassy in [[Tehran]] holding 52 embassy employees hostage for 444 days.  The [[Carter administration]] severed diplomatic relations and imposed [[economic sanctions]] on April 7, 1980, and later that month unsuccessfully attempted a rescue that further enhanced Khomeini's prestige in Iran.  On May 24 the [[International Court of Justice]] called for the [[hostage]]s to be released.  Finally, the hostages were released 20 January 1981, by agreement of the Carter Administration, see [[Algiers Accords]] Jan. 19, 1981.  The crisis also marked the beginning of American legal action, or sanctions, that economically separated Iran from America. Sanctions blocked all property within US jurisdiction owned by the Central Bank and Government of Iran.<ref>[http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm History Of US Sanctions Against Iran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010024317/http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/108E16.htm |date=2017-10-10 }} Middle East Economic Survey, 26-August-2002</ref>\n\n====Suppression of opposition====\nRevolutionary factions disagreed on the shape of the new Iran. Those who thought the Shah would be replaced by a democratic government soon found Khomeini disagreed. In early March 1979, he  announced, \"do not use this term, \u2018democratic.\u2019 That is the Western style.\"<ref>Bakhash, Shaul, ''The Reign of the Ayatollahs'', p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn succession the [[National Democratic Front (Iran)|National Democratic Front]] was banned in August 1979, the [[The Interim Government of Iran|provisional government]] was disempowered in November, the [[Muslim People's Republican Party]] banned in January 1980, the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] guerrillas came under attack in February 1980, a purge of universities was begun in March 1980, and leftist President [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] was impeached in June 1981.\n\nExplanations for why Khomeini supporters were successful in crushing the opposition include lack of unity in the opposition. According to Asghar Schirazi, the moderates lacked ambition and were not well organized, while the radicals (such [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] or PMOI) were \"unrealistic\" about the conservatism of the Iranian masses and unprepared to work with moderates to fight against theocracy. Moderate Islamists, such as Banisadr, were \"credulous and submissive\" towards Khomeini.<ref>Schirazi, Asghar, ''The Constitution of Iran: politics and the state in the Islamic Republic'', London; New York: I.B. Tauris, 1997, p.293-4</ref>\n\n====Terrorist attacks====\nThe ouster of President Banisadr did not put an immediate end to the opposition but moved it to terror.  Hundreds of PMOI supporters and members were killed from 1979 to 1981, and some 3,000 were arrested,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 |title=The address you were looking for doesn't exist |publisher=Tkb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115114802/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3632 |archive-date=2008-01-15 |url-status=live }}</ref> but unlike other opposition is driven underground by the regime, the PMOI was able to retaliate.\n\nOn 28 June 1981, bombs were detonated at the headquarters of the since-dissolved [[Islamic Republic Party]]. Around 70 high-ranking officials, including Chief Justice [[Mohammad Beheshti]] (who was the second most powerful figure in the revolution after Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] at the time), cabinet members, and members of parliament, were killed. The PMOI never publicly confirmed or denied any  responsibility for the deed, but only stated the attack was `a natural and necessary reaction to the regime's atrocities.` Khomeini did accuse them of responsibility and, according to BBC journalist [[Baqer Moin]], the PMOI were \"generally perceived as the culprits\" for it in Iran.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.241</ref>  Two months later on August 30, another bomb was detonated killing President [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai|Rajai]] and Premier [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]].  A member of the PMOI, Mas'ud Kashmiri, was announced as the perpetrator, and according to regime reports came close to killing the entire government including Khomeini.<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.242-3</ref>  The reaction following both bombings was intense with thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions of PMOI and other leftist groups,<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini'', (2000), p. 241\u20132.</ref> but \"assassinations of leading officials and active supporters of the regime by the PMOI were to continue for the next year or two.\"<ref>Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243</ref>\n\n===Iran\u2013Iraq War===\n{{Main|Iran\u2013Iraq War}}\n\nThe eight-year-long [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (September 1980 \u2013 August 1988, known as The Imposed War in Iran<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/articles/lessons-from-americas-first-war-with-iran/</ref>) was the most important international event for the first decade of the Islamic Republic and possibly for its history so far. It helped to strengthen the revolution although it cost Iran much in lives and treasure.\n\nShortly after the success of the revolution, revolutionary leader  [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] began calling for Islamic revolutions across the [[Islamic world|Muslim world]], including Iran's Arab neighbor Iraq,<ref>1980 April 8 \u2013 Broadcast call by Khomeini for the pious of Iraq to overthrow Saddam and his regime. Al-Dawa al-Islamiya party in Iraqi is the hoped-for catalyst to start the rebellion.

The leadership in Tehran believed that they would launch a massive Shiite uprising across the Middle East and after Iraq's defeat, march on Israel and destroy it.\n\nThe war began with [[Iraq]]'s invasion of Iran, in an attempt by Iraq's dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] to take advantage of the perceived post-revolutionary military weakness in Iran and the Revolution's unpopularity with Western governments. Much of the top leadership of Iran's once-strong Iranian military had been executed. Saddam sought to expand Iraq's access to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the oil reserves in [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] (which also only has a substantial [[Arab]] population), and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi'a majority of his country. Iranians also believe Saddam invaded with the encouragement of [[the United States]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and other countries.\n\nA combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and by early 1982 Iran regained almost all the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini's stature and allowed him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, declaring \"the regime in Baghdad must fall and must be replaced by the Islamic Republic.\"<ref>Wright, ''In the Name of God,'' (1989), p.126</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |title=Time Magazine |access-date=2008-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160926/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950688,00.html |archive-date=2008-05-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe war continued for another six years under the slogans `War, War until Victory,` and `The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,`<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran,'' (2008), p.175</ref> but other countries, particularly the Soviet Union gave crucial aid to Iraq. The Iraqis also used chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers. As the costs mounted and Iranian morale waned, Khomeini finally accepted a truce called for by [[Wikisource: United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]]. By 1988, Iran was nearly bankrupted by the ruinous costs of the war and its manpower pool also exhausted. The Iranian Army in desperation began resorting to using boys as young as 14 in human wave attacks against Iraqi machine gun emplacements. Khomeini remarked that agreeing to peace with Iraq was \"like drinking poison\", but there was no other choice.<ref>Moin, ''Khomeini,'' (2000), p.285</ref>  Although neither borders nor regimes were changed<ref>''The Longest War : Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'' by Dilip Hiro, (1991), p.255</ref> the war helped to `awaken the people and to fight the problems that threaten the revolution,` according to future president [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]].<ref>Hiro, Dilip, The Longest War, Routledge, 1991, p.257</ref> An estimated 200,000 Iranians were killed<ref>IRI government estimate is 200,000 Iranian troops and civilians killed.</ref> and the war is estimated to have cost Iran $627 billion in total direct and indirect charges (in 1990 dollars).<ref>''The Longest War: Iran-Iraq Military Conflict'' by Dilip Hiro, (1991), p.250-1</ref>\n\n===Early laws of the Islamic Republic===\nThe new regime undid the Shah's old Family Protection Law, lowering the marriage age for girls back to nine and allowed husbands to divorce wives with the [[Triple talaq]], without court permission. It purged women from the judiciary and secular teachers from the educational system. It removed [[Baha'i]]s from government positions, closed down Baha'i Centers, and arrested and even executed their leaders.  A strict \"Islamic code of public appearance\" was enforced\u2014men were discouraged from wearing ties, women were obliged to wear either scarf and long coats or preferably the full chador.<ref>Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.177</ref>\n\n===Economy===\nIran's economy suffered during the first decade following the revolution.

In January 1988, he issued an edict declaring that the Islamic \"Government is among the most important divine injunctions and has priority over all peripheral divine orders ... even prayers, fasting and the Hajj.\"<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.135</ref> In April of the next year he decreed a task force to revise the country's constitution to separate the post of [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] from that of Shia [[Marja'|marja]], (the `highest source of religious emulation`), since he found none of Marja to be suitable successors as none had given strong support for his policies.<ref>Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini: The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p.146</ref>  The amendments were drafted and approved by the public about one month after Khomeini's death (1989 July 9).

While Leader Khamenei and the [[Council of Guardians]] generally supported these policies, in the parliament radical deputies initially had control, outnumbered Rafsanjani's \"pragmatic-conservative camp\" 90 to 160.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.155</ref>\n\nThe two groups differed strongly over economic and foreign policy, with radicals tending to support mass political participation and state control of the economy, and oppose normalization of relations with the West.<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini,'' (2001), p.162</ref>  Conservatives used the power to disqualify candidates from running for office to deal with this problem. \"The Council of Guardians disqualified nearly all radical candidates from the fall 1990 Assembly of Experts elections because they had failed to pass written and oral tests in Islamic jurisprudence.\"<ref>Brumberg,  ''Reinventing Khomeini''  p.173</ref> In the winter and spring of 1992 nearly one-third of the 3150 candidates for the 1992 election for the parliament were rejected, including 39 incumbents.

Although Iran criticized the invasion and supported sanctions against its neighbor, it refused any active participation in the war, not surprising given the country's anti-Western attitudes and state of exhaustion from the recent conflict with its neighbor. As a result of the war and its aftermath, more than one million [[Kurds]] crossed the Iraqi border into Iran as [[refugees]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[File: Debt service-Iran.png|thumb|right|Iran's total [[Debt service ratio|debt service]] as percent of [[Balance of payments|exports of goods services and income]] increased sixfold between 1990 and 1997.]]\nDespite the \"economy first\" focus, Iran suffered serious economic problems during the Rafsanjani era. According to economist Bijan Khajehpour, economic growth in Iran between 1989 and 1994 was \"mainly financed through the accumulation of some $30 billion in foreign debt. In 1993, the ratio of Iran's foreign debt to the country's GDP reached 38%, which was alarming.\"<ref>\"Iran\u2019s Economy: 20 years after the Islamic Revolution\" by Bijan Khajehpour,\nfrom: ''Iran at the Crossroads'',  edited by John Esposito and R.K.

The [[Iranian rial]] plummeted from 1749 to 6400 to the dollar in 1995. Unemployment reached 30%. The price of sugar, rice, and butter rose threefold, and that of bread sixfold.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\nIn part this economic downturn came from [[Iran and Libya Sanctions Act|American economic sanctions leveled in 1996]], when America suspended all trade with Iran, accusing Iran of supporting terrorist groups and attempting to develop [[nuclear weapons]]. The sanctions, in turn, may be traceable to the earlier [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]] and the enmity of the US government which continued to see Iran as a major regional threat both to America and Israel.<ref name=\"Abrahamian, 2008 p.185\"/>\n\n===Birth control===\n{{Main|Family planning in Iran}}\nA new policy regarded as a success of the new government was its promotion of birth control.

In mid-2004 Iran began resuming the processing of [[nuclear fuel]] as part of its plan to achieve self-sufficiency in civilian nuclear power production, stating that the negotiations with [[European Union]] nations had failed to bring access to the advanced [[nuclear technology]] that was promised. The action was denounced by the United States as one which would give Iran the capability to develop nuclear weapons. The [[IAEA]] said that there was no [[evidence]] that Iran was seeking to develop such arms. However, the IAEA also called for Iran to abandon its plans to produce [[enriched uranium]]. In November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend [[uranium enrichment]] but subsequently indicated that it would not be held to the suspension if the negotiations the [[European Union|EU]] nations failed.\n\nDuring an October 2013 meeting, however, Iran agreed, in negotiations with several Western European nations, to toughen international inspections of its nuclear installations.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf \"Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program: Tehran\u2019s Compliance with International Obligations\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507202756/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/R40094.pdf |date=2017-05-07 }} Congressional Research Service, 4 April 2017.</ref> Nonetheless, the international community continued to express concerns over Iran's nuclear program.

Later the church failed and was returned, along with the surrounding lands, back to the kingdom and [[Engelbert II of Berg]], Archbishop of [[Cologne]].\n\nThe first recorded message of the place name ''St. Laurentii Bergh'' is from 1218, when the archbishop gave the area to the Church of Mary, which was a predecessor of the [[Aachen Cathedral]] and of which the Archbishop had previously been a [[provost (religion)|provost]].
