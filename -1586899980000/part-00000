He was then called up to the Test squad for the [[Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 2009\u201310|tour of New Zealand]] in March 2010 to replace Shane Watson in the first Test; he scored a rapid 86 from 75 balls in a small fourth-innings run chase in this Test.\n\nHughes was dropped from the [[2010\u20132011 Ashes]] squad, but was called up for the Third Test as a replacement for the injured Simon Katich. He was a regular in the Australian team for the following year, playing in the last three Ashes tests, tours of Sri Lanka and South Africa and then a home series against New Zealand, but his spot came under pressure due to his inconsistency during that time.

Upon return to Australia, Hughes left his home state of New South Wales, moving to South Australia. This resulted in a strong return of runs in first-class cricket in the [[Sheffield Shield]] and one day cricket in the [[Ryobi Cup]]. These returns earned Hughes a recall to the Australian Test team to face Sri Lanka in Hobart following the retirement of [[Ricky Ponting]] in December 2012.

He made two half centuries during his comeback scoring 233 runs at 46.60 in what was the most successful stint at the number 3 spot that the Australians had seen for some time.

He achieved two big scores (126 in [[Sinhalese Sports Club Ground|Colombo]] and 88 in [[Wanderers Stadium|Johannesburg]]), but his next-highest score was only 36,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/272364.html?class=1;template=results;type=allround;view=match|title=PJ Hughes, All-Round Analysis|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate= 14 December 2011}}</ref> and he consistently fell to catches at slip and gully. He was heavily criticised for his performance in the two-Test series against New Zealand, in which he managed only 41 runs at 10.25, and was dismissed exactly the same way in all four innings: caught at slip by [[Martin Guptill]] from the bowling of [[Chris Martin (cricketer)|Chris Martin]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-new-zealand-2011/content/story/544980.html|title=Martin and Guptill clean sweep Hughes|first=Brydon|last=Coverdale|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=27 November 2014|publisher=Cricinfo}}</ref> He was dropped from the Australian team following the series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/phillip-hughes-skips-big-bash-to-work-on-technique/story-fn67w6pa-1226222057867|title=Phillip Hughes skips Big Bash to work on technique|date=14 December 2011|accessdate=14 December 2011|first=Richard|last=Earle|newspaper=Herald Sun}}</ref>\n\nIn a stint for [[Worcestershire]] in the English County Cricket competition, Hughes made adjustments to his much maligned technique resulting in a more expansive range of strokes with more emphasis on legside play. Upon return to Australia, Hughes left his home state of New South Wales, moving to South Australia. This resulted in a strong return of runs in first-class cricket in the [[Sheffield Shield]] and one day cricket in the [[Ryobi Cup]]. These returns earned Hughes a recall to the Australian Test team to face Sri Lanka in Hobart following the retirement of [[Ricky Ponting]] in December 2012. He made an impressive first inning 86 batting at number 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/12/06/cricket-australia-squad-idINL4N09G0HP20121206|title=Cricket-Hughes recalled to replace Ponting in Sri Lanka test|first=Nick|last=Mulvenney|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter almost a year away from the Test arena, Hughes found himself back in the Test side for the series against Sri Lanka in lieu of the retiring Ricky Ponting, occupying the number 3 position over Watson. Immediately he made an impact, scoring a solid 86 in the first Test match at Hobart, with a new-found confidence and tighter technique that had eluded him 12 months prior. He made two half centuries during his comeback scoring 233 runs at 46.60 in what was the most successful stint at the number 3 spot that the Australians had seen for some time. Hughes was set to receive a $1 million contract with Cricket Australia and be selected in Australia's ODI and T20 international squads in the wake of Michael Hussey's international retirement at the end of the 2012/13 Australia summer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Earle|first=Richard|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/phil-hughes-in-line-to-join-australias-odi-and-t20-squads-in-wake-of-mike-husseys-retirement/story-fn2mcu3x-1226545552913#.UOEUMKmNOfR|title=Phil Hughes in line to join Australia's ODI and T20 squads in wake of Mike Hussey's retirement|publisher=[[Fox Sports]]|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> Hughes' selection in the Australian ODI squad was confirmed on 6 January 2013.

{"title_page": "List of Monsters, Inc. characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Monsters, Inc.'' characters}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{in-universe|date=June 2013}}\n{{Overlinked|date=June 2019}}\n}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' from the [[Pixar]] [[media franchise]] ''[[Monsters, Inc. (franchise)|Monsters, Inc.]]'', including the 2001 film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and the 2013 film ''[[Monsters University]]'', and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.\n\n==Setting==\n\n\nThe monster characters reside in the city of Monstropolis. According to a DVD bonus feature, Monstropolis was founded after all of the [[monster]]s who once co-existed with [[human]]s were chased off the mainland and eventually moved to an island on an unknown world where they have lived ever since. The only way for them to enter human-inhabited areas was via closet doors.\n\nThe company Monsters, Inc. provides Monstropolis with power from the screams of human children that have been scared by specialized agents who work for Monsters, Inc. called \"scarers\". There are also companies that rival Monsters, Inc. in this endeavor, such as Fear Co. and Scream Industries.\n\nThe city also provides universities at which monsters can study to scare, the most prominent in the storyline being Monsters University for its outstanding Scaring Program. One of its rivals is a college called Fear Tech.\n\n==Appearing in both films ==\n\n==={{Anchor|James P. Sullivan}}Sulley===\n'''James P. Sullivan''' or '''Sulley''' (voiced by [[John Goodman]] in the film series, [[Brian Cummings]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|''Monsters, Inc.'' video game]], Joel McCrary in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', Christopher Swindle in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a tall blue-furred giant ogre with horns, purple spots, razor-sharp claws on his hands, furry talons for feet, a [[theropod]]-like tail, spikes running down his back and [[shark]]-like fangs. Even though he excels at scaring children, he is kindhearted, thoughtful and affects a relaxed, amiable personality. In the film's beginning, he is \"The Best Scarer\" for several months running.\n\n''[[Monsters University]]'' depicts the college-age Sulley as a talented but lazy student whose father Bill had made a name for himself as a proficient Scarer. He and Mike start as arch-rivals in their introductory scaring class, but eventually form a friendship that lasts even beyond their expulsion from the university.\n\n===Mike Wazowski===\n'''Michael''' \"'''Mike'''\" '''Wazowski''' (voiced by [[Billy Crystal]] in the film series, [[Carlos Alazraqui]] in the video games, Merchandise, attractions and commercials, Noah Johnston as his younger self in ''[[Monsters University]]''), is a one-eyed green monster with a round body and two small horns. He also has claws, but they are not as sharp as Sulley's.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Monsters University]]'', Mike is depicted as a proud monster. Mike had a lonesome childhood and struggled to make friends. On a class field trip to ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Mike was inspired to become a scarer professionally, but other students made fun of him because he was perceived as undeniably \"unscary\". Even though he is the scariest monster no cap.\n\nEven so, Mike was accepted into Monsters University's scare program, where he was introduced to James P. Sullivan in a SCARE 101 class. Mike initially disliked Sulley for his arrogance and bad work ethic. This dislike escalated into a major disruption made in class which resulted in Mike and Sulley's expulsion from the scare program. Mike then works out a deal with the dean of the school to re-enroll in the program on the stipulation that he wins the Games. Sulley joins Mike, despite Mike\u2019s protestations.\n\nMike and Sulley joined the Oozma Kappa fraternity at Monsters University to qualify for the Games. Mike and Sulley begin to build a friendship as they compete together. During the final event, Sulley cheats, and both Mike and Sulley are expelled from school. After being expelled, the two were offered jobs as workers in the Monsters, Inc. mailroom nonetheless. They advance through the ranks until Sully is a scarer and Mike is his assistant. In Monsters, Inc., Mike runs Sulley's station on the scare floor and they are close friends and roommates. Mike is dating Celia Mae at this time. Additionally, Mike helps Sulley in his mission to save Boo.\n\nMike is portrayed as a comedian in [[Tomorrowland]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in [[Walt Disney World Resort]] attraction, [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]]. Mike is not only known for his humor, but also his intelligence. He has made appearances in other Pixar movies, such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mikewazowskimania.weebly.com/|title=Mike Wazowski Mania|website=Mike Wazowski Mania|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Randall Boggs ===\n'''Randall Boggs''' (voiced by [[Steve Buscemi]] in the film series, [[Peter Kelamis]] in the ''Disney Infinity'' video game series, [[J. P. Manoux|J.P. Manoux]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|video game]] and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a purple, eight-legged [[chameleon]]-like monster with an ability to change skin color and blend in with his surroundings. He is very flexible, nimble and is an excellent climber. He is Sulley's nemesis and Mike's arch-rival and former best friend.\n\nIn ''Monsters, Inc.'', he is Sulley's arch-rival on the scare floor, as well as Jeffrey Fungus' boss. The two vie for position as the area's top scream collector, a competition set up to encourage working. Ironically, Randall does manage to win top position for a few seconds, until Sulley comes back from a slumber party, thus winning it back. They also compete for The All-Time Scare Record. Henry J. Waternoose secretly approaches Randall and orders him to build a scream extraction machine, a vacuum-like device, and use it on kidnapped children to save the company and solving the energy crisis at large. One night, Randall leaves a door activated on the Scare Floor, when he was doing a bit of late-night work, and a little girl, later dubbed Boo, wanders out. Randall makes several attempts to get information out of Mike and Sulley on where the kid is. With Waternoose's help, Randall helps banish Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas and kidnap Boo. However, before they could extract the scream from her, Mike and Sulley return and Sulley destroys the machine, rescuing Boo. After a long chase through the millions of doors in the factory's door storage facility, Boo eventually conquers her fear of Randall and buys Sulley enough time to defeat him. Afterwards, Randall is forcibly exiled to the human world and winds up in a mobile home where the inhabitants beat him senseless, believing him to be an alligator. Sulley and Mike then destroy the door to prevent Randall from returning to the monster world.\n\nIn the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Randall enrolls at the same time as Mike and the two end up as friends and roommates. He is insecure and shy at first, having trouble controlling his camouflage abilities, but is a model bookworm. When Randall is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the top fraternity in the university, he quickly abandons Mike in order retain his standing with the fraternity. He slowly becomes more ambitious and confident, and ultimately becomes less empathetic and more self-centered. After an embarrassing failure at the Scare Games to Sulley, an embittered Randall vows to himself to never be outdone by Sulley again, thus starting their unfortunate conflict in Monsters, Inc.\n\n===Roz===\t\n\n'''Roz''' (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]) is a slug-like monster who is the key master and administrator of Scare Floor F. Near the end of the film, she is revealed to be Number One of the CDA, having been on an undercover assignment to investigate the company and expose Randall and Waternoose's scheme.\n\nShe also makes surprise appearances in three outtakes of the film: when Boo is in the toilet cubicle with Sulley, the CDA shaves and showers George Sanderson, and when Sulley proves to Boo that there is no one behind his closet door.\n\nShe appears briefly near the end of the prequel as a member of the CDA squad that responds to the break-in at the Door Lab. Although she wears a full-body protective suit that covers her face, her shape and voice give away her identity.\n\n===CDA===\nThe '''CDA''' (short for '''Child Detection Agency''' and voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Bill Farmer]], [[Pete Docter]], [[Lee Unkrich]], [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and [[Teddy Newton]]) are an assortment of different monsters in [[hazmat suit]]s whose main job is to respond to any reported incidents of contact between monsters and children or their belongings, since it is believed that human objects are toxic. They isolate and destroy any items accidentally brought back into the monster world. Any monsters that comes in contact with a human object are quickly and forcibly decontaminated while having a neck cone applied afterwards.\n\nThey first appear when George Sanderson gets a sock on him and they had to decontaminate him after the sock is destroyed. When Boo gets into Monstropolis and appears at Harryhausen's, the CDA end up decontaminating the building and then disinfected the patrons. They later find the bag containing Boo that Mike and Sulley left behind at the restaurant, which traced them back to Monsters, Inc. where they end up searching the building. In one moment, two of the CDA members ask Sulley for an autograph to give to Bethany, the daughter of agent 00002, whom he mentions. Henry J. Waternoose had the CDA called in to cut the power to Boo's door as soon as it lands so as to contain Boo and arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike does a diversion that involved throwing one of Boo's socks on one of the agents and then had the other agents chase him. This trick enabled the CDA Agents to be present when Henry confesses his motives that involved abducting children to keep Monsters, Inc. alive. The CDA Agents arrest Waternoose as Mike and Sulley discover that Roz is the Number One of the CDA. During the credits, a CDA agent directs a monster to his seat during Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', the CDA are called when Mike and Sulley had entered a door that led to a human area. After Mike and Sulley make it back to Monsters University, they are taken away by the CDA.\n\n===Abominable Snowman===\n\nThe '''[[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) or '''Yeti''', is a white-furred monster from Monstropolis who got banished to the [[Himalayas]] in the human world. He is an expert of making [[snow cone]]s. He greets Sulley and Mike when Waternoose and Randall banish them to the Himalayas. While the Abominable Snowman tries to make Mike and Sulley feel at home in his abode, he understands Sulley must rescue Boo, and tells him of a [[Nepal]]ese village at the foot of the mountain whereupon they can regain access to the monster world. Despite everything, the Abominable Snowman seems to have made the best of his fate and genuinely seems to enjoy the human world.\n\nIn the credits to ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', he appeared as the '''Abominable [[Snowplow]]'''.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was shown to have worked as a [[mailroom]] supervisor at Monsters, Inc.. He warns Mike and Sulley not to mess with the mail which is a crime punished by banishment (which possibly hints why he was banished).\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters, Inc.''==\n===Boo===\n'''Boo''' (voiced by Mary Gibbs) is a 2-year-old human girl who becomes Sulley and Mike's friend.\n\nDuring Randall's secret late-night work on the Scare Floor, Boo gets into the factory and Sulley tries various attempts to put her back, none of which worked, so he eventually puts her inside a [[duffle bag]]. When Sulley brings this up with Mike at Harryhausen's, Boo gets out and frightens the patrons; the CDA have to \"decontaminate\" the restaurant. While Mike and Sulley are at home, they discover that the girl is not toxic after all. Sulley quickly grows attached to the girl and names her \"Boo\". The next day, they smuggle her into the factory disguised as a child of one of Sulley's relatives, and Mike attempts to return her through her door. Randall tries to kidnap Boo, but kidnaps Mike by mistake. Boo may not be afraid of Sulley, but when she was brought into the simulation room after Mike and Sulley escaped from Randall, she ended up severely frightened by Sulley's roar. When Mike and Sulley tried to return Boo to her home, Mr. Waternoose had Mike and Sulley exiled to the Himalayas. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from Randall's Scream Extractor. During the chase through the large storage vault, Boo's laughter ends up causing all the doors to operate. Eventually, Boo gets over being afraid of Randall, and helps to defeat him. Sulley and Mike are able to access Boo's door, but Mr. Waternoose and the CDA send it back to the Scare Floor. Mike distracts the CDA, while Sulley escapes with Boo and her door, although Waternoose follows. The CDA's undercover leader is revealed to be Roz, and she allows Sulley and Mike 5 minutes to return Boo to her world. Once Sulley and Mike have returned Boo to her room, her door is put through the shredder. Sometime later, Mike takes Sulley aside revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door requiring only one more piece which Sulley had taken as a memento, the one taped to his clipboard. Sulley inserts the last piece, reactivates the door and enters to find Boo there.\n\nBoo has had other cameo appearances in other Pixar films including ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.\n\n===Monsters, Inc. employees===\n====Henry J. Waternoose III ====\n'''Henry J. Waternoose III''' (voiced by [[James Coburn]]) is a five-eyed humanoid [[crustacean]]-like monster who is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Monsters, Inc.. The company has been in Waternoose's family for 3 generations as he had inherited the company from his father at the age of 142. Waternoose also previously had a mentoring relationship with Sulley.  The monster wants to be the best one ever. \n\nWaternoose is first seen where he reminds Thaddeus Bile and the other trainees about the dangers of a human child getting into Monstropolis after Thaddeus left the door opened. He has been impressed with Sulley's progress. However, Mr. Waternoose is distraught to learn that the impending energy crisis is increasing, due to many children being desensitized and being unable to be scared by monsters, which might put the company on the verge of being shut down. \n\nWhen Sulley tells Waternoose that he can get the company through the energy crisis, Waternoose tells Sulley to tell that to the [[board of director]]s. When Boo is eventually discovered and Sulley and Mike wanted to return her home, Waternoose agrees to help them, but he later reveals that he and Randall are hand in glove. Waternoose was actually planning to kidnap Boo and several more children to extract their screams to fight the energy crisis and that Randall himself is just an accomplice to Waternoose's plan. \n\nAt that point, Waternoose betrayed both Sulley and Mike by exiling them to the Himalayas to ensure that they don't interfere with their plans any further (as they have found out too much about their scheme), though Waternoose would later regret his actions; he even argues with Randall about how he should not have trusted him since it led to him banishing his top employees in order to prevent them from exposing their scheme to the public. Regardless, Randall tells Waternoose the Scream Extractor would revolutionize Monsters, Inc., that there won't be any need for scarers and that Mike and Sulley \"got what they deserved\". Before Boo's screams can be extracted, Sulley returns and rescues Boo while destroying the machine and using it to pin Randall, Waternoose, and Fungus to the wall (although Randall was quick enough to avoid being trapped) before escaping as Randall gives pursuit. After Sulley and Mike defeat Randall and trap him in the [[Everglades]], Mr. Waternoose has called in the CDA to help apprehend Boo and arrest Sulley and Mike, attempting to frame them as the criminals responsible for the incident. Mike, carrying who they think is Boo, distracts them before running off. While the CDA gave chase to Mike, Sulley ran off with Boo as Waternoose gives chase after they accidentally get his attention. Waternoose follows Sulley to the simulation bedroom before Sulley jams the entrance shut with a metal pipe to hold back Waternoose long enough for Sulley to install Boo's door and supposedly activating it. He eventually manages to break through. In the room, Sulley confronts and argues with Waternoose over his and Randall's wrongdoings. Waternoose declares he will not stop attempting to end the energy crisis, even if it means kidnapping many children and doing away with anyone who stands in his way to ensure that their plot remains a secret. Brutishly knocking Sulley out of his way, he tries to grab Boo from the bed, but instead grabs the simulation child. Just then, the wall goes up to reveal that Mike is behind the controls and he records Sulley and Waternoose's confrontation, exposing Waternoose and Randall's plot as the corruptive CEO watches in shock, now realizing that he had been tricked. With this incriminating evidence and now knowing who the real criminal is, the CDA turns on Waternoose and arrests him. As he is being dragged away, Waternoose yells at Sulley, claiming that he destroyed the company and that the energy crisis will only get worse because of him before he is pulled out of the room. Waternoose is last seen loaded onto the CDA's van and taken to prison for his crimes as Sulley becomes the new CEO of Monsters, Inc., proving Waternoose's theory incorrect by changing the company's approach from scaring to laughter, allowing the company to gain enough power to end the energy crisis for good.\n\nDespite not appearing in the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Waternoose is seen in a photo at the end of the movie shaking hands with Mike and Sulley as they are being promoted to becoming a Scare Team.\n\nThe [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon processor]], used in the [[Xbox 360]], developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]] under the IBM chip program was codenamed \"Waternoose\" in the character's honor.<ref>[https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/learning-failure/77528067352048 \"Learning from failure - The inside story on how IBM out-foxed Intel with the Xbox 360\"], Dean Takahashi, ''Electronic Business'', May 1, 2006</ref>\n\n====Celia Mae====\n'''Celia Mae''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Tilly]]) is a one-eyed monster with [[snake]]-like hair and tentacles for legs. She works as a [[receptionist]] at Monsters, Inc. and is Mike Wazowski's girlfriend. When Mike is at a date with Celia at Harryhausen's, a sushi restaurant,  Boo made herself known as the CDA raid the place and use a device that caused an energy dome that \"decontaminated\" Harryhausen's. Celia was among the monsters who were decontaminated at that time, which then forces her and her snakes hairs to wear neck cones after enduring the decontamination, much to her embarrassment. As a result, Celia is now angry at Mike and she confronts him the next day, and she unintentionally slips Mike's involvement in the incident the previous night while scolding him, which Randall discovers. When Mike and Sulley were being chased by Randall, Celia angrily grabbed onto Mike threatening to break up with him if he did not tell her what was happening; though Mike stated that they are trying to get Boo back to her room, Celia didn't believe him at first until Boo appeared over Sulley's shoulder. Celia does a diversion by announcing that Randall had broken the Scare Record. She is seen again at the end of the film, having fully recovered and made amends with Mike, and tells him that a box full of magazines has just arrived. Both she and Mike are surprised to see that Mike has made the cover of the magazine. During the credits, Celia takes part in Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nDespite not appearing in ''[[Monsters University]]'', Celia is seen in a photo in Mike's locker room, where he puts up a new photo of himself and Sulley in their first day as a Scarer Team, next to Celia's near the end of the movie.\n\n====Jeffrey Fungus====\n'''Jeffrey Fungus''' (voiced by [[Frank Oz]]) is Randall's red-skinned three-eyed assistant. Despite being partnered with Fungus, Randall seems to be annoyed by his antics and would often abuse him and boss him around. Fungus also is terrified by Randall's behavior and his involvement in the plot to kidnap human children and extract their screams forcibly, but feels either blackmailed or too intimidated to confront Randall, and is inwardly glad that Mike and Sulley are sabotaging the sinister conspiracy. When Randall attempts to test the extraction machine on Mike, Sulley puts Fungus on the chair and rescues Mike. The scream machine renders Fungus nearly unconscious and blanches him white,  showing that the machine asphyxiates its victims. In the end following Randall's defeat and Waternoose's arrest, Fungus is forgiven for his involvement and is now happy taking on a job of making children laugh to collect more power.\n\n====Needleman and Smitty====\n'''Needleman and Smitty''' (both voiced by [[Dan Gerson]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]] in ''[[Monsters at Work]]'') are two monsters that work as maintenance and errand monsters at Monsters, Inc.. Both of them worship Sulley and the ground that he walks upon. One of their jobs at Monsters, Inc. is to operate the Door Shredder, a [[woodchipper]]-like device that shreds the doors of children that are not afraid of monsters.\n\nIn one of the outtakes of the film, Smitty accidentally calls Sullivan \"Solomon\", while another outtake sees the Door Shredder shred the door too fast; it later runs backstage with them holding on to it, almost destroying the backstage equipment and props. Needleman and Smitty are also part of the company play, taking the roles as Randall and Fungus respectively.\n\n====Scarers of Scare Floor F====\nThe '''Scarers of Scare Floor F''' are the co-workers at Monsters, Inc.. Apart from James P. Sullivan and Randall Boggs, among these are:\n\n* '''Augustus''' \"'''Spike'''\" '''Jones''' - An red [[slug]]-like monster with tons of retractable purple spikes on his back. In \"Monsters University\", it was shown that Spike had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co.\n* '''Bob Peterson''' (voiced by [[Jack Angel]]) - A light blue [[dinosaur]]-like monster with removable teeth. He is named after [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]].\n* '''George Sanderson''' (voiced by Samuel Lord Black) - A one-horned furry monster who is good friends with Mike, Sulley, Lanky, and Claws. In ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was a member of the Jaws Theta Chi fraternity. In Monsters, Inc., when George emerged from one of the doors with a sock on him, his assistant Charlie sees the sock and shouts \"23-19\" which ended up calling in the CDA to take care of the situation. After the sock is removed and destroyed, George is then shaved, showered, and applied a neck cone to him. This becomes a running gag, as when in the locker room, the toys that Sulley hid in a nearby locker fell on George causing Charlie to shout \"23-19\" which caused the CDA to work on him again. When Charlie picks out a door to a house in the Himalayas, Sulley emerges from it and unknowingly placed a sock on him. Charlie shouts \"23-19\", but this time, George shoved the sock in Charlie's mouth and banished him by throwing him through the door but he escaped through the door and was with George seeing Waternoose being out in the CDA van. \n* '''Harley P. Gerson''' - An orange monster with only a large mouth and two legs.\n* '''Harry''' \"'''Bud'''\" '''Lucky''' - A thin turquoise [[Octopus]] monster with long shaggy purple hair covering his face. \n* '''Joe Ranft''' - A purple monster with huge fists and three eyes.

When interviewed about the \"kid-tastrophe\", he claimed Boo flew over him and used laser vision to blast a car.\n* '''Pete''' \"'''Claws'''\" '''Ward''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]) - A blue [[crocodile]]-like monster with retractable sharp claws and horrifying breath who is good friends with his assistant. When working on one door, he ran out and told his assistant that the child he tried to scare almost touched him resulting in his assistant calling for a door shredder making it the 58th door the company lost this week. He appears to be less fearsome than he tries to make himself look, as he was seen despairing at his aforementioned failed scare attempt and later crying during Mike's solo number in the company play. \n* '''Ricky Plesuski''' - A green monster with a huge mouth filled with sharp teeth, [[snail]]-like eyes, and eight legs. In \"Monsters University\", it is shown that Ricky had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co and Scream Industries.\n* '''Josh Rivera''' (voiced by [[Lee Unkrich]]) - A tall, slender orange monster with six tentacles for arms and four shorter tentacles for legs. \n* '''Theodore''' \"'''Ted'''\" '''Pauley''' (voiced by Katherine Ringgold) - A purple monster with a [[Gorilla]]-like stature and 16 removable eyes.\n\nIn an outtake of the film, as the scarers make their entrance to Scare Floor F, Sulley trips and falls, causing a domino effect where all the other scarers fall as well. After everybody gets tripped over, a crew member peeks his head out clapping the upside-down [[clapperboard]].\n\n====Assistants to the Scarers of Floor F====\n* '''Betty''' (voiced by [[Teresa Ganzel]]) - A light blue monster who is the assistant of Rivera.\n* '''Charlie Proctor''' (voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]) - A blue monster with [[snail]]-like eyes and tentacles for arms that is the assistant of George Sanderson.

Ranft.\n* '''Eric'''  - The assistant of Lucky and is a red Chalooby.\n* '''Jimmy Waxford''' - A five-eyed monster with tentacles for legs that is the assistant of Spike. He was mentioned by Mike as having shifty eyes and was later seen with Randall asking if he knows anything about Boo.\n* '''Zack''' - A 3-eyed [[pistachio]]-like monster who assists Ricky.\n\n====Thaddeus Bile====\n'''Thaddeus Bile''' (voiced by [[Jeff Pidgeon]]) is a trainee Scarer who is also called \"'''Phlegm'''\". He was seen at the beginning of the movie botching his training by leaving the door open as well as being scared by the simulation child (voiced by [[Lisa Raggio]]) causing him to slip on a soccer ball and fall on some jacks. By the end of the film, he begins working on Scare Floor F where he has successfully made a child laugh by slipping on a soccer ball and falling on some jacks again.\n\n====Ms. Linda Flint====\n'''Ms. Linda Flint''' (voiced by [[Bonnie Hunt]]) is an employee at Monsters, Inc. that manages the simulation tests that monsters must pass in order to become scarers. Ms. Flint is a tall, red and black monster with dark red fins attached to her eyes, has long, sharp claws, wears a black jacket and a long, snakelike tail.\n\n===Jerry Slugworth===\n'''Jerry Slugworth''' (voiced by [[Steve Susskind]]) is a red monster with seven fingers who works as a [[Television floor manager|floor manager]] for Scare Floor F.\n\n===Tony===\n'''Tony''' (voiced by [[Guido Quaroni]]) is a tall, slender orange monster with a moustache, two tentacles for arms and four shorter tentacles for legs. He is a [[grocer]] that works at Tony's Grossery and was first seen telling Mike and Sulley that somebody is about to break the All-Scare Record and throws them blood oranges while wishing them the best of luck.\n\n===Ted===\n\n'''Ted''' is the largest monster in the movie; he's so big, only his elephant-like legs, covered with large, coarse brown scales, are shown at all. He also seems to be the only monster that can't talk, instead crowing like a rooster. He is shown at a crossroads waiting for the light to change with Mike and Sulley. Sulley yells \"Good Morning\" up at him, he crows back, then the light turns green, and Ted stumps across the road, causing an earthquake with every step.\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters University''==\n===University staff===\n====Dean Abigail Hardscrabble====\n'''[[Dean (education)|Dean]] Abigail Hardscrabble''' (voiced by [[Helen Mirren]]<ref name=EmpireMirren>{{cite news|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|title=Helen Mirren Set For Monsters University|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=36472|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Empire|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>) is the strict dean of Monsters University. She is a red [[dragon]]-like monster with [[centipede]]-like legs and red [[bat]] wings. She was modeled after a type of centipede called ''[[Scolopendra gigantea]],'' also known as the Amazonian giant centipede. When Dean Hardscrabble attended Monsters University in her youth, she was a member of the Eta Hiss Hiss sorority and is the founder and a four-time consecutive champion of the Scare Games.\n\nShe first appears where she flies into Professor Derek Knight's class at the beginning of the first day. She then also appears during the Scare Exam at the end of the semester that helps to weed out the least-worthy scarers from the University's School of Scaring. Mike was kicked out as Hardscrabble considered him \"not scary\", and Sulley was kicked out when he performed an incorrect scare due to his lack of studying and preparation. Mike later finds out that the only way to get back into the scaring program is to compete in the Scare Games with a fraternity of rejected monsters called Oozma Kappa. As a result, Mike makes a deal with Dean Hardscrabble that if Oozma Kappa wins the Games, they will be reinstated back into the scaring program. Otherwise if they lose, Mike will have to leave the school. Sensing this opportunity, Sulley offers to join in Oozma Kappa allowing the team to gain entry.\n\nDuring the Scare Games, Dean Hardscrabble is secretly watching Mike and Sulley competing from afar, aware and expecting that they are both going to fail. For the Toxicity challenge after Oozma Kappa came in last place, Hardscrabble stated to Mike that only a miracle can save him from expulsion. By coincidence before she could even finish her sentence, one miracle actually happened when Brock Pearson announces that Jaws Theta Chi is disqualified for using an illegal protective sting ointment during the Toxicity challenge which puts Oozma Kappa back into the competition. Dean Hardscrabble then keeps an eye on Oozma Kappa during the remaining challenges.\n\nBut after Oozma Kappa wins the Games when they beat Roar Omega Roar in the final round with the scare simulators, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated by setting Mike's simulator level to easy just to make Oozma Kappa win due to Mike's inability to scare. An outraged Hardscrabble orders him to leave the campus when all of a sudden, she is alerted that Mike had secretly snuck into the door lab, prompting Sulley to go there to save his friend, despite Harscrabble's warnings.\n\nDean Hardscrabble then shuts down the door in question, which led to a cabin at a campsite in a park until the authorities arrive, but Mike and Sulley manage to escape back by scaring several human adults in the form of a team of [[park ranger]]s. Mike's break-in led to him being expelled from Monsters University along with Sulley for rigging a game score, but Hardscrabble was sad to let them go. While considered as a major offense to her school, they ended up surprising her (something which no one has ever done). Dean Hardscrabble had the rest of Oozma Kappa enroll into the Scaring Program, admitting to Sulley and Mike that she was impressed by their performances in the Games.\n\n====Professor Derek Knight====\n'''Professor Derek Knight''' (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]<ref name=DigitalSpyCharacters>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title='Monsters University' unveils character posters, ID cards|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a460540/monsters-university-unveils-character-posters-id-cards.html|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>) is a [[dinosaur]]-like monster who teaches SCARING 101: Intro to Scaring at the School of Scaring. He often weeds out the least worthy students so that the best of the best can move on to becoming Scarers. Professor Knight is also shown to be a fan of Bill Sullivan, Sully's father. When he is first seen during the exam that would determine who will take part in the School of Scaring, Dean Abigail Hardscrabble \"assists\" him where she weeds out Mike for not being scary and Sully for doing an incorrect scare. Professor Knight is later seen with Dean Hardscrabble when Sully admits that he rigged Mike's scare simulator during the final Scare Games event. During the credits, he has a card saying that he worked at Fear. Co.\n\n====Professor William Brandywine====\n'''Professor William Brandywine''' is a round monster with yellow fur whose eyes are invisible.

She is a large [[slug]]-headed teacher with six monstrous tentacles for legs and gray hair. The Librarian is involved in the \"Avoid the Parent\" challenge of the Scare Games where the Librarian's reaction to noise is made to emulate the danger of parents and how a Scarer has to get along without being caught by one. Any team who is caught by the Librarian is thrown out of the library and eliminated from the competition. That is what happened to Slugma Slugma Kappa when they were caught by the Librarian. The Oozma Kappa group gives up on silence after Sulley accidentally knocks over with a ladder and they start a noisy display to distract and confuse the Librarian to get their flag.\n\n===University students===\n====Oozma Kappa students====\n'''Oozma Kappa''' ('''O\u039a''', suggestive of \"[[OK]]\") is one of the six fraternities at Monsters University.

(franchise)|Monsters, Inc.]]'', including the 2001 film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and the 2013 film ''[[Monsters University]]'', and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.\n\n==Setting==\n\n\nThe monster characters reside in the city of Monstropolis. According to a DVD bonus feature, Monstropolis was founded after all of the [[monster]]s who once co-existed with [[human]]s were chased off the mainland and eventually moved to an island on an unknown world where they have lived ever since. The only way for them to enter human-inhabited areas was via closet doors.\n\nThe company Monsters, Inc. provides Monstropolis with power from the screams of human children that have been scared by specialized agents who work for Monsters, Inc. called \"scarers\". There are also companies that rival Monsters, Inc. in this endeavor, such as Fear Co. and Scream Industries.\n\nThe city also provides universities at which monsters can study to scare, the most prominent in the storyline being Monsters University for its outstanding Scaring Program. One of its rivals is a college called Fear Tech.\n\n==Appearing in both films ==\n\n==={{Anchor|James P. Sullivan}}Sulley===\n'''James P. Sullivan''' or '''Sulley''' (voiced by [[John Goodman]] in the film series, [[Brian Cummings]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|''Monsters, Inc.'' video game]], Joel McCrary in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', Christopher Swindle in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a tall blue-furred giant ogre with horns, purple spots, razor-sharp claws on his hands, furry talons for feet, a [[theropod]]-like tail, spikes running down his back and [[shark]]-like fangs. Even though he excels at scaring children, he is kindhearted, thoughtful and affects a relaxed, amiable personality. In the film's beginning, he is \"The Best Scarer\" for several months running.\n\n''[[Monsters University]]'' depicts the college-age Sulley as a talented but lazy student whose father Bill had made a name for himself as a proficient Scarer. He and Mike start as arch-rivals in their introductory scaring class, but eventually form a friendship that lasts even beyond their expulsion from the university.\n\n===Mike Wazowski===\n'''Michael''' \"'''Mike'''\" '''Wazowski''' (voiced by [[Billy Crystal]] in the film series, [[Carlos Alazraqui]] in the video games, Merchandise, attractions and commercials, Noah Johnston as his younger self in ''[[Monsters University]]''), is a one-eyed green monster with a round body and two small horns. He also has claws, but they are not as sharp as Sulley's.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Monsters University]]'', Mike is depicted as a proud monster. Mike had a lonesome childhood and struggled to make friends. On a class field trip to ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Mike was inspired to become a scarer professionally, but other students made fun of him because he was perceived as undeniably \"unscary\".\n\nEven so, Mike was accepted into Monsters University's scare program, where he was introduced to James P. Sullivan in a SCARE 101 class. Mike initially disliked Sulley for his arrogance and bad work ethic. This dislike escalated into a major disruption made in class which resulted in Mike and Sulley's expulsion from the scare program. Mike then works out a deal with the dean of the school to re-enroll in the program on the stipulation that he wins the Games. Sulley joins Mike, despite Mike\u2019s protestations.\n\nMike and Sulley joined the Oozma Kappa fraternity at Monsters University to qualify for the Games. Mike and Sulley begin to build a friendship as they compete together. During the final event, Sulley cheats, and both Mike and Sulley are expelled from school. After being expelled, the two were offered jobs as workers in the Monsters, Inc. mailroom nonetheless. They advance through the ranks until Sully is a scarer and Mike is his assistant. In Monsters, Inc., Mike runs Sulley's station on the scare floor and they are close friends and roommates. Mike is dating Celia Mae at this time. Additionally, Mike helps Sulley in his mission to save Boo.\n\nMike is portrayed as a comedian in [[Tomorrowland]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in [[Walt Disney World Resort]] attraction, [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]]. Mike is not only known for his humor, but also his intelligence. He has made appearances in other Pixar movies, such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mikewazowskimania.weebly.com/|title=Mike Wazowski Mania|website=Mike Wazowski Mania|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Randall Boggs ===\n'''Randall Boggs''' (voiced by [[Steve Buscemi]] in the film series, [[Peter Kelamis]] in the ''Disney Infinity'' video game series, [[J. P. Manoux|J.P. Manoux]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|video game]] and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a purple, eight-legged [[chameleon]]-like monster with an ability to change skin color and blend in with his surroundings. He is very flexible, nimble and is an excellent climber. He is Sulley's nemesis and Mike's arch-rival and former best friend.\n\nIn ''Monsters, Inc.'', he is Sulley's arch-rival on the scare floor, as well as Jeffrey Fungus' boss. The two vie for position as the area's top scream collector, a competition set up to encourage working. Ironically, Randall does manage to win top position for a few seconds, until Sulley comes back from a slumber party, thus winning it back. They also compete for The All-Time Scare Record. Henry J. Waternoose secretly approaches Randall and orders him to build a scream extraction machine, a vacuum-like device, and use it on kidnapped children to save the company and solving the energy crisis at large. One night, Randall leaves a door activated on the Scare Floor, when he was doing a bit of late-night work, and a little girl, later dubbed Boo, wanders out. Randall makes several attempts to get information out of Mike and Sulley on where the kid is. With Waternoose's help, Randall helps banish Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas and kidnap Boo. However, before they could extract the scream from her, Mike and Sulley return and Sulley destroys the machine, rescuing Boo. After a long chase through the millions of doors in the factory's door storage facility, Boo eventually conquers her fear of Randall and buys Sulley enough time to defeat him. Afterwards, Randall is forcibly exiled to the human world and winds up in a mobile home where the inhabitants beat him senseless, believing him to be an alligator. Sulley and Mike then destroy the door to prevent Randall from returning to the monster world.\n\nIn the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Randall enrolls at the same time as Mike and the two end up as friends and roommates. He is insecure and shy at first, having trouble controlling his camouflage abilities, but is a model bookworm. When Randall is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the top fraternity in the university, he quickly abandons Mike in order retain his standing with the fraternity. He slowly becomes more ambitious and confident, and ultimately becomes less empathetic and more self-centered. After an embarrassing failure at the Scare Games to Sulley, an embittered Randall vows to himself to never be outdone by Sulley again, thus starting their unfortunate conflict in Monsters, Inc.\n\n===Roz===\t\n\n'''Roz''' (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]) is a slug-like monster who is the key master and administrator of Scare Floor F. Near the end of the film, she is revealed to be Number One of the CDA, having been on an undercover assignment to investigate the company and expose Randall and Waternoose's scheme.\n\nShe also makes surprise appearances in three outtakes of the film: when Boo is in the toilet cubicle with Sulley, the CDA shaves and showers George Sanderson, and when Sulley proves to Boo that there is no one behind his closet door.\n\nShe appears briefly near the end of the prequel as a member of the CDA squad that responds to the break-in at the Door Lab. Although she wears a full-body protective suit that covers her face, her shape and voice give away her identity.\n\n===CDA===\nThe '''CDA''' (short for '''Child Detection Agency''' and voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Bill Farmer]], [[Pete Docter]], [[Lee Unkrich]], [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and [[Teddy Newton]]) are an assortment of different monsters in [[hazmat suit]]s whose main job is to respond to any reported incidents of contact between monsters and children or their belongings, since it is believed that human objects are toxic. They isolate and destroy any items accidentally brought back into the monster world. Any monsters that comes in contact with a human object are quickly and forcibly decontaminated while having a neck cone applied afterwards.\n\nThey first appear when George Sanderson gets a sock on him and they had to decontaminate him after the sock is destroyed. When Boo gets into Monstropolis and appears at Harryhausen's, the CDA end up decontaminating the building and then disinfected the patrons. They later find the bag containing Boo that Mike and Sulley left behind at the restaurant, which traced them back to Monsters, Inc. where they end up searching the building. In one moment, two of the CDA members ask Sulley for an autograph to give to Bethany, the daughter of agent 00002, whom he mentions. Henry J. Waternoose had the CDA called in to cut the power to Boo's door as soon as it lands so as to contain Boo and arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike does a diversion that involved throwing one of Boo's socks on one of the agents and then had the other agents chase him. This trick enabled the CDA Agents to be present when Henry confesses his motives that involved abducting children to keep Monsters, Inc. alive. The CDA Agents arrest Waternoose as Mike and Sulley discover that Roz is the Number One of the CDA. During the credits, a CDA agent directs a monster to his seat during Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', the CDA are called when Mike and Sulley had entered a door that led to a human area. After Mike and Sulley make it back to Monsters University, they are taken away by the CDA.\n\n===Abominable Snowman===\n\nThe '''[[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) or '''Yeti''', is a white-furred monster from Monstropolis who got banished to the [[Himalayas]] in the human world. He is an expert of making [[snow cone]]s. He greets Sulley and Mike when Waternoose and Randall banish them to the Himalayas. While the Abominable Snowman tries to make Mike and Sulley feel at home in his abode, he understands Sulley must rescue Boo, and tells him of a [[Nepal]]ese village at the foot of the mountain whereupon they can regain access to the monster world. Despite everything, the Abominable Snowman seems to have made the best of his fate and genuinely seems to enjoy the human world.\n\nIn the credits to ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', he appeared as the '''Abominable [[Snowplow]]'''.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was shown to have worked as a [[mailroom]] supervisor at Monsters, Inc.. He warns Mike and Sulley not to mess with the mail which is a crime punished by banishment (which possibly hints why he was banished).\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters, Inc.''==\n===Boo===\n'''Boo''' (voiced by Mary Gibbs) is a 2-year-old human girl who becomes Sulley and Mike's friend.\n\nDuring Randall's secret late-night work on the Scare Floor, Boo gets into the factory and Sulley tries various attempts to put her back, none of which worked, so he eventually puts her inside a [[duffle bag]]. When Sulley brings this up with Mike at Harryhausen's, Boo gets out and frightens the patrons; the CDA have to \"decontaminate\" the restaurant. While Mike and Sulley are at home, they discover that the girl is not toxic after all. Sulley quickly grows attached to the girl and names her \"Boo\". The next day, they smuggle her into the factory disguised as a child of one of Sulley's relatives, and Mike attempts to return her through her door. Randall tries to kidnap Boo, but kidnaps Mike by mistake. Boo may not be afraid of Sulley, but when she was brought into the simulation room after Mike and Sulley escaped from Randall, she ended up severely frightened by Sulley's roar. When Mike and Sulley tried to return Boo to her home, Mr. Waternoose had Mike and Sulley exiled to the Himalayas. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from Randall's Scream Extractor. During the chase through the large storage vault, Boo's laughter ends up causing all the doors to operate. Eventually, Boo gets over being afraid of Randall, and helps to defeat him. Sulley and Mike are able to access Boo's door, but Mr. Waternoose and the CDA send it back to the Scare Floor. Mike distracts the CDA, while Sulley escapes with Boo and her door, although Waternoose follows. The CDA's undercover leader is revealed to be Roz, and she allows Sulley and Mike 5 minutes to return Boo to her world. Once Sulley and Mike have returned Boo to her room, her door is put through the shredder. Sometime later, Mike takes Sulley aside revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door requiring only one more piece which Sulley had taken as a memento, the one taped to his clipboard. Sulley inserts the last piece, reactivates the door and enters to find Boo there.\n\nBoo has had other cameo appearances in other Pixar films including ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.\n\n===Monsters, Inc. employees===\n====Henry J. Waternoose III ====\n'''Henry J. Waternoose III''' (voiced by [[James Coburn]]) is a five-eyed humanoid [[crustacean]]-like monster who is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Monsters, Inc.. The company has been in Waternoose's family for 3 generations as he had inherited the company from his father at the age of 142. Waternoose also previously had a mentoring relationship with Sulley.  The monster wants to be the best one ever. \n\nWaternoose is first seen where he reminds Thaddeus Bile and the other trainees about the dangers of a human child getting into Monstropolis after Thaddeus left the door opened. He has been impressed with Sulley's progress. However, Mr. Waternoose is distraught to learn that the impending energy crisis is increasing, due to many children being desensitized and being unable to be scared by monsters, which might put the company on the verge of being shut down. \n\nWhen Sulley tells Waternoose that he can get the company through the energy crisis, Waternoose tells Sulley to tell that to the [[board of director]]s. When Boo is eventually discovered and Sulley and Mike wanted to return her home, Waternoose agrees to help them, but he later reveals that he and Randall are hand in glove. Waternoose was actually planning to kidnap Boo and several more children to extract their screams to fight the energy crisis and that Randall himself is just an accomplice to Waternoose's plan. \n\nAt that point, Waternoose betrayed both Sulley and Mike by exiling them to the Himalayas to ensure that they don't interfere with their plans any further (as they have found out too much about their scheme), though Waternoose would later regret his actions; he even argues with Randall about how he should not have trusted him since it led to him banishing his top employees in order to prevent them from exposing their scheme to the public. Regardless, Randall tells Waternoose the Scream Extractor would revolutionize Monsters, Inc., that there won't be any need for scarers and that Mike and Sulley \"got what they deserved\". Before Boo's screams can be extracted, Sulley returns and rescues Boo while destroying the machine and using it to pin Randall, Waternoose, and Fungus to the wall (although Randall was quick enough to avoid being trapped) before escaping as Randall gives pursuit. After Sulley and Mike defeat Randall and trap him in the [[Everglades]], Mr. Waternoose has called in the CDA to help apprehend Boo and arrest Sulley and Mike, attempting to frame them as the criminals responsible for the incident. Mike, carrying who they think is Boo, distracts them before running off. While the CDA gave chase to Mike, Sulley ran off with Boo as Waternoose gives chase after they accidentally get his attention. Waternoose follows Sulley to the simulation bedroom before Sulley jams the entrance shut with a metal pipe to hold back Waternoose long enough for Sulley to install Boo's door and supposedly activating it. He eventually manages to break through. In the room, Sulley confronts and argues with Waternoose over his and Randall's wrongdoings. Waternoose declares he will not stop attempting to end the energy crisis, even if it means kidnapping many children and doing away with anyone who stands in his way to ensure that their plot remains a secret. Brutishly knocking Sulley out of his way, he tries to grab Boo from the bed, but instead grabs the simulation child. Just then, the wall goes up to reveal that Mike is behind the controls and he records Sulley and Waternoose's confrontation, exposing Waternoose and Randall's plot as the corruptive CEO watches in shock, now realizing that he had been tricked. With this incriminating evidence and now knowing who the real criminal is, the CDA turns on Waternoose and arrests him. As he is being dragged away, Waternoose yells at Sulley, claiming that he destroyed the company and that the energy crisis will only get worse because of him before he is pulled out of the room. Waternoose is last seen loaded onto the CDA's van and taken to prison for his crimes as Sulley becomes the new CEO of Monsters, Inc., proving Waternoose's theory incorrect by changing the company's approach from scaring to laughter, allowing the company to gain enough power to end the energy crisis for good.\n\nDespite not appearing in the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Waternoose is seen in a photo at the end of the movie shaking hands with Mike and Sulley as they are being promoted to becoming a Scare Team.\n\nThe [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon processor]], used in the [[Xbox 360]], developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]] under the IBM chip program was codenamed \"Waternoose\" in the character's honor.<ref>[https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/learning-failure/77528067352048 \"Learning from failure - The inside story on how IBM out-foxed Intel with the Xbox 360\"], Dean Takahashi, ''Electronic Business'', May 1, 2006</ref>\n\n====Celia Mae====\n'''Celia Mae''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Tilly]]) is a one-eyed monster with [[snake]]-like hair and tentacles for legs. She works as a [[receptionist]] at Monsters, Inc. and is Mike Wazowski's girlfriend. When Mike is at a date with Celia at Harryhausen's, a sushi restaurant,  Boo made herself known as the CDA raid the place and use a device that caused an energy dome that \"decontaminated\" Harryhausen's. Celia was among the monsters who were decontaminated at that time, which then forces her and her snakes hairs to wear neck cones after enduring the decontamination, much to her embarrassment. As a result, Celia is now angry at Mike and she confronts him the next day, and she unintentionally slips Mike's involvement in the incident the previous night while scolding him, which Randall discovers. When Mike and Sulley were being chased by Randall, Celia angrily grabbed onto Mike threatening to break up with him if he did not tell her what was happening; though Mike stated that they are trying to get Boo back to her room, Celia didn't believe him at first until Boo appeared over Sulley's shoulder. Celia does a diversion by announcing that Randall had broken the Scare Record. She is seen again at the end of the film, having fully recovered and made amends with Mike, and tells him that a box full of magazines has just arrived. Both she and Mike are surprised to see that Mike has made the cover of the magazine. During the credits, Celia takes part in Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nDespite not appearing in ''[[Monsters University]]'', Celia is seen in a photo in Mike's locker room, where he puts up a new photo of himself and Sulley in their first day as a Scarer Team, next to Celia's near the end of the movie.\n\n====Jeffrey Fungus====\n'''Jeffrey Fungus''' (voiced by [[Frank Oz]]) is Randall's red-skinned three-eyed assistant. Despite being partnered with Fungus, Randall seems to be annoyed by his antics and would often abuse him and boss him around. Fungus also is terrified by Randall's behavior and his involvement in the plot to kidnap human children and extract their screams forcibly, but feels either blackmailed or too intimidated to confront Randall, and is inwardly glad that Mike and Sulley are sabotaging the sinister conspiracy. When Randall attempts to test the extraction machine on Mike, Sulley puts Fungus on the chair and rescues Mike. The scream machine renders Fungus nearly unconscious and blanches him white,  showing that the machine asphyxiates its victims. In the end following Randall's defeat and Waternoose's arrest, Fungus is forgiven for his involvement and is now happy taking on a job of making children laugh to collect more power.\n\n====Needleman and Smitty====\n'''Needleman and Smitty''' (both voiced by [[Dan Gerson]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]] in ''[[Monsters at Work]]'') are two monsters that work as maintenance and errand monsters at Monsters, Inc.. Both of them worship Sulley and the ground that he walks upon. One of their jobs at Monsters, Inc. is to operate the Door Shredder, a [[woodchipper]]-like device that shreds the doors of children that are not afraid of monsters.\n\nIn one of the outtakes of the film, Smitty accidentally calls Sullivan \"Solomon\", while another outtake sees the Door Shredder shred the door too fast; it later runs backstage with them holding on to it, almost destroying the backstage equipment and props. Needleman and Smitty are also part of the company play, taking the roles as Randall and Fungus respectively.\n\n====Scarers of Scare Floor F====\nThe '''Scarers of Scare Floor F''' are the co-workers at Monsters, Inc.. Apart from James P. Sullivan and Randall Boggs, among these are:\n\n* '''Augustus''' \"'''Spike'''\" '''Jones''' - An red [[slug]]-like monster with tons of retractable purple spikes on his back. In \"Monsters University\", it was shown that Spike had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co.\n* '''Bob Peterson''' (voiced by [[Jack Angel]]) - A light blue [[dinosaur]]-like monster with removable teeth. He is named after [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]].\n* '''George Sanderson''' (voiced by Samuel Lord Black) - A one-horned furry monster who is good friends with Mike, Sulley, Lanky, and Claws. In ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was a member of the Jaws Theta Chi fraternity. In Monsters, Inc., when George emerged from one of the doors with a sock on him, his assistant Charlie sees the sock and shouts \"23-19\" which ended up calling in the CDA to take care of the situation. After the sock is removed and destroyed, George is then shaved, showered, and applied a neck cone to him. This becomes a running gag, as when in the locker room, the toys that Sulley hid in a nearby locker fell on George causing Charlie to shout \"23-19\" which caused the CDA to work on him again. When Charlie picks out a door to a house in the Himalayas, Sulley emerges from it and unknowingly placed a sock on him. Charlie shouts \"23-19\", but this time, George shoved the sock in Charlie's mouth and banished him by throwing him through the door but he escaped through the door and was with George seeing Waternoose being out in the CDA van. \n* '''Harley P. Gerson''' - An orange monster with only a large mouth and two legs.\n* '''Harry''' \"'''Bud'''\" '''Lucky''' - A thin turquoise [[Octopus]] monster with long shaggy purple hair covering his face. \n* '''Joe Ranft''' - A purple monster with huge fists and three eyes. He is named after [[Joe Ranft]].\n* '''Nicholas''' \"'''Lanky'''\" '''Schmidt''' (voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]) - A monster with a small head and long arms and legs who is good friends with Pete \"Claws\" Ward and George Sanderson. When interviewed about the \"kid-tastrophe\", he claimed Boo flew over him and used laser vision to blast a car.\n* '''Pete''' \"'''Claws'''\" '''Ward''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]) - A blue [[crocodile]]-like monster with retractable sharp claws and horrifying breath who is good friends with his assistant. When working on one door, he ran out and told his assistant that the child he tried to scare almost touched him resulting in his assistant calling for a door shredder making it the 58th door the company lost this week. He appears to be less fearsome than he tries to make himself look, as he was seen despairing at his aforementioned failed scare attempt and later crying during Mike's solo number in the company play. \n* '''Ricky Plesuski''' - A green monster with a huge mouth filled with sharp teeth, [[snail]]-like eyes, and eight legs. In \"Monsters University\", it is shown that Ricky had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co and Scream Industries.\n* '''Josh Rivera''' (voiced by [[Lee Unkrich]]) - A tall, slender orange monster with six tentacles for arms and four shorter tentacles for legs. \n* '''Theodore''' \"'''Ted'''\" '''Pauley''' (voiced by Katherine Ringgold) - A purple monster with a [[Gorilla]]-like stature and 16 removable eyes.\n\nIn an outtake of the film, as the scarers make their entrance to Scare Floor F, Sulley trips and falls, causing a domino effect where all the other scarers fall as well. After everybody gets tripped over, a crew member peeks his head out clapping the upside-down [[clapperboard]].\n\n====Assistants to the Scarers of Floor F====\n* '''Betty''' (voiced by [[Teresa Ganzel]]) - A light blue monster who is the assistant of Rivera.\n* '''Charlie Proctor''' (voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]) - A blue monster with [[snail]]-like eyes and tentacles for arms that is the assistant of George Sanderson. He would often freak out whenever a human object would come in contact with George, leading to the latter's forcible decontamination by the CDA.\n* '''Chuck''' (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]) - A pink [[frog]]-like monster with four arms and also assists Claws Ward.\n* '''Stuart''' - A turquoise monster with [[crab]]-like legs and a stalk with one eye who assists Harley Gerson.\n*'''Frank''' (voiced by [[Paul Eiding]]) - A one-eyed four-armed green monster with no visible mouth that has a ruff of fur around his stalk. He also assists Bob Peterston.\n* '''Kevin''' - The assistant of Ted Pauley and is a yellow Chalooby.\n* '''Marge''' - (voiced by Mickie McGowan) The assistant of Schmidt and a [[starfish]]-like monster.\n* '''Glenn''' - A light green [[gracility|slender]] monster with around 4 or 5 legs who assists Joe J.J. Ranft.\n* '''Eric'''  - The assistant of Lucky and is a red Chalooby.\n* '''Jimmy Waxford''' - A five-eyed monster with tentacles for legs that is the assistant of Spike. He was mentioned by Mike as having shifty eyes and was later seen with Randall asking if he knows anything about Boo.\n* '''Zack''' - A 3-eyed [[pistachio]]-like monster who assists Ricky.\n\n====Thaddeus Bile====\n'''Thaddeus Bile''' (voiced by [[Jeff Pidgeon]]) is a trainee Scarer who is also called \"'''Phlegm'''\". He was seen at the beginning of the movie botching his training by leaving the door open as well as being scared by the simulation child (voiced by [[Lisa Raggio]]) causing him to slip on a soccer ball and fall on some jacks. By the end of the film, he begins working on Scare Floor F where he has successfully made a child laugh by slipping on a soccer ball and falling on some jacks again.\n\n====Ms. Linda Flint====\n'''Ms. Linda Flint''' (voiced by [[Bonnie Hunt]]) is an employee at Monsters, Inc. that manages the simulation tests that monsters must pass in order to become scarers. Ms. Flint is a tall, red and black monster with dark red fins attached to her eyes, has long, sharp claws, wears a black jacket and a long, snakelike tail.\n\n===Jerry Slugworth===\n'''Jerry Slugworth''' (voiced by [[Steve Susskind]]) is a red monster with seven fingers who works as a [[Television floor manager|floor manager]] for Scare Floor F.\n\n===Tony===\n'''Tony''' (voiced by [[Guido Quaroni]]) is a tall, slender orange monster with a moustache, two tentacles for arms and four shorter tentacles for legs. He is a [[grocer]] that works at Tony's Grossery and was first seen telling Mike and Sulley that somebody is about to break the All-Scare Record and throws them blood oranges while wishing them the best of luck.\n\n===Ted===\n\n'''Ted''' is the largest monster in the movie; he's so big, only his elephant-like legs, covered with large, coarse brown scales, are shown at all. He also seems to be the only monster that can't talk, instead crowing like a rooster. He is shown at a crossroads waiting for the light to change with Mike and Sulley. Sulley yells \"Good Morning\" up at him, he crows back, then the light turns green, and Ted stumps across the road, causing an earthquake with every step.\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters University''==\n===University staff===\n====Dean Abigail Hardscrabble====\n'''[[Dean (education)|Dean]] Abigail Hardscrabble''' (voiced by [[Helen Mirren]]<ref name=EmpireMirren>{{cite news|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|title=Helen Mirren Set For Monsters University|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=36472|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Empire|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>) is the strict dean of Monsters University. She is a red [[dragon]]-like monster with [[centipede]]-like legs and red [[bat]] wings. She was modeled after a type of centipede called ''[[Scolopendra gigantea]],'' also known as the Amazonian giant centipede. When Dean Hardscrabble attended Monsters University in her youth, she was a member of the Eta Hiss Hiss sorority and is the founder and a four-time consecutive champion of the Scare Games.\n\nShe first appears where she flies into Professor Derek Knight's class at the beginning of the first day. She then also appears during the Scare Exam at the end of the semester that helps to weed out the least-worthy scarers from the University's School of Scaring. Mike was kicked out as Hardscrabble considered him \"not scary\", and Sulley was kicked out when he performed an incorrect scare due to his lack of studying and preparation. Mike later finds out that the only way to get back into the scaring program is to compete in the Scare Games with a fraternity of rejected monsters called Oozma Kappa. As a result, Mike makes a deal with Dean Hardscrabble that if Oozma Kappa wins the Games, they will be reinstated back into the scaring program. Otherwise if they lose, Mike will have to leave the school. Sensing this opportunity, Sulley offers to join in Oozma Kappa allowing the team to gain entry.\n\nDuring the Scare Games, Dean Hardscrabble is secretly watching Mike and Sulley competing from afar, aware and expecting that they are both going to fail. For the Toxicity challenge after Oozma Kappa came in last place, Hardscrabble stated to Mike that only a miracle can save him from expulsion. By coincidence before she could even finish her sentence, one miracle actually happened when Brock Pearson announces that Jaws Theta Chi is disqualified for using an illegal protective sting ointment during the Toxicity challenge which puts Oozma Kappa back into the competition. Dean Hardscrabble then keeps an eye on Oozma Kappa during the remaining challenges.\n\nBut after Oozma Kappa wins the Games when they beat Roar Omega Roar in the final round with the scare simulators, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated by setting Mike's simulator level to easy just to make Oozma Kappa win due to Mike's inability to scare. An outraged Hardscrabble orders him to leave the campus when all of a sudden, she is alerted that Mike had secretly snuck into the door lab, prompting Sulley to go there to save his friend, despite Harscrabble's warnings.\n\nDean Hardscrabble then shuts down the door in question, which led to a cabin at a campsite in a park until the authorities arrive, but Mike and Sulley manage to escape back by scaring several human adults in the form of a team of [[park ranger]]s. Mike's break-in led to him being expelled from Monsters University along with Sulley for rigging a game score, but Hardscrabble was sad to let them go. While considered as a major offense to her school, they ended up surprising her (something which no one has ever done). Dean Hardscrabble had the rest of Oozma Kappa enroll into the Scaring Program, admitting to Sulley and Mike that she was impressed by their performances in the Games.\n\n====Professor Derek Knight====\n'''Professor Derek Knight''' (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]<ref name=DigitalSpyCharacters>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title='Monsters University' unveils character posters, ID cards|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a460540/monsters-university-unveils-character-posters-id-cards.html|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>) is a [[dinosaur]]-like monster who teaches SCARING 101: Intro to Scaring at the School of Scaring. He often weeds out the least worthy students so that the best of the best can move on to becoming Scarers. Professor Knight is also shown to be a fan of Bill Sullivan, Sully's father. When he is first seen during the exam that would determine who will take part in the School of Scaring, Dean Abigail Hardscrabble \"assists\" him where she weeds out Mike for not being scary and Sully for doing an incorrect scare. Professor Knight is later seen with Dean Hardscrabble when Sully admits that he rigged Mike's scare simulator during the final Scare Games event. During the credits, he has a card saying that he worked at Fear. Co.\n\n====Professor William Brandywine====\n'''Professor William Brandywine''' is a round monster with yellow fur whose eyes are invisible. He works at Monsters University's School of Engineering where he teaches Scream Canister Designs to his students. Don Carlton's character model was used to make Professor Brandywine.\n\n====Librarian====\nThe '''[[Librarian]]''' (voiced by [[Marcia Wallace]]) is an elderly female monster that works at the library at Monsters University. She is a large [[slug]]-headed teacher with six monstrous tentacles for legs and gray hair. The Librarian is involved in the \"Avoid the Parent\" challenge of the Scare Games where the Librarian's reaction to noise is made to emulate the danger of parents and how a Scarer has to get along without being caught by one. Any team who is caught by the Librarian is thrown out of the library and eliminated from the competition. That is what happened to Slugma Slugma Kappa when they were caught by the Librarian. The Oozma Kappa group gives up on silence after Sulley accidentally knocks over with a ladder and they start a noisy display to distract and confuse the Librarian to get their flag.\n\n===University students===\n====Oozma Kappa students====\n'''Oozma Kappa''' ('''O\u039a''', suggestive of \"[[OK]]\") is one of the six fraternities at Monsters University.

The female students here - aside from being near identical to each other with minor color differences - are smart, frozen-hearted, and merciless. Every time they get announced or tell Oozma Kappa they're \"going to rip them to pieces\", they all hiss and their eyes glow even in the dark. In the Scare Games, Python Nu Kappa was eliminated after they got lost in the maze and accidentally scared teenagers during the \"Don't Scare the Teen\" event. According to the \"Monsters University Essential Guide\", all of the members of Python Nu Kappa want to work at a [[crematorium]].

Although eight-part scoring was fairly common for [[serenade]]s and [[Divertimento|divertimenti]] in the 18th century, the word \"octet\" only first appeared at the beginning of the 19th century, as the title of a composition by [[Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia (1772\u20131806)|Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia]], whose Octet Op. 12 (published posthumously in 1808) features the piano, together with clarinet, 2 horns, 2 violins, and 2 cellos. Later octets with piano were written by [[Ferdinand Ries]] (Op. 128, 1818, with clarinet, horn, bassoon, violin, viola, cello, and double bass), [[Anton Rubinstein]] (Op. 9, 1856, with flute, clarinet, horn, violin, viola, cello, and double bass), and [[Paul Juon]] (Chamber Symphony, Op. 27, 1907) {{harv|Kube|2001}}.\n\nOctets tend to be scored in one of the following arrangements:\n\n* String octet \u2013 This arrangement is made up entirely of strings. [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[Octet (Mendelssohn)|Octet Op. 20]] is an example, as are the octets of [[Octet (Enescu)|George Enescu]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].\n** Double quartet \u2013 Double quartets are made up of two [[string quartet]]s, often arranged [[antiphony|antiphonally]]. [[Louis Spohr]] composed four such octets between 1823 and 1847 (opp. 65, 77, 87 and 136), taking as a model a work by [[Andreas Romberg]]. Later examples in this mode include works by [[Nikolay Afanasyev (composer)|Nikolay Afanasyev]] (''Housewarming'' and ''Le souvenir'') and Mario Peragallo (''Music for Double Quartet'', 1948), as well as [[Darius Milhaud]]'s paired 14th and 15th String Quartets Op. 291 (1948\u201349), which are composed to be playable simultaneously as an octet {{harv|Kube|2001}}.\n** Cello octet \u2013 Eight cellos, a combination popularized by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] in his ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]'' nos. 1 (1930) and 5 (1938/1945), though technically these are for \"cello orchestra\" with a minimum of eight players. Villa-Lobos also arranged three of the preludes and four fugues from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier|Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' for this ensemble. Several all-cello groups came into existence during the late 1970s and 1980s, notably the [[Yale Cellos]], [[The 12 cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic|the 12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic]], and the Conjunto Ib\u00e9rico cello octet, and their popularity caused a surge of interest in cello-ensemble writing among composers. Some of the most prominent to compose cello octets include [[Luciano Berio]] (''Kor\u00f3t'', 1998), [[Sylvano Bussotti]] (''Po\u00e8sies \u00e0 Maldoror'', 1999), [[Edison Denisov]] (''Hymne'', 1995), [[Morton Gould]] (''Cellos'', 1984), [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (''Fata morgana: die tanzende Sonne'', 2002), [[Gordon Jacob]] (Cello Octet, 1981), [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]] (version of ''[[Fratres]]'', (1983), [[Steve Reich]] (''[[Cello Counterpoint]]'', 2003), [[Kaija Saariaho]] (''Neiges'', 1998), and [[Peter Sculthorpe]] (''Chorale'', 1994).\n* Wind octet \u2013 Usually scored for 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[Natural horn|horn]]s, and 2 [[bassoon]]s; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] composed for this scoring, also known as [[Harmonie]] {{harv|Montagu|2002}}, though only Beethoven actually titled his one work for this grouping \"[[Octet (Beethoven)|Octet]]\". The octets of [[Franz Lachner]] ([[Octet (Lachner)|Op. 156]]), [[Theodore Gouvy]] (Op. 71) and [[Carl Reinecke]] ([[Octet (Reinecke)|Op. 216]]) are scored for flute, oboe, 2 clarinets, 2 horns and 2 bassoons.  [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] for wind instruments has an unusual scoring of [[flute]], clarinet, two bassoons, two [[trumpet]]s, and two [[trombone]]s. [[George Antheil]]'s Concerto for Chamber Orchestra is scored for an octet of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, contrabassoon, horn, trumpet and trombone.\n* Wind and string octet \u2013 a combination of forces, popularized by [[Franz Schubert]] (whose [[Octet (Schubert)|Octet]] is for clarinet, bassoon, [[Natural horn|horn]], 2 [[violin]]s, [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]]). A number of ensembles have been formed with this instrumentation, including the Octuor de Paris, for whom [[Iannis Xenakis]] composed ''Anaktoria'' (1969). By contrast, the Octet by [[Louis Spohr]] is scored for clarinet, 2 horns, violin, 2 violas, cello, and double bass. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote a less well-known piece for clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, two violas, cello and double bass. Another important 20th-century octet for winds and strings is ''[[Octandre]]'' by [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] (1923), for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe, clarinet (doubling E{{Music|flat}} clarinet), bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, and double bass {{harv|Griffiths|2001}}. [[Alec Wilder]] composed a series of crossover octets between 1938 and 1940 which are scored for a quintet of woodwinds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon) backed by a rhythm section of harpsichord, double bass and drums.\n\n==Octets in jazz==\n[[File:Aman octet.JPG|thumb|The Aman jazz octet]]\nJazz ensembles of eight players will frequently be termed an octet. These ensembles may be for any combination of instruments, but the most common line-up is [[trumpet]], [[alto sax]], [[tenor sax]], [[trombone]], [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[Double bass|bass]] and [[drums]], with guitar occasionally making way for another horn, for example [[baritone sax]]. The Jamil Sheriff Octet [http://www.myspace.com/thejamilsheriffoctet] is an example of a classic octet. [[Ornette Coleman]]'s ensemble for the ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'' album (referred to as a double quartet) is an example of two quartets playing together at the same time.\n\nSaxophonist [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]] leads an experimental jazz octet, the David Murray Octet.\n\nThe collaborations of trombonists [[J.J. Johnson]] and [[Kai Winding]] occasionally featured a trombone octet, most notably on their 1956 record [[Jay and Kai + 6]].\n\n==Octets in popular music==\n*British pop group [[the Dooleys]] were an eight-member group popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n*British rock group [[Yes (band)|Yes]] were an eight-member group during their ''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' tour in 1991.\n\n==Vocal octet==\nA vocal octet is a choir, or performance by a choir,{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} of eight separate parts, for example, an SSAATTBB (1st & 2nd [[soprano]], 1st & 2nd [[alto]], 1st & 2nd [[tenor]], [[baritone]] and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]) choir.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Silesian Guitar Octet]]\n*[[:pl:Oktet wokalny \"OCTAVA\"|Vocal octet OCTAVA]]\n*[[Los Angeles Electric 8]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Griffiths|2001}}|reference=Griffiths, Paul. 2001. \"Var\u00e8se, Edgard [Edgar] (Victor Achille Charles)\".

[[Paul Hindemith]] wrote a less well-known piece for clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, two violas, cello and double bass. Another important 20th-century octet for winds and strings is ''[[Octandre]]'' by [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] (1923), for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe, clarinet (doubling E{{Music|flat}} clarinet), bassoon, horn, trumpet, trombone, and double bass {{harv|Griffiths|2001}}. [[Alec Wilder]] composed a series of crossover octets between 1938 and 1940 which are scored for a quintet of woodwinds (flute, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon) backed by a rhythm section of harpsichord, double bass and drums.\n\n==Octets in jazz==\n[[File:Aman octet.JPG|thumb|The Aman jazz octet]]\nJazz ensembles of eight players will frequently be termed an octet. These ensembles may be for any combination of instruments, but the most common line-up is [[trumpet]], [[alto sax]], [[tenor sax]], [[trombone]], [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[Double bass|bass]] and [[drums]], with guitar occasionally making way for another horn, for example [[baritone sax]]. The Jamil Sheriff Octet [http://www.myspace.com/thejamilsheriffoctet] is an example of a classic octet. [[Ornette Coleman]]'s ensemble for the ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'' album (referred to as a double quartet) is an example of two quartets playing together at the same time.\n\nSaxophonist [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]] leads an experimental jazz octet, the David Murray Octet.\n\nThe collaborations of trombonists [[J.J. Johnson]] and [[Kai Winding]] occasionally featured a trombone octet, most notably on their 1956 record [[Jay and Kai + 6]].\n\n==Octets in popular music==\n*British pop group [[the Dooleys]] were an eight-member group popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n*British rock group [[Yes (band)|Yes]] were an eight-member group during their ''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' tour in 1991.\n\n==Vocal octet==\nA vocal octet is a choir, or performance by a choir,{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} of eight separate parts, for example, an SSAATTBB (1st & 2nd [[soprano]], 1st & 2nd [[alto]], 1st & 2nd [[tenor]], [[baritone]] and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]) choir.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Silesian Guitar Octet]]\n*[[:pl:Oktet wokalny \"OCTAVA\"|Vocal octet OCTAVA]]\n*[[Los Angeles Electric 8]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Griffiths|2001}}|reference=Griffiths, Paul. 2001. \"Var\u00e8se, Edgard [Edgar] (Victor Achille Charles)\".

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nAccording to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nThe base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.\n\nIts secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component\u2014the so-called [[S-box]]es\u2014had been altered to insert a \"[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]\" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power.

An attack for SHA-0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers.

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nAccording to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nThe base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.\n\nIts secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component\u2014the so-called [[S-box]]es\u2014had been altered to insert a \"[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]\" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against [[differential cryptanalysis]], a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the IBM DES team.\n\n=== Advanced Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}\nThe involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), was limited to hardware performance testing (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES competition]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hardware Performance Simulations of Round 2 Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithms|author=Weeks, Bryan|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=June 29, 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024234406/http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA-approved systems.<ref name=\"suiteB\">\"the NIST standards that define Suite B...\" in {{cite web|title=Suite B Cryptography / Cryptographic Interoperability|url=https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=June 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101091229/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== NSA encryption systems ===\n[[File:STU-IIIphones.nsa.jpg|thumb|[[STU-III]] secure telephones on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]]]]\n{{Main|NSA encryption systems}}\n\nThe NSA is responsible for the encryption-related components in these legacy systems:\n* [[FNBDT]] Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal<ref>{{cite book|title=C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups|author=Committee on C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups, National Research Council|isbn=978-0-309-09600-3|publisher=National Academies Press |year=2006|page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NByKhCK3edkC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167}}</ref>\n* [[KL-7]] ADONIS off-line rotor encryption machine (post-WWII \u2013 1980s)<ref>\"Adkins Family asked for a pic of the KL-7.

Bush]], the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining [[warrant (law)|warrants]] from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a secret court created for that purpose under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA).<ref name=\"NYTWarrantless\">[[James Risen]] & [[Eric Lichtblau]] (December 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nOne such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion.

In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]], although the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ''[[ACLU v.
