The episode was written by [[Dan Greaney]] and directed by Matt Sohn. It originally aired on [[NBC]] on January 17, 2013.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, Clark returns from his stint as Jan's sexual assistant and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) enlists his help; the two pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the owner of a suit warehouse. [[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) travels to Philadelphia with [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) to interview at Jim's new company. Meanwhile, Pam starts to realize that her family may have to leave Scranton.\n\n\"Suit Warehouse\" received mainly positive reviews from critics. The episode was also viewed by 4.15 million viewers and received a 2.1/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, ranking second in its timeslot. The episode ultimately ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Darryl Philbin]] ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) is off to [[Philadelphia]] to interview at [[Jim Halpert]]'s ([[John Krasinski]]) new company, Athlead, and [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) decides to come along, since office manager [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) to take care of a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.\n\nOn the drive to Athlead, Darryl opens up to Pam that he is worried about the interview. At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says \"Jim speaks about you all the time\" and we \"can't wait for you to move here.\" The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy, but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although he will have to pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future.\n\nAt [[Dunder Mifflin]], [[Clark Green]] ([[Clark Duke]]) returns from his stint as [[Jan Levinson]]'s ([[Melora Hardin]]) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward past couple of weeks, Jan has gifted them an [[espresso]] machine, and the rest of the office jumps on the opportunity to 'test' out several espresso flavors. [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark Sam Stone Sr. ([[Ed Lauter]]), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at Sam Stone Jr. (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.\n\nBack at the office, the staff have drunk multiple cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush along with a powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, try to relocate the copy machine and frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are bewildered by the sight they encounter, and on her way out, Erin explains that it was because Pam left her in charge of the pens.\n\n==Production==\n\"Suit Warehouse\" was written by consulting producer [[Dan Greaney]], his second writing credit for the series, after \"[[Mrs. California]]\".<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Mrs. California | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | credits =  [[Dan Greaney]] (writer); [[Charlie Grandy]] (director) | network = NBC | airdate = January 10, 2013 | season = 8 | number = 9}}</ref><ref name=\"suitwarehouse\">{{Cite episode | title = Suit Warehouse | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | credits =  [[Dan Greaney]] (writer); Matt Sohn (director) | network = NBC | airdate = January 17, 2013 | season = 9 | number = 11}}</ref> The episode was also directed by Matt Sohn, his seventh directorial effort for the series, following the ninth season entry, \"[[Roy's Wedding]]\".<ref name=\"suitwarehouse\"/> The episode features the return of series regular Clark Duke, having previously left for several episodes in order to film ''[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick-Ass 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Houx|first=Damon|title='The Office' Review: 'Dwight Christmas'|url=http://screencrush.com/the-office-review-dwight-christmas/|publisher=Screen Crush|accessdate=December 7, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> The episode is the fourth not to feature [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]).

[[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark Sam Stone Sr. ([[Ed Lauter]]), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at Sam Stone Jr. (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.\n\nBack at the office, the staff have drunk multiple cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush along with a powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, try to relocate the copy machine and frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are bewildered by the sight they encounter.\n\n==Production==\n\"Suit Warehouse\" was written by consulting producer [[Dan Greaney]], his second writing credit for the series, after \"[[Mrs. California]]\".<ref>{{Cite episode | title = Mrs. California | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | credits =  [[Dan Greaney]] (writer); [[Charlie Grandy]] (director) | network = NBC | airdate = January 10, 2013 | season = 8 | number = 9}}</ref><ref name=\"suitwarehouse\">{{Cite episode | title = Suit Warehouse | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | credits =  [[Dan Greaney]] (writer); Matt Sohn (director) | network = NBC | airdate = January 17, 2013 | season = 9 | number = 11}}</ref> The episode was also directed by Matt Sohn, his seventh directorial effort for the series, following the ninth season entry, \"[[Roy's Wedding]]\".<ref name=\"suitwarehouse\"/> The episode features the return of series regular Clark Duke, having previously left for several episodes in order to film ''[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick-Ass 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Houx|first=Damon|title='The Office' Review: 'Dwight Christmas'|url=http://screencrush.com/the-office-review-dwight-christmas/|publisher=Screen Crush|accessdate=December 7, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> The episode is the fourth not to feature [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]).

All these patterns answer some [[software]] problems, and these problems are common to almost every [[software development]] project. These techniques have not been invented to create new ways of working, but to better document and standardize old, tried-and-tested [[Computer programming|programming]] principles in object-oriented design. \n\nComputer scientist [[Craig Larman]] states that \"the critical design tool for software development is a mind well educated in design principles. It is not [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or any other technology.\"{{sfn|Larman|2005|p = 272}} Thus, GRASP are really a mental toolset, a learning aid to help in the design of object-oriented software.\n\n== Patterns ==\nIn OO design, a pattern is a named description of a problem and solution that can be applied in new contexts; ideally, a pattern advises us on how to apply its solution in varying circumstances and considers the forces and trade-offs. Many patterns, given a specific category of problem, guide the assignment of responsibilities to objects. \n\n=== Controller ===\n\nThe '''controller''' pattern assigns the responsibility of dealing with system events to a non-[[User Interface|UI]] class that represents the overall system or a [[use case]] scenario. A controller object is a non-user interface object responsible for receiving or handling a system event.\n\nA use case controller should be used to deal with ''all'' system events of a use case, and may be used for more than one use case. For instance, for the use cases ''Create User'' and ''Delete User'', one can have a single class called ''UserController'', instead of two separate use case controllers.\n\nThe controller is defined as the first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates (\"controls\") a system operation. The controller should delegate the work that needs to be done to other objects; it coordinates or controls the activity. It should not do much work itself. The GRASP Controller can be thought of as being a part of the application/service layer<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/domaindrivendesign/conversations/messages/7582 |title=Application Layer like business facade? |work=Yahoo! Groups (domaindrivendesign) |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> (assuming that the application has made an explicit distinction between the application/service layer and the [[domain layer]]) in an object-oriented system with common layers in an information system logical architecture.\n\n===Creator===\n{{see also|Factory pattern}}\nCreation of objects is one of the most common activities in an object-oriented system. Which class is responsible for creating objects is a fundamental property of the relationship between objects of particular classes.\n \nIn general, a class <code>B</code> should be responsible for creating instances of class <code>A</code> if one, or preferably more, of the following apply:\n* Instances of <code>B</code> contain or compositely aggregate instances of <code>A</code>\n* Instances of <code>B</code> record instances of <code>A</code>\n* Instances of <code>B</code> closely use instances of <code>A</code>\n* Instances of <code>B</code> have the initializing information for instances of <code>A</code> and pass it on creation.\n{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Indirection===\nThe indirection pattern supports low coupling and reuse potential between two elements by assigning the responsibility of mediation between them to an intermediate object. An example of this is the introduction of a controller component for mediation between data (model) and its representation (view) in the model-view control pattern. This ensures that coupling between them remains low.\n\n===Information expert===\n{{see also|Information hiding}}\n'''Information expert''' (also '''expert''' or the '''expert principle''') is a principle used to determine where to delegate responsibilities such as methods, computed fields, and so on. \n\nUsing the principle of information expert, a general approach to assigning responsibilities is to look at a given responsibility, determine the information needed to fulfill it, and then determine where that information is stored. \n\nThis will lead to placing the responsibility on the class with the most information required to fulfill it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Larman|2005}} chapter 17, section 11.</ref>\n\n===High cohesion===\n{{main|Cohesion (computer science)}}\n'''High cohesion''' is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and highly focused. Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities that increase the cohesive properties of a system. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. Elements with low cohesion often suffer from being hard to comprehend, reuse, maintain and change.<ref name=\"larman314\">{{Harvnb|Larman|2005|pp=314&ndash;315}}.</ref>\n\n===Low coupling===\n{{main|Loose coupling}}\nCoupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. '''Low coupling''' is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities for the following benefits:\n* lower dependency between the classes,\n* change in one class having lower impact on other classes,\n* higher reuse potential.\n\n===Polymorphism===\n{{main|Polymorphism in object-oriented programming}}\nAccording to the '''polymorphism''' principle, responsibility for defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens. This is achieved using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] operations. The user of the type should use polymorphic operations instead of explicit branching based on type.\n\n===Protected variations===\n{{see also|Open/closed principle}}\nThe '''protected variations''' pattern protects elements from the variations on other elements (objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] and using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] to create various implementations of this interface.\n\n===Pure fabrication===\n{{see also|Service (systems architecture)}}\nA '''pure fabrication''' is a class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve low coupling, high cohesion, and the reuse potential thereof derived (when a solution presented by the ''information expert'' pattern does not). This kind of class is called a \"service\" in [[domain-driven design]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anemic domain model]]\n* [[Design pattern (computer science)]]\n* [[Design Patterns (book)]]\n* [[SOLID (object-oriented design)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Larman|first=Craig|authorlink=Craig Larman\n|title=Applying UML and Patterns &ndash; An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development\n|origyear=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]\n|year=2005\n|isbn=0-13-148906-2\n|location=New Jersey\n|url=http://authors.phptr.com/larman/uml_ooad/index.html\n|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n<!-- [[pt:GRASP]] The Portuguese article named 'GRASP' does not refer to this subject.

The controller should delegate the work that needs to be done to other objects; it coordinates or controls the activity. It should not do much work itself. The GRASP Controller can be thought of as being a part of the application/service layer<ref>{{cite web |url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/domaindrivendesign/conversations/messages/7582 |title=Application Layer like business facade? |work=Yahoo! Groups (domaindrivendesign) |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> (assuming that the application has made an explicit distinction between the application/service layer and the [[domain layer]]) in an object-oriented system with common layers in an information system logical architecture.\n\n===Creator===\n{{see also|Factory pattern}}\nCreation of objects is one of the most common activities in an object-oriented system. Which class is responsible for creating objects is a fundamental property of the relationship between objects of particular classes.\n \nIn general, a class <code>B</code> should be responsible for creating instances of class <code>A</code> if one, or preferably more, of the following apply:\n* Instances of <code>B</code> contain or compositely aggregate instances of <code>A</code>\n* Instances of <code>B</code> record instances of <code>A</code>\n* Instances of <code>B</code> closely use instances of <code>A</code>\n* Instances of <code>B</code> have the initializing information for instances of <code>A</code> and pass it on creation.\n{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Indirection===\nThe indirection pattern supports low coupling and reuse potential between two elements by assigning the responsibility of mediation between them to an intermediate object. An example of this is the introduction of a controller component for mediation between data (model) and its representation (view) in the model-view control pattern. This ensures that coupling between them remains low.\n\n===Information expert===\n{{see also|Information hiding}}\n'''Information expert''' (also '''expert''' or the '''expert principle''') is a principle used to determine where to delegate responsibilities such as methods, computed fields, and so on. \n\nUsing the principle of information expert, a general approach to assigning responsibilities is to look at a given responsibility, determine the information needed to fulfill it, and then determine where that information is stored. \n\nThis will lead to placing the responsibility on the class with the most information required to fulfill it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Larman|2005}} chapter 17, section 11.</ref>\n\n===High cohesion===\n{{main|Cohesion (computer science)}}\n'''High cohesion''' is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and highly focused. Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities that increase the cohesive properties of a system. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. Elements with low cohesion often suffer from being hard to comprehend, reuse, maintain and change.<ref name=\"larman314\">{{Harvnb|Larman|2005|pp=314&ndash;315}}.</ref>\n\n===Low coupling===\n{{main|Loose coupling}}\nCoupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. '''Low coupling''' is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities for the following benefits:\n* lower dependency between the classes,\n* change in one class having lower impact on other classes,\n* higher reuse potential.\n\n===Polymorphism===\n{{main|Polymorphism in object-oriented programming}}\nAccording to the '''polymorphism''' principle, responsibility for defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens. This is achieved using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] operations. The user of the type should use polymorphic operations instead of explicit branching based on type.\n\n===Protected variations===\n{{see also|Open/closed principle}}\nThe '''protected variations''' pattern protects elements from the variations on other elements (objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] and using [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] to create various implementations of this interface.\n\n===Pure fabrication===\n{{see also|Service (systems architecture)}}\nA '''pure fabrication''' is a class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve low coupling, high cohesion, and the reuse potential thereof derived (when a solution presented by the ''information expert'' pattern does not). This kind of class is called a \"service\" in [[domain-driven design]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anemic domain model]]\n* [[Design pattern (computer science)]]\n* [[Design Patterns (book)]]\n* [[SOLID (object-oriented design)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n|last=Larman|first=Craig|authorlink=Craig Larman\n|title=Applying UML and Patterns &ndash; An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development\n|origyear=2004\n|edition=3rd\n|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]\n|year=2005\n|isbn=0-13-148906-2\n|location=New Jersey\n|url=http://authors.phptr.com/larman/uml_ooad/index.html\n|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n<!-- [[pt:GRASP]] The Portuguese article named 'GRASP' does not refer to this subject.

It was officially released worldwide on November 1, 2007 from the Angels & Airwaves website, where it was available for download. It was then released on CD on November 5 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and on November 6 in the United States and Canada. It is their first album to feature [[Matt Wachter]] on bass.\n\n==Production==\nAngels & Airwaves started work on ''I-Empire'' in the beginning of 2007. It was the first album ever recorded at Jupiter Sound (Macbeth's studio).\n\nOn May 20, 2007, in an interview with Alternative Radio, the band said that the album was 60-70% complete and that the record would be out in October or November 2007. DeLonge also stated that the album would continue the element of the first album, but \"times ten\" and that in a story, ''I-Empire'' would follow ''We Don't Need to Whisper''; ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' being a \"re-birth\" of life, and ''I-Empire'' being an album about what you do after the rebirth. It has a slightly more mellow, ambient tone with lyrics focusing more on relationships and less about war and conflict.\n\nOn May 30, 2007, DeLonge stated in an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' that the new album would be named ''I-Empire'' and \"this is as exciting as rock 'n' roll gets!\"\n\nOn July 29, 2007, as a part of the 'Everybody Hurts' tour, Angels & Airwaves played the studio versions of four new songs from ''I-Empire'' to their fans. The songs played were \"Secret Crowds\", \"Sirens\", \"Lifeline\", and \"[[Everything's Magic]]\", along with live acoustic performances of \"Everything's Magic\", \"The Gift\", \"Good Day\", \"Do It for Me Now\", and \"The Adventure\". These songs were all recorded and leaked onto the internet, giving fans their first glimpse of ''I-Empire'', along with the acoustic set.\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\n===Original release===\nOn September 10, 2007, the group revealed the album's artwork.<ref name=AltPartwork>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_2673|title=Angels & Airwaves reveal album art|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|date=September 10, 2007|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> \"Everything's Magic\" was made available for streaming via the group's [[Myspace]] account on August 29, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_2587|title=Angles & Airwaves post new single|work=Alternative Press|date=August 29, 2007|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref> and was released to radio on September 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/mail/archive/eweekly/alternative/2007-9-11.html|title=AllAccess.com Alternative eWeekly|work=AllAccess|date=September 11, 2007|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> A music video was released for \"Everything's Magic\" on September 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_2750|title=Angels And Airwaves post \"Everything\u2019s Magic\" video|work=Alternative Press|date=September 20, 2007|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> The album was delayed multiple times before its official release. DeLonge originally stated that ''I-Empire'' would be released on October 16. The release date was later pushed back to October 23. The following day, ''I-Empire'' was fully leaked onto the internet, a week before its worldwide release. That same day DeLonge posted his response to the leak on the Angels & Airwaves [[MySpace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/angelsandairwaves|title=Angels and Airwaves - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> The album was eventually released on November 6 through [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] and [[Suretone Records]].<ref name=AltPartwork/> On November 16, DeLonge announced on [[Modlife]] that the band were making a short film for the song \"Breathe\". The short film for the song was made shortly after, and was later released exclusively to premium Modlife members.\n\nFrom late January to mid-March 2008, the band embarked on their headlining North American tour, playing sold-out theaters with [[Meg and Dia]], [[Ace Enders]] and [[The Color Fred]]. \"Secret Crowds\" was chosen as the second single from ''I-Empire'', although \"Call to Arms\" was also considered, after receiving lots of positive feedback and decent digital sales. The song impacted radio on February 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/mail/archive/eweekly/alternative/2008-1-29.html|title=AllAccess.com Alternative eWeekly|work=AllAccess|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}</ref> On February 25, \"Secret Crowds\" aired on MTV2, being the band's second single from the album to hit commercial heights with a music video. It has since gone onto [[Kerrang! (TV channel)|Kerrang! TV]] and Scuzz in the UK. \"Breathe\" is the third single taken from the album, and the video was released on June 20, 2008.\n\n===Vinyl release===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nIn January 2016, DeLonge's media company, To the Stars, announced the release of a 180 gram clear first pressing of ''I-Empire'', available only to paid members of the company's website. The vinyl edition features bonus acoustic tracks, \"The Adventure\" and \"Good Day\". The record was produced on vinyl by SRC Vinyl and Stan Ricker Mastering. In early February 2016, SRC Vinyl announced a 180 gram gold-colored second pressing of the record, available exclusively on the SRC Vinyl website to the public.\n\nOn January 11, 2017, DeLonge and To the Stars announced via social media and the To the Stars official website that the entire Angels & Airwaves discography, including a re-pressing of ''I-Empire'', would be released in a new vinyl collection collectively called Angels & Airwaves 2017 Hope vinyl collection.<ref name=\"tothestars.media\">{{Cite web |url=https://tothestars.media/collections/angels-and-airwaves/products/angels-and-airwaves-2017-hope-vinyl-collection?variant=36373520839 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-01-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118140844/https://tothestars.media/collections/angels-and-airwaves/products/angels-and-airwaves-2017-hope-vinyl-collection?variant=36373520839 |archive-date=2017-01-18 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The website also made all of the band's albums and EPs available individually.

It was officially released worldwide on November 1, 2007 from the Angels & Airwaves website, where it was available for download. It was then released on CD on November 5 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and on November 6 in the United States and Canada. It is their first album to feature [[Matt Wachter]] on bass.\n\n==Production==\nAngels & Airwaves started work on ''I-Empire'' in the beginning of 2007. It was the first album ever recorded at Jupiter Sound (Macbeth's studio).\n\nOn May 20, 2007, in an interview with Alternative Radio, the band said that the album was 60-70% complete and that the record would be out in October or November 2007. DeLonge also stated that the album would continue the element of the first album, but \"times ten\" and that in a story, ''I-Empire'' would follow ''We Don't Need to Whisper''; ''We Don't Need to Whisper'' being a \"re-birth\" of life, and ''I-Empire'' being an album about what you do after the rebirth. It has a slightly more mellow, ambient tone with lyrics focusing more on relationships and less about war and conflict.\n\nOn May 30, 2007, DeLonge stated in an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' that the new album would be named ''I-Empire'' and \"this is as exciting as rock 'n' roll gets!\"\n\nOn July 29, 2007, as a part of the 'Everybody Hurts' tour, Angels & Airwaves played the studio versions of four new songs from ''I-Empire'' to their fans. The songs played were \"Secret Crowds\", \"Sirens\", \"Lifeline\", and \"[[Everything's Magic]]\", along with live acoustic performances of \"Everything's Magic\", \"The Gift\", \"Good Day\", \"Do It for Me Now\", and \"The Adventure\". These songs were all recorded and leaked onto the internet, giving fans their first glimpse of ''I-Empire'', along with the acoustic set.\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\n===Original release===\nOn September 10, 2007, the group revealed the album's artwork.<ref name=AltPartwork>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_2673|title=Angels & Airwaves reveal album art|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|date=September 10, 2007|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> \"Everything's Magic\" was made available for streaming via the group's [[Myspace]] account on August 29, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_2587|title=Angles & Airwaves post new single|work=Alternative Press|date=August 29, 2007|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref> and was released to radio on September 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/mail/archive/eweekly/alternative/2007-9-11.html|title=AllAccess.com Alternative eWeekly|work=AllAccess|date=September 11, 2007|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> A music video was released for \"Everything's Magic\" on September 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/index.php/news/entry/archive_2750|title=Angels And Airwaves post \"Everything\u2019s Magic\" video|work=Alternative Press|date=September 20, 2007|accessdate=March 19, 2017}}</ref> The album was delayed multiple times before its official release. DeLonge originally stated that ''I-Empire'' would be released on October 16. The release date was later pushed back to October 23. The following day, ''I-Empire'' was fully leaked onto the internet, a week before its worldwide release. That same day DeLonge posted his response to the leak on the Angels & Airwaves [[MySpace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/angelsandairwaves|title=Angels and Airwaves - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace|accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref> The album was eventually released on November 6 through [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] and [[Suretone Records]].<ref name=AltPartwork/> On November 16, DeLonge announced on [[Modlife]] that the band were making a short film for the song \"Breathe\". The short film for the song was made shortly after, and was later released exclusively to premium Modlife members.\n\nFrom late January to mid-March 2008, the band embarked on their headlining North American tour, playing sold-out theaters with [[Meg and Dia]], [[Ace Enders]] and [[The Color Fred]]. \"Secret Crowds\" was chosen as the second single from ''I-Empire'', although \"Call to Arms\" was also considered, after receiving lots of positive feedback and decent digital sales. The song impacted radio on February 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/mail/archive/eweekly/alternative/2008-1-29.html|title=AllAccess.com Alternative eWeekly|work=AllAccess|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}</ref> On February 25, \"Secret Crowds\" aired on MTV2, being the band's second single from the album to hit commercial heights with a music video. It has since gone onto [[Kerrang! (TV channel)|Kerrang!

The song was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. It is built around a piano [[ballad]], with lyrics telling the story about a man's desire to love and an apology. The song was released in the United Kingdom as the second single from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' and reached number 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]]. It was released in the United States as the third single and reached number 18 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and number 34 on the [[Adult Top 40]] chart.\n\nCritics were highly positive towards \"The Scientist\" and praised the song's [[piano ballad]] and [[falsetto]]. Several remixes of the track exist, and its riff has been widely [[sampling (music)|sampled]]. The single's music video won three [[MTV Music Video Awards]], for the video's use of [[Reverse chronology|reverse narrative]]. The song was also featured on the band's 2003 live album ''[[Coldplay Live 2003|Live 2003]]'' and has been a permanent fixture in the band's live set lists since 2002.\n\n==Background==\nLead singer [[Chris Martin]] wrote \"The Scientist\" after listening to [[George Harrison]]'s ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456997/08132002/coldplay.jhtml |title=Coldplay&nbsp;\u2014 Going Out of My Head |accessdate=30 August 2008 |date=13 August 2002 |publisher=[[VH1]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020112623/http://www.vh1.com/artists/interview/1456997/08132002/coldplay.jhtml |archivedate=20 October 2012 }}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'', he knew that the album was missing something.<ref name=\"the scientist\">{{cite web|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/coldplay/articles/story/7381688/qa_chris_martin|title=Q&A: Chris Martin|accessdate=30 August 2008|date=16 June 2005|work=Rolling Stone|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901065807/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/coldplay/articles/story/7381688/qa_chris_martin|archivedate=1 September 2009}}</ref> One night, during a stay in [[Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Oldham|title=Coldplay Yellow Fever|date=July 2002|work=Auckland, New Zealand Newspaper}}</ref> Martin found an old piano that was out of tune.

The song was written collaboratively by all the band members for their second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. It is built around a piano [[ballad]], with lyrics telling the story about a man's desire to love and an apology. The song was released in the United Kingdom as the second single from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'' and reached number 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]]. It was released in the United States as the third single and reached number 18 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and number 34 on the [[Adult Top 40]] chart.\n\nCritics were highly positive towards \"The Scientist\" and praised the song's [[piano ballad]] and [[falsetto]]. Several remixes of the track exist, and its riff has been widely [[sampling (music)|sampled]].

Respectively, both are the fourth and fifth episode of their season, and they premiered in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on November 4 and 11,&nbsp;2007. In the former, housewife [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] receives cruise tickets from [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], and invites her husband, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], on the cruise with her. This upsets [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], and he ultimately appears to [[matricide|murder Lois]] while she is on the cruise, only to find out that she had survived the attack as the year passes. In the latter, Lois is able to expose Stewie as the villain that he is, but he soon accomplishes his dream of world domination.\n\n\"Stewie Kills Lois\" was written by [[David A. Goodman]] and directed by [[John Holmquist]], while \"Lois Kills Stewie\" was written by [[Steve Callaghan]] and directed by Greg Colton. Both episodes received relatively positive reviews for their combined [[story arc]] and cultural references. \"Lois Kills Stewie\" featured appearances by [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Randy Jackson]], [[Simon Cowell]] and [[Willem Dafoe]] (although Dafoe did not provide his voice),<ref name=DafoeInterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a391859/willem-dafoe-reacts-to-family-guy-cameo-it-was-pretty-cool.html|title=Exclusive: Willem Dafoe reacts to 'Family Guy' cameo: 'It was pretty cool'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2015-06-13|date=2012-07-06}}</ref> and both episodes featured cameos by various recurring voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot==\n===\"Stewie Kills Lois\"===\nOn [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]' birthday, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] gives her a pair of cruise tickets with the intention of going with her. She invites [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] instead, disappointing Brian. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] is also upset at not being invited on the cruise, and he concocts a plan to embarrass Lois upon her return. Brian points out that Stewie has never followed through with any of his plans to hurt Lois. Stewie, disappointed in himself for being 'all talk', resolves to prove Brian wrong. Meanwhile, on the cruise, Peter proves to be a frequent source of humiliation for Lois, [[defecation|defecating]] on the [[poop deck]] and telling the story of how he and Lois almost aborted Meg to the ship's captain at dinner. Furious at Peter, Lois walks onto the deck to get away from him, but is confronted by Stewie, who has traveled to the ship via [[speedboat]]. He shoots her repeatedly with a [[submachine gun]], sending her overboard. Six days later, [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] informs Peter that he has called off the search for Lois since he and his [[police officer|police squad]] are unable to find her.\n\nA year passes. Peter has begun dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois from time to time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie indirectly reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and enraged, Brian vows to avenge Lois\u2019 death. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]], and [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' garbage and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.\n\nPeter goes on trial for Lois' murder. [[List of Family Guy characters#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] commits [[perjury]] under the authorities noses by falsely testifying against Peter, and Peter is close to receiving life in prison. However, Lois suddenly appears in the courtroom and reveals that Stewie, not Peter, tried to kill her.\n\n===\"Lois Kills Stewie\"===\nFollowing a brief recap by the [[List of Family Guy characters#Quahog Channel 5 News|Channel 5 News team]], the episode picks up where \"Stewie Kills Lois\" ended.\n\nEveryone is in disbelief that Stewie would try to murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and explains what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a reverse [[merman]]. Having developed [[retrograde amnesia]], she started working at a [[fat camp]] in [[North Carolina]]. While at a diner, she met a new boyfriend, who turns out to be a [[white supremacist]]. While at a rally, she spoke out against them and took a blow to the head, regaining her memory, at which point she returned to [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]].\n\nAs Lois explains her miraculous return, Stewie escapes. He ties up his family when they return home, and he kills Cleveland when he drops by (Cleveland later arrives in Heaven only to find out about their prejudiced policy on credit card imprints). He kidnaps Brian and forces him to drive him to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], where he gains access to a [[supercomputer]] and takes control of the global power grid. The CIA submits to his demands, and Stewie becomes \"President of the World\".\n\nUpon his rise to power, Stewie implements harsh, cruel and unusual laws and policies, creating [[Internment|concentration camps]] housing prisoners for unfair crimes. Lois, unable to stand idly by as her son terrorizes the world, decides to assassinate him. After taking weapons from Stewie's own weapons vault, she engages him in a destructive battle in the [[Oval Office]]. Lois eventually gains the upper hand and prepares to kill Stewie, but cannot bring herself to murder her own child. Stewie takes the opportunity to disarm her, but, before he can kill Lois, he is shot and killed by Peter, who uses a one-liner from ''[[Lethal Weapon II]]'' only for Brian to comment that it didn\u2019t fit the context of the situation. Peter and Lois mourn over Stewie's [[corpse]].\n\nIt is then revealed that what has happened was actually a [[computer simulation]] that Stewie created to see what would happen if he killed Lois. Brian comes into the room with postcards from Peter and Lois on the cruise, which is going well for them and finds Stewie coming out of the device. Stewie explains what he was doing, causing Brian to wonder if a hypothetical external viewer of the simulation would feel cheated by what was ultimately a \"[[dream sequence]]\", but Stewie argues that a computer simulation is totally different. Stewie then claims that he is not yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation, while Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like ''[[The Sopranos]]'', where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|the scene cuts to black mid-sentence]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Patrick Stewart Photo Call Logan Berlinale 2017 (cropped).jpg|180px|thumb|right|Actor [[Patrick Stewart]] guest starred in \"Lois Kills Stewie\".]]\n\n\"Stewie Kills Lois\" and \"Lois Kills Stewie\" are the 102nd and 103rd episodes of ''Family Guy'' respectively.

Respectively, both are the fourth and fifth episode of their season, and they premiered in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on November 4 and 11,&nbsp;2007. In the former, housewife [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] receives cruise tickets from [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], and invites her husband, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], on the cruise with her. This upsets [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], and he ultimately appears to [[matricide|murder Lois]] while she is on the cruise, only to find out that she had survived the attack as the year passes.

She invites [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] instead, disappointing Brian. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] is also upset at not being invited on the cruise, and he concocts a plan to embarrass Lois upon her return. Brian points out that Stewie has never followed through with any of his plans to hurt Lois. Stewie, disappointed in himself for being 'all talk', resolves to prove Brian wrong. Meanwhile, on the cruise, Peter proves to be a frequent source of humiliation for Lois, [[defecation|defecating]] on the [[poop deck]] and telling the story of how he and Lois almost aborted Meg to the ship's captain at dinner. Furious at Peter, Lois walks onto the deck to get away from him, but is confronted by Stewie, who has traveled to the ship via [[speedboat]]. He shoots her repeatedly with a [[submachine gun]], sending her overboard. Six days later, [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] informs Peter that he has called off the search for Lois since he and his [[police officer|police squad]] are unable to find her.\n\nA year passes. Peter has begun dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois from time to time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie indirectly reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and enraged, Brian vows to avenge Lois\u2019 death. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]], and [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' garbage and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting.\n\nPeter goes on trial for Lois' murder. [[List of Family Guy characters#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] commits [[perjury]] under the authorities noses by falsely testifying against Peter, and Peter is close to receiving life in prison. However, Lois suddenly appears in the courtroom and reveals that Stewie, not Peter, tried to kill her.\n\n===\"Lois Kills Stewie\"===\nFollowing a brief recap by the [[List of Family Guy characters#Quahog Channel 5 News|Channel 5 News team]], the episode picks up where \"Stewie Kills Lois\" ended.\n\nEveryone is in disbelief that Stewie would try to murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and explains what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a reverse [[merman]]. Having developed [[retrograde amnesia]], she started working at a [[fat camp]] in [[North Carolina]]. While at a diner, she met a new boyfriend, who turns out to be a [[white supremacist]]. While at a rally, she spoke out against them and took a blow to the head, regaining her memory, at which point she returned to [[Quahog, Rhode Island|Quahog]].\n\nAs Lois explains her miraculous return, Stewie escapes. He ties up his family when they return home, and he kills Cleveland when he drops by (Cleveland later arrives in Heaven only to find out about their prejudiced policy on credit card imprints). He kidnaps Brian and forces him to drive him to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], where he gains access to a [[supercomputer]] and takes control of the global power grid. The CIA submits to his demands, and Stewie becomes \"President of the World\".\n\nUpon his rise to power, Stewie implements harsh, cruel and unusual laws and policies, creating [[Internment|concentration camps]] housing prisoners for unfair crimes. Lois, unable to stand idly by as her son terrorizes the world, decides to assassinate him. After taking weapons from Stewie's own weapons vault, she engages him in a destructive battle in the [[Oval Office]]. Lois eventually gains the upper hand and prepares to kill Stewie, but cannot bring herself to murder her own child. Stewie takes the opportunity to disarm her, but, before he can kill Lois, he is shot and killed by Peter, who uses a one-liner from ''[[Lethal Weapon II]]'' only for Brian to comment that it didn\u2019t fit the context of the situation. Peter and Lois mourn over Stewie's [[corpse]].\n\nIt is then revealed that what has happened was actually a [[computer simulation]] that Stewie created to see what would happen if he killed Lois. Brian comes into the room with postcards from Peter and Lois on the cruise, which is going well for them and finds Stewie coming out of the device. Stewie explains what he was doing, causing Brian to wonder if a hypothetical external viewer of the simulation would feel cheated by what was ultimately a \"[[dream sequence]]\", but Stewie argues that a computer simulation is totally different. Stewie then claims that he is not yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation, while Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like ''[[The Sopranos]]'', where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|the scene cuts to black mid-sentence]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Patrick Stewart Photo Call Logan Berlinale 2017 (cropped).jpg|180px|thumb|right|Actor [[Patrick Stewart]] guest starred in \"Lois Kills Stewie\".]]\n\n\"Stewie Kills Lois\" and \"Lois Kills Stewie\" are the 102nd and 103rd episodes of ''Family Guy'' respectively.

L. Mero's ''Mineral Resources of the Sea''.<ref name=Glasby/> The book claimed that nearly limitless supplies of cobalt, [[nickel]] and other \nmetals could be found throughout the planet's oceans. Mero stated that these metals occurred in deposits of [[manganese nodules]], which appear as lumps of compressed flowers on the seafloor at \ndepths of about 5,000 m. Some nations including [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] sent out research vessels in search of nodule deposits. Initial estimates of deep sea mining viability turned out to be much exaggerated. This overestimate, coupled with depressed metal prices, led to the near abandonment of nodule mining by 1982. From the 1960s to 1984 an estimated US $650 million had \nbeen spent on the venture, with little to no return.<ref name=Glasby/>\n\nOver the past decade a new phase of deep-sea mining has begun. Rising demand for precious metals in [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[India]] has pushed these countries in search of new sources. Interest has recently shifted toward hydrothermal vents as the source of metals instead of scattered nodules. The trend of transition towards an electricity-based information and transportation infrastructure currently seen in western societies further pushes demands for precious metals. The current revived interest in phosphorus nodule mining at the seafloor stems from phosphor-based artificial fertilizers being of significant importance for world food production. Growing world population pushes the need for artificial fertilizers or greater incorporation of organic systems within agricultural infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, the best potential deep sea site, the Solwara 1 Project, has been found in the waters off [[Papua New Guinea]], a high grade copper-gold resource and the world's first Seafloor Massive Sulphide (SMS) resource.<ref name=\"naut\"/> The Solwara 1 Project is located at 1600 metres water depth in the [[Bismarck Sea]], [[New Ireland Province]].<ref name=\"naut\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Projects-Solwara.asp|title=Solwara 1 Project \u2013 High Grade Copper and Gold|year=2010|publisher=Nautilus Minerals Inc|accessdate=14 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812102807/http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Projects-Solwara.asp|archivedate=12 August 2010}}</ref> Using ROV ([[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s) technology developed by UK-based Soil Machine Dynamics, Nautilus Minerals Inc. is first company of its kind to announce plans to begin full-scale undersea excavation of mineral deposits.<ref name=treasure>[http://www.economist.com/node/8312172 \"Treasure on the ocean floor\"].

Despite extensive exploration both within and outside of EEZs, only a few countries, notably New Zealand, have established legal and institutional frameworks for the future development of deep seabed mining.\n\nPapua New Guinea was the first country to approve a permit for the exploration of minerals in the deep seabed. Solwara 1 was awarded its licence and environmental permits despite three independent reviews of the environmental impact statement mine finding significant gaps and flaws in the underlying science ( see http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/report/).\n\nThe ISA has recently arranged a workshop in Australia where scientific experts, industry representatives, legal specialists and academics worked towards improving existing regulations and ensuring that development of seabed minerals does not cause serious and permanent damage to the marine environment.\n\n==Resources mined==\n\nThe deep sea contains many different resources available for extraction, including silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and zinc.

Using drills and other cutting tools, the ROVs obtain samples to be analyzed for precious materials. Once a site has been located, a mining ship or station is set up to mine the area.<ref name=treasure/>\n\nThere are two predominant forms of mineral extraction being considered for full-scale operations: continuous-line bucket system (CLB) and the hydraulic suction system. The CLB system is the preferred method of nodule collection. It operates much like a conveyor-belt, running from the sea floor to the surface of the ocean where a ship or mining platform extracts the desired minerals, and returns the [[tailings]] to the ocean.<ref name=\"Nath, B. 2000\"/> Hydraulic suction mining lowers a pipe to the seafloor which transfers nodules up to the mining ship. Another pipe from the ship to the seafloor returns the tailings to the area of the mining site.<ref name=\"Nath, B. 2000\"/>\n\nIn recent years, the most promising mining areas have been the Central and Eastern Manus Basin around Papua New Guinea and the crater of Conical Seamount to the east. These locations have shown promising amounts of gold in the area's sulfide deposits (an average of 26 [[parts per million]]). The relatively shallow water depth of 1050 m, along with the close proximity of a gold processing plant makes for an excellent mining site.<ref name=Glasby/>\n\nDeep sea mining project value chain can be differentiated using the criteria of the type of activities where the value is actually added. During prospecting, exploration and resource assessment phases the value is added to intangible assets, for the extraction, processing and distribution phases the value increases with relation to product processing. There is an intermediate phase \u2013 the pilot mining test which could be considered to be an inevitable step in the shift from \u201cresources\u201d to \u201creserves\u201d classification, where the actual value starts.<ref name=\":0\">Abramowski, T.

The resource valuation incorporates the examination of data in the context of potential mining feasibility.\n\nValue chain based on product processing involves such operations as actual mining (or extraction), vertical transport, storing, offloading, transport, metallurgical processing for final products. Unlike the exploration phase, the value increases after each operation on processed material eventually delivered to the metal market. Logistics involves technologies analogous to those applied in land mines. This is also the case for the metallurgical processing, although rich and polymetallic mineral composition which distinguishes marine minerals from its land analogs requires special treatment of the deposit.

L. Mero's ''Mineral Resources of the Sea''.<ref name=Glasby/> The book claimed that nearly limitless supplies of cobalt, [[nickel]] and other \nmetals could be found throughout the planet's oceans. Mero stated that these metals occurred in deposits of [[manganese nodules]], which appear as lumps of compressed flowers on the seafloor at \ndepths of about 5,000 m. Some nations including [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] sent out research vessels in search of nodule deposits. Initial estimates of deep sea mining viability turned out to be much exaggerated. This overestimate, coupled with depressed metal prices, led to the near abandonment of nodule mining by 1982. From the 1960s to 1984 an estimated US $650 million had \nbeen spent on the venture, with little to no return.<ref name=Glasby/>\n\nOver the past decade a new phase of deep-sea mining has begun. Rising demand for precious metals in [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[India]] has pushed these countries in search of new sources. Interest has recently shifted toward hydrothermal vents as the source of metals instead of scattered nodules. The trend of transition towards an electricity-based information and transportation infrastructure currently seen in western societies further pushes demands for precious metals. The current revived interest in phosphorus nodule mining at the seafloor stems from phosphor-based artificial fertilizers being of significant importance for world food production. Growing world population pushes the need for artificial fertilizers or greater incorporation of organic systems within agricultural infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, the best potential deep sea site, the Solwara 1 Project, has been found in the waters off [[Papua New Guinea]], a high grade copper-gold resource and the world's first Seafloor Massive Sulphide (SMS) resource.<ref name=\"naut\"/> The Solwara 1 Project is located at 1600 metres water depth in the [[Bismarck Sea]], [[New Ireland Province]].<ref name=\"naut\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Projects-Solwara.asp|title=Solwara 1 Project \u2013 High Grade Copper and Gold|year=2010|publisher=Nautilus Minerals Inc|accessdate=14 September 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812102807/http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Projects-Solwara.asp|archivedate=12 August 2010}}</ref> Using ROV ([[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s) technology developed by UK-based Soil Machine Dynamics, Nautilus Minerals Inc. is first company of its kind to announce plans to begin full-scale undersea excavation of mineral deposits.<ref name=treasure>[http://www.economist.com/node/8312172 \"Treasure on the ocean floor\"].

Using drills and other cutting tools, the ROVs obtain samples to be analyzed for precious materials. Once a site has been located, a mining ship or station is set up to mine the area.<ref name=treasure/>\n\nThere are two predominant forms of mineral extraction being considered for full-scale operations: continuous-line bucket system (CLB) and the hydraulic suction system. The CLB system is the preferred method of nodule collection. It operates much like a conveyor-belt, running from the sea floor to the surface of the ocean where a ship or mining platform extracts the desired minerals, and returns the [[tailings]] to the ocean.<ref name=\"Nath, B. 2000\"/> Hydraulic suction mining lowers a pipe to the seafloor which transfers nodules up to the mining ship. Another pipe from the ship to the seafloor returns the tailings to the area of the mining site.<ref name=\"Nath, B. 2000\"/>\n\nIn recent years, the most promising mining areas have been the Central and Eastern Manus Basin around Papua New Guinea and the crater of Conical Seamount to the east. These locations have shown promising amounts of gold in the area's sulfide deposits (an average of 26 [[parts per million]]). The relatively shallow water depth of 1050 m, along with the close proximity of a gold processing plant makes for an excellent mining site.<ref name=Glasby/>\n\nDeep sea mining project value chain can be differentiated using the criteria of the type of activities where the value is actually added. During prospecting, exploration and resource assessment phases the value is added to intangible assets, for the extraction, processing and distribution phases the value increases with relation to product processing. There is an intermediate phase \u2013 the pilot mining test which could be considered to be an inevitable step in the shift from \u201cresources\u201d to \u201creserves\u201d classification, where the actual value starts.<ref name=\":0\">Abramowski, T.

The resource valuation incorporates the examination of data in the context of potential mining feasibility.\n\nValue chain based on product processing involves such operations as actual mining (or extraction), vertical transport, storing, offloading, transport, metallurgical processing for final products. Unlike the exploration phase, the value increases after each operation on processed material eventually delivered to the metal market. Logistics involves technologies analogous to those applied in land mines. This is also the case for the metallurgical processing, although rich and polymetallic mineral composition which distinguishes marine minerals from its land analogs requires special treatment of the deposit.
