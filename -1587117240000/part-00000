{"title_page": "List of newspapers in Bangladesh", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Contains Bengali text}}\nThis '''list of newspapers in Bangladesh''' is a list of [[newspaper]]s printed and distributed in [[Bangladesh]]. Newspapers published in Bangladesh are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] or [[English language|English]] versions. Most Bangladeshi daily newspapers are usually printed in broadsheets; few daily tabloids exist. Daily newspapers in Bangladesh are published in the capital, [[Dhaka]], as well as in major regional cities such as [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Barisal]]. All daily newspapers are morning editions; there are no evening editions in Bangladesh. Some newspapers offer online versions.\n\n==Notable daily newspapers==\n\n===Bengali-language newspapers===\n{{Expand list|date=April 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=2 | Newspaper name\n! rowspan=2 | Founded\n! rowspan=2 | Owner/Publisher\n! rowspan=2 | Editor\n! rowspan=2 | Region\n! rowspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Circulation <br/> <small>(June, 2018)</small>    \n|-\n!

The region of North Karnataka was more under so-called Elephant, Lion, Horse and Bull Maharatis.  Again, later Shatavahana branch and Later Kuras moved southward to establish only in Banavasi. The region of Dakshina Kannada (modern Udupi and Mangalore district) was free from any such an external influence and appears to have been under the strict control of Alupa kings in the ancient times.\n\nThe rule over Uttara Kannada region, with Banavasi as its capital was by [[Chutu]] clan followed by the [[Shatavahana]] branch which governed for Siri, Siva, Pulumavi and Yajna Satakarnis, prior to the Kadambas. With the Kadambas rule from Banavasi, Karnataka saw developments in the field of art and culture. Land of Karnataka saw more and more epigraphs that recorded the activities of the past, mostly erected in the temple premises. The first clear mention of Alupas comes from the [[Halmidi]] inscription of 450 CE where their possible early ruler Pashupathi of Alapa (Alupa) gana is mentioned. Pashupathi was the contemporary of the Kadambas. Hence for historical record, we can safely assume that the dynastic formation of Alupas took place around 5th century CE. Their royal emblem was the double fish and they claimed to belong to the ''Pandyavamsha'' and ''Soma Kula'' (lunar).<ref name=\"kula\">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Their coins carried the dynastic title \"Sri Pandya Dhananjaya\" which means \"Arjuna among the Pandyas\".\n\n==Land==\n[[File:Tulunadu.png|thumb| A Regional Map of Tulunadu in [[Karnataka]].Tulunadu also Includes [[Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]] state.|left]]\nAlthough Alupas controlled part of Uttara Kannada and Shimoga of Karnataka and northern part of Kerala during the zenith, the core region consisted of the modern Tulunadu which comprises Mangalore and Udupi district (earlier it used to be a single district ''Dakshina Kannada'', also known as South Canara.  In the ancient times, the region was referred as ''Alvakheda'' and during the later part of the reign, the region was referred as ''Tulunadu''. The term Tulunadu is still practised today while referring to the region.\n\n'''1. Alvakheda'''<br />\nThe term Alvakheda could be seen in several of ancient inscriptions of the Alupas. The region of Alvakheda encompassed the modern Tulunadu and part of Uttara Kannada up to Ankola on the coastal north and Banavasi on the interior west of Uttara Kannada District. Also, the region of Humcha in the Shimoga district, and the land of Kasaragod in Kerala up to the Payasvini river was the boundary in the south. The term Alvakheda is not seen in the inscriptions during the Vijayanagara period, when the region of Barakuru and Mangalore were two separate provinces under the administration of Governors who started controlling the territory without interfering in the autonomy of the Alupas.\n\n'''2. Tulunadu'''<br />\nThe region stretches from Mangalore in the south all the way to Baindoor in the north. On the west is the Arabian sea and on the east is the Western Ghat that fences the land like a fort that formed a heaven for the ruler. More than it, number of rivers that crisscrossed near Mangalore, Udyavara and Barkur made this land fertile. The western ghats, the thick forests and the towns along the shoreline of Arabian sea established several sea ports for trade with the Romans and Arabs.  Trade routes from with the Romans were well established as early as the 2nd century CE and with the Arabs around 7th century CE. The Netravati in Mangalore and Seethanadi in Barakur are the main rivers that run in the capital cities of Alupas.  Other rivers such as Suvarnanadi, Shambhavi in Karkala and Mulki, Gurupura river, Pavanje, Nandini and numerous streams all running from east to west.  The region of Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur, Karkala are the Malnad region and supported as an agricultural backbone of the kingdom and the region of Mangalore, Udupi and Kundapur are the coastal regions that supported more of marine activities though agriculture is the other occupation.\n\nAn old Malayalam inscription ([[Ramanthali inscriptions]]), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, can be found at Ramanthali near [[Kannur|Cannanore]], Kerala. <ref>Narayanan, M. G. S. ''Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.'' Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 483.</ref>\n\n==Political history==\nThe history of clan emerges from obscurity during the rise of [[Badami]] [[Chalukya]] in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions which claims the Alupas had accepted Chalukya overlordship and become their feudatory.<ref name=\"kula\"/> They ruled initially from [[Mangalore]] and other times from Udyavara in [[Udupi]] and later [[Barkur]]. Their first regular full-length inscription is the ''Vaddarase'' inscription in Kannada is dated to early 7th century. They maintained marital relations with their overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\">Kamath (2001), p97</ref>\n\nAlupas rule confined to the modern districts of Udupi, Mangalore and parts of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts in the state of Karanataka and part of northern Kerala (Kasaragod district) up to Payashvini river. In the history of India, no other single dynasty has ever ruled for over thousands years. The record that breaks this exception goes to the Alupas who ruled their territory for nearly thousand years.  Alupas though originated as a ruler to the coastal region of Karnataka around the beginning of the Christian era, it is only around the 5th century they made their debut as a dynasty as witnessed in the epigraph of Halmidi. The last ruler's name that we see in the epigraph of Venupura (Moodubidre), belong to the 14th century CE. There are over two hundred stone epigraphs left behind this dynasty and only about one hundred and twenty epigraphs have been read and deciphered so far. The finest record of the early Kannada script is seen in the 7th-century CE copper plate of Belmannu.  There is yet another set of five copper plates that surfaced in the beginning of 2007, but no information is known about the ruler, provenance within the district of Udupi or its content.\n\nAlupas put coins into circulation in 8th century CE and continued the tradition till 14th century CE. Their coins carried the dynastic emblem of \"Two fishes over a spread Lotus flower, below a royal umbrella\". Nearly 180 unique coins have been known so far, of which around 175 coins are published in the book written by Prabhu and Pai. The detailed history, with proper reference pointers is also seen in the same book.\n\n==Epigraphs==\n[[File:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|The Vaddarse Old Kannada inscription (650 AD) of King Aluvarasa I]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] in Kannada language is attributed to Aluvarasa II, called the Belamannu plates and is dated the early 8th century, according to Dr. Gururaj Bhat.<ref name=\"oldest\"/> This full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century CE) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District, and displays the double crested fish, the royal emblem of Alupa kings. The records also refers to the king with the title Alupendra.\n\nThe first known epigraph that talks about the possession of Banavasi Mandala (Banavasi kingdom of Uttara Kannada District) by the Alupas, belongs to the reign of Western Chalukya king Vinayaditya.<ref name=\"Ist Stone Epigraph\">Journal of the Institute of Indian Studies, 1978 May Vol#1</ref> Te epigraph comes from Jambani of Sagar Taluk, discovered by Dr Gururaj Bhat, mentions about Chitravahana Alupendra in possession of Kadamba mandala.

The Panchalingeshwara temple at Barkur, Brahmalingeshwara temple at Brahamavar, Koteshwara temple at Kotinatha and the Sadashiva temple at Suratkal are attributed to them. They used sculptural styles from their various overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\n1. '''Sri Rajarajeshwari Temple, Polali'''\n[[File:Polali Shri Rajarajeshwari.jpg|thumb| Clay [[Murti]] of the Goddess Rajarajeshwari at the temple patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore District, [[Polali Rajarajeshwari Temple]] is one of the oldest temple that has the earliest inscription of the Alupa dynasty, written in 8th-century Kannada. The temple is dedicated to Sri Rajarashewari, and Alupa kings enriched this temple during throughout their rule.\n\n2. '''Sri Manjunatheshwara Temple, Kadri'''\n[[File:Kadri temple.JPG|thumb|The Kadri Manjunath temple was built and patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore district, Kadri has the other important and old temple that belonged to the era of Alupas. The temple has several finest bronze statues installed by the King Kundavarma, which bears inscriptions of him dated 968 CE. In the inscription of Lokeshwara statue, king Kundavarma is compared to Arjuna in bravery.\n\n3. '''Sri Mahishamardini Temple, Neelavara'''<br />\nIn times, Alupas changed their capital from Mangalore to Udyavara, Udyavara to Mangalore and then again to Barkur depending on the political situation and demand. To be in centre to their ruling place, they even shifted their capital to Barakur from where they could look after the vast territory which spread up to Ankola in the North Kanara (Uttara Kannada District).  During this period, they patronised several temples in the surrounding areas of Barakuru (which was their captiral). Neelavara Kshetra is one such a holy place where Mahishasuramardini temple has several Alupa inscriptions of later period.\n\n4. '''Sri Panchalingeshwara Temple, Vittla'''<br />\nThis temple is one of the oldest temple of Alupa territory, built during 7th century CE. The architecture of the temple is in line with that of Sri Ananteshwara temple which is the oldest temple built by the Alupas. The architecture is unique and is an innovation of 7th century. The Havyakha Brahmins of Uttara Kannada were attracted during 7th century CE by the Alupas and were given Agraharas for imparting Vedic knowledge to the people of Alvakheda.  The Alupas built many temples and allowed these Brahmins to take care of it. The legend says that there were hundreds of temples that every day there is a festival in one or other temple of the region.  The temple of Vittla Panchalingeshwara is one of the oldest structure which was renovated by the later local dynasties such as Heggades.\n\n5. '''Sri Anantheshwara Temple, Udupi'''<br />\nDiagonally opposite to the main entrance of the Sri Krishna Mutt, and adjacent to the Chandramouleeshwara Temple, stands one of the oldest Alupa temple namely '''''[[Udupi Anantheshwara Temple|Sri Anantheswara Temple]]'''''.  An old belief is that lighting a lamp at the ancient Anantheshwara Temple takes away evil and sins. It is one of the biggest temple in Udupi. The main idol is Linga, whose adornment makes it to look like a Face of Lord Siva. From a small window on the left, the site where Madhvacharya disappeared is seen.\n\nBoth Sri Vittla Panchalingeshwara and Sri Udupi Anantheshwara Temple have Elephant-back type curvilinear structure. Another temple of similar architecture is also seen in Aihole Durga temple, appears to be a structure of 7th century CE. So, tagging it to any architectural style is ruled out unless more detailed study or research is done on this topic. The unique noteworthy feature of the architecture of South Canara temples is their roof.  Being in a landscape of high rainfall, the temple roofs evolved from grass, clay tiles and eventually with the copper-plates.\n\n==Coinage==\nThe Alupas as a feudatory of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in coastal Karnataka issued coins with [[Kannada]] and [[Devanagari|Nagari]] inscriptions on them. Coins with Kannada legends seem to have minted in Mangalore and those with Nagari legend at the Udupi mint. Kannada was their language of administration. The Pagodas and Fanams were the common coinage of all the Alupa kings.  The obverse of the coins carried the royal emblem \"Two Fishes\" and the reverse had the legend \"Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya\"  either in Nagari or old (Hale) Kannada.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\nThis paragraph is about the inscription found at Neelavara temple of Udupi district. This is all about the grant in \"Gadyana\" denomination. The Alupas while ruling from Barakuru showed great interest in the development of temple. This record is of the Alupa ruler Veerapandyadeva, dated 1258 CE mentions about his instruction to \"neeruvara munnuru\" i.e. Neeruvara-300, the modern Neelavara village Assembly. It states that after paying 100 gadyanas (coins) to the palace and 30 gadyanas to Adhikari, remaining 30 gadyanas, should be used by the village assembly for its expense. Yet another inscription of Veerapandyadeva's queen Ballamahadevi, the next ruler is also seen here. The record mentions that when Ballamahadevi was ruling her kingdom with the help of samastapradanas, Deshi purushas, Bahattara niyogis and Rishi Purohita, she gave a grant to Niruvara Bhagavati, out of 100 honnus that is paid to the palace. This inscription was written by Keshava Senabhova as mentioned in the epigraph.\n\nThe Alupas were one of the three dynasties that issued gold coins as early as 8th century CE. The gold that used to mint coins came from trade with the Romans, Arabs and from the adjacent kingdom of Gangas. No other ancient dynasties of the south have issued that many varieties of gold coins as Alupas and Gangas did.  The coins of both Gangas and Alupas have inscriptions that helps in dating the period of issue. Unfortunately these coins have not drawn much attention compared to that of Chalukyas or Hoysals. But for sure, they have inspired later dynasties as a prototype or basis to issue coins.

The region of North Karnataka was more under so-called Elephant, Lion, Horse and Bull Maharatis.  Again, later Shatavahana branch and Later Kuras moved southward to establish only in Banavasi. The region of Dakshina Kannada (modern Udupi and Mangalore district) was free from any such an external influence and appears to have been under the strict control of Alupa kings in the ancient times.\n\nThe rule over Uttara Kannada region, with Banavasi as its capital was by [[Chutu]] clan followed by the [[Shatavahana]] branch which governed for Siri, Siva, Pulumavi and Yajna Satakarnis, prior to the Kadambas. With the Kadambas rule from Banavasi, Karnataka saw developments in the field of art and culture. Land of Karnataka saw more and more epigraphs that recorded the activities of the past, mostly erected in the temple premises. The first clear mention of Alupas comes from the [[Halmidi]] inscription of 450 CE where their possible early ruler Pashupathi of Alapa (Alupa) gana is mentioned. Pashupathi was the contemporary of the Kadambas. Hence for historical record, we can safely assume that the dynastic formation of Alupas took place around 5th century CE. Their royal emblem was the double fish and they claimed to belong to the ''Pandyavamsha'' and ''Soma Kula'' (lunar).<ref name=\"kula\">Kamath (2001), p94</ref> Their coins carried the dynastic title \"Sri Pandya Dhananjaya\" which means \"Arjuna among the Pandyas\".\n\n==Land==\n[[File:Tulunadu.png|thumb| A Regional Map of Tulunadu in [[Karnataka]].Tulunadu also Includes [[Kasaragod district]] of [[Kerala]] state.|left]]\nAlthough Alupas controlled part of Uttara Kannada and Shimoga of Karnataka and northern part of Kerala during the zenith, the core region consisted of the modern Tulunadu which comprises Mangalore and Udupi district (earlier it used to be a single district ''Dakshina Kannada'', also known as South Canara.  In the ancient times, the region was referred as ''Alvakheda'' and during the later part of the reign, the region was referred as ''Tulunadu''. The term Tulunadu is still practised today while referring to the region.\n\n'''1. Alvakheda'''<br />\nThe term Alvakheda could be seen in several of ancient inscriptions of the Alupas. The region of Alvakheda encompassed the modern Tulunadu and part of Uttara Kannada up to Ankola on the coastal north and Banavasi on the interior west of Uttara Kannada District. Also, the region of Humcha in the Shimoga district, and the land of Kasaragod in Kerala up to the Payasvini river was the boundary in the south. The term Alvakheda is not seen in the inscriptions during the Vijayanagara period, when the region of Barakuru and Mangalore were two separate provinces under the administration of Governors who started controlling the territory without interfering in the autonomy of the Alupas.\n\n'''2. Tulunadu'''<br />\nThe region stretches from Mangalore in the south all the way to Baindoor in the north. On the west is the Arabian sea and on the east is the Western Ghat that fences the land like a fort that formed a heaven for the ruler. More than it, number of rivers that crisscrossed near Mangalore, Udyavara and Barkur made this land fertile. The western ghats, the thick forests and the towns along the shoreline of Arabian sea established several sea ports for trade with the Romans and Arabs.  Trade routes from with the Romans were well established as early as the 2nd century CE and with the Arabs around 7th century CE. The Netravati in Mangalore and Seethanadi in Barakur are the main rivers that run in the capital cities of Alupas.  Other rivers such as Suvarnanadi, Shambhavi in Karkala and Mulki, Gurupura river, Pavanje, Nandini and numerous streams all running from east to west.  The region of Puttur, Sullia, Belthangady and Puttur, Karkala are the Malnad region and supported as an agricultural backbone of the kingdom and the region of Mangalore, Udupi and Kundapur are the coastal regions that supported more of marine activities though agriculture is the other occupation.\n\nAn old Malayalam inscription ([[Ramanthali inscriptions]]), dated to 1075 CE, mentioning king Kunda Alupa, can be found at Ramanthali near [[Kannur|Cannanore]], Kerala. <ref>Narayanan, M. G. S. ''Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.'' Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 483.</ref>\n\n==Political history==\nThe history of clan emerges from obscurity during the rise of [[Badami]] [[Chalukya]] in the Aihole and Mahakuta inscriptions which claims the Alupas had accepted Chalukya overlordship and become their feudatory.<ref name=\"kula\"/> They ruled initially from [[Mangalore]] and other times from Udyavara in [[Udupi]] and later [[Barkur]]. Their first regular full-length inscription is the ''Vaddarase'' inscription in Kannada is dated to early 7th century. They maintained marital relations with their overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\">Kamath (2001), p97</ref>\n\nAlupas rule confined to the modern districts of Udupi, Mangalore and parts of Shimoga and Uttara Kannada districts in the state of Karanataka and part of northern Kerala (Kasaragod district) up to Payashvini river. In the history of India, no other single dynasty has ever ruled for over thousands years. The record that breaks this exception goes to the Alupas who ruled their territory for nearly thousand years.  Alupas though originated as a ruler to the coastal region of Karnataka around the beginning of the Christian era, it is only around the 5th century they made their debut as a dynasty as witnessed in the epigraph of Halmidi. The last ruler's name that we see in the epigraph of Venupura (Moodubidre), belong to the 14th century CE. There are over two hundred stone epigraphs left behind this dynasty and only about one hundred and twenty epigraphs have been read and deciphered so far. The finest record of the early Kannada script is seen in the 7th-century CE copper plate of Belmannu.  There is yet another set of five copper plates that surfaced in the beginning of 2007, but no information is known about the ruler, provenance within the district of Udupi or its content.\n\nAlupas put coins into circulation in 8th century CE and continued the tradition till 14th century CE. Their coins carried the dynastic emblem of \"Two fishes over a spread Lotus flower, below a royal umbrella\". Nearly 180 unique coins have been known so far, of which around 175 coins are published in the book written by Prabhu and Pai. The detailed history, with proper reference pointers is also seen in the same book.\n\n==Epigraphs==\n[[File:M Govinda Pai Regional Research Centre Udupi 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|300px|The Vaddarse Old Kannada inscription (650 AD) of King Aluvarasa I]]\n\nThe earliest known [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plate inscription]] in Kannada language is attributed to Aluvarasa II, called the Belamannu plates and is dated the early 8th century, according to Dr. Gururaj Bhat.<ref name=\"oldest\"/> This full-length Kannada copper plates in Old Kannada script (early 8th century CE) belongs to the Alupa King Aluvarasa II from Belmannu, Karkala Taluk, Udupi District, and displays the double crested fish, the royal emblem of Alupa kings. The records also refers to the king with the title Alupendra.\n\nThe first known epigraph that talks about the possession of Banavasi Mandala (Banavasi kingdom of Uttara Kannada District) by the Alupas, belongs to the reign of Western Chalukya king Vinayaditya.<ref name=\"Ist Stone Epigraph\">Journal of the Institute of Indian Studies, 1978 May Vol#1</ref> Te epigraph comes from Jambani of Sagar Taluk, discovered by Dr Gururaj Bhat, mentions about Chitravahana Alupendra in possession of Kadamba mandala.

The Panchalingeshwara temple at Barkur, Brahmalingeshwara temple at Brahamavar, Koteshwara temple at Kotinatha and the Sadashiva temple at Suratkal are attributed to them. They used sculptural styles from their various overlords over the centuries.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\n1. '''Sri Rajarajeshwari Temple, Polali'''\n[[File:Polali Shri Rajarajeshwari.jpg|thumb| Clay [[Murti]] of the Goddess Rajarajeshwari at the temple patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore District, [[Polali Rajarajeshwari Temple]] is one of the oldest temple that has the earliest inscription of the Alupa dynasty, written in 8th-century Kannada. The temple is dedicated to Sri Rajarashewari, and Alupa kings enriched this temple during throughout their rule.\n\n2. '''Sri Manjunatheshwara Temple, Kadri'''\n[[File:Kadri temple.JPG|thumb|The Kadri Manjunath temple was built and patronized by the Alupas]]\nIn modern Mangalore district, Kadri has the other important and old temple that belonged to the era of Alupas. The temple has several finest bronze statues installed by the King Kundavarma, which bears inscriptions of him dated 968 CE. In the inscription of Lokeshwara statue, king Kundavarma is compared to Arjuna in bravery.\n\n3. '''Sri Mahishamardini Temple, Neelavara'''<br />\nIn times, Alupas changed their capital from Mangalore to Udyavara, Udyavara to Mangalore and then again to Barkur depending on the political situation and demand. To be in centre to their ruling place, they even shifted their capital to Barakur from where they could look after the vast territory which spread up to Ankola in the North Kanara (Uttara Kannada District).  During this period, they patronised several temples in the surrounding areas of Barakuru (which was their captiral). Neelavara Kshetra is one such a holy place where Mahishasuramardini temple has several Alupa inscriptions of later period.\n\n4. '''Sri Panchalingeshwara Temple, Vittla'''<br />\nThis temple is one of the oldest temple of Alupa territory, built during 7th century CE. The architecture of the temple is in line with that of Sri Ananteshwara temple which is the oldest temple built by the Alupas. The architecture is unique and is an innovation of 7th century. The Havyakha Brahmins of Uttara Kannada were attracted during 7th century CE by the Alupas and were given Agraharas for imparting Vedic knowledge to the people of Alvakheda.  The Alupas built many temples and allowed these Brahmins to take care of it. The legend says that there were hundreds of temples that every day there is a festival in one or other temple of the region.  The temple of Vittla Panchalingeshwara is one of the oldest structure which was renovated by the later local dynasties such as Heggades.\n\n5. '''Sri Anantheshwara Temple, Udupi'''<br />\nDiagonally opposite to the main entrance of the Sri Krishna Mutt, and adjacent to the Chandramouleeshwara Temple, stands one of the oldest Alupa temple namely '''''[[Udupi Anantheshwara Temple|Sri Anantheswara Temple]]'''''.  An old belief is that lighting a lamp at the ancient Anantheshwara Temple takes away evil and sins. It is one of the biggest temple in Udupi. The main idol is Linga, whose adornment makes it to look like a Face of Lord Siva. From a small window on the left, the site where Madhvacharya disappeared is seen.\n\nBoth Sri Vittla Panchalingeshwara and Sri Udupi Anantheshwara Temple have Elephant-back type curvilinear structure. Another temple of similar architecture is also seen in Aihole Durga temple, appears to be a structure of 7th century CE. So, tagging it to any architectural style is ruled out unless more detailed study or research is done on this topic. The unique noteworthy feature of the architecture of South Canara temples is their roof.  Being in a landscape of high rainfall, the temple roofs evolved from grass, clay tiles and eventually with the copper-plates.\n\n==Coinage==\nThe Alupas as a feudatory of the [[Western Chalukyas]] in coastal Karnataka issued coins with [[Kannada]] and [[Devanagari|Nagari]] inscriptions on them. Coins with Kannada legends seem to have minted in Mangalore and those with Nagari legend at the Udupi mint. Kannada was their language of administration. The Pagodas and Fanams were the common coinage of all the Alupa kings.  The obverse of the coins carried the royal emblem \"Two Fishes\" and the reverse had the legend \"Sri Pandya Dhanamjaya\"  either in Nagari or old (Hale) Kannada.<ref name=\"oldest\"/>\n\nThis paragraph is about the inscription found at Neelavara temple of Udupi district. This is all about the grant in \"Gadyana\" denomination. The Alupas while ruling from Barakuru showed great interest in the development of temple. This record is of the Alupa ruler Veerapandyadeva, dated 1258 CE mentions about his instruction to \"neeruvara munnuru\" i.e. Neeruvara-300, the modern Neelavara village Assembly. It states that after paying 100 gadyanas (coins) to the palace and 30 gadyanas to Adhikari, remaining 30 gadyanas, should be used by the village assembly for its expense. Yet another inscription of Veerapandyadeva's queen Ballamahadevi, the next ruler is also seen here. The record mentions that when Ballamahadevi was ruling her kingdom with the help of samastapradanas, Deshi purushas, Bahattara niyogis and Rishi Purohita, she gave a grant to Niruvara Bhagavati, out of 100 honnus that is paid to the palace. This inscription was written by Keshava Senabhova as mentioned in the epigraph.\n\nThe Alupas were one of the three dynasties that issued gold coins as early as 8th century CE. The gold that used to mint coins came from trade with the Romans, Arabs and from the adjacent kingdom of Gangas. No other ancient dynasties of the south have issued that many varieties of gold coins as Alupas and Gangas did.  The coins of both Gangas and Alupas have inscriptions that helps in dating the period of issue. Unfortunately these coins have not drawn much attention compared to that of Chalukyas or Hoysals. But for sure, they have inspired later dynasties as a prototype or basis to issue coins.  Shown below is the hand-drawing of some of the Pandya Gadyanas (Alupa coins) obverse image.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dr. Suryanath U.

[[Major League Baseball]] partnered with NPF as its Official Development\nPartner as a continuation of MLB's efforts to connect with female athletes and women in general.\n\nAs \"Official Development Partner\" in 2003, Major League Baseball provided introductions to Major League Baseball Clubs, community partners, broadcast partners and to [http://www.mlb.com MLB.com].\n\n{{Details|2003 National Pro Fastpitch season}}\nAs part of its long-term sales, marketing and promotional campaign, NPF featured an All-Star Tour in 2003. The tour provided each of the league's expansion team owners with tools to lay the groundwork in their marketplace for the official launch of league play in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the league relaunched with six teams in six markets:  [[California Sunbirds]] in [[Stockton, California]]; [[Arizona Heat]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]]; [[Texas Thunder]] in [[Houston, Texas]]; [[Akron Racers]] in [[Akron, Ohio]] ; [[New England Riptide]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]; and [[NY/NJ Juggernaut]] in [[Montclair, New Jersey]].\n\nThe [[2004 National Pro Fastpitch season|2004 season]] was distinguished by 178 league-wide games, 96 of the best female softball players in the country, the continued support of Major League Baseball as the Official Development Partner of NPF in the category of women's fastpitch softball, NPF playoffs (both best of three series went three games) and the inaugural NPF Championship with the [[New York/New Jersey Juggernaut]] capturing the Championship Cowles Cup with a victory over the [[New England Riptide]], fourth-place finisher in the regular season.\n\n===New ownership (2005)===\nIn December 2004, owners of the individual National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) teams announced a plan intended to transition operations of National Pro Fastpitch from the founding Cowles family to an operating group consisting of team owners.\n\nThe efforts of the new ownership group in 2005 focused on solidifying broadcast agreements locally and nationally, soliciting sponsorship support, and aligning with national softball associations to bring meaningful competition to each team market and various grassroots events across the country. The group continues to recruit new teams and strengthen team ownership in each market.\n\nThe [[2005 National Pro Fastpitch season|2005 regular season]] included a total of 144 games and 23 opponents including six NPF teams, plus women's ASA major teams and international teams such as [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Venezuela]], [[China]], and [[Australia]]. The season concluded the last weekend in August when the [[Akron Racers]] beat the [[Chicago Bandits]] 5\u20134 in extra innings to claim the NPF Championship Title.\n\nThe Juggernaut joined forces with Telecare to broadcast six games in 2005. Telecare reaches almost a million homes in the Long Island area. Comcast SportsNet Chicago aired seven original broadcasts of Chicago Bandits games in 2005. ESPN2 aired two games during the NPF Championship series. The final game was broadcast on ESPN2 with a very impressive .48 rating.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia Force]] and the [[Connecticut Brakettes]] joined NPF for the [[2006 National Pro Fastpitch season|2006 season]]. The Brakettes, the Akron Racers, the 2005 Regular Season Champions, the Chicago Bandits, the New England Riptide, the [[Arizona Heat]], the [[Texas Thunder]] competed in league play during 2006. The New England Riptide defeated the Connecticut Brakettes to become champions.\n\nFor the [[2007 National Pro Fastpitch season|2007 season]], The Texas Thunder moved to Rockford, Illinois to play as the [[Rockford Thunder]]. The Connecticut Brakettes left the NPF to return to exclusive amateur status. The [[Washington Glory]] was established as a new franchise, picking up many of the former Brakettes' pro players. The Arizona Heat franchise was officially suspended.\n\nEach of the six established NPF teams played an official schedule of 44 games during 2007, including games against non-league opponents that counted in the NPF standings. The [[Michigan Ice]] played a more limited schedule as a provisional NPF team. Non-league opponents included Team China, Denso Japan, the Venezuela national team, and the Stratford Brakettes.\n\nThe league moved its playoffs to Kimberly, Wisconsin in a double-elimination format.  Washington was the only team in the playoffs to go undefeated and won the championship in the first game on August 26.  Rains on August 24 prevented the first day of competition to be played so all Friday games were played Saturday morning/afternoon and the scheduled Saturday games were pushed later into the evening.  [[Monica Abbott]] and [[Cat Osterman]] threw no-hitters during the championship weekend.\n\nIn [[2008 National Pro Fastpitch season|2008]], the league saw the addition of four more games as different international opponents appeared on the schedule and every team played in every other league city.  The international opponents included Canada, Venezuela, Chinese Taipei, and Netherlands.  Each team played two home series against two of the four international opponents.\n\nThe league also hosted Battle of the Bats throughout the 2008 season.  At every Saturday night home game, or a selected date if a series is not played on a Saturday night, four players from each team were selected to represent a different bat manufacturer in a home-run-hitting contest.  The contest puts manufacturer against manufacturer and player against player in a competition that concluded in Kimberly, Wisconsin as part of the championship weekend.\n\n===Contraction and expansion (2009\u2013present) ===\nThe [[New England Riptide]] did not play the [[2009 National Pro Fastpitch season|2009 season]], citing economic reasons.<ref>{{cite web | title = Riptide to Suspend Play for 2009 | work = New England Riptide | date = 2009-03-06 | url = http://www.neriptide.com/news/?id=6226 | accessdate = 2009-02-15 }}</ref> The Washington Glory folded outright and were replaced by the [[USSSA Pride]].\n\nFor [[2011 National Pro Fastpitch season|2011]], the Diamonds became a traveling team, and the Pride split home games between two new venues.<ref>{{cite web|title=NPF Announces 2011 Schedule|url=http://www.profastpitch.com/news/npfnews/index.html?article_id=1497|website=ProFastpitch.com|accessdate=15 May 2011|date=13 January 2011}}</ref>  In [[2012 National Pro Fastpitch season|2012]], the Diamonds relocated to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and became the Carolina Diamonds.

traces its origins back to the first professional softball league. Former [[LPGA Tour]] member Janie Blaylock, softball legend [[Joan Joyce]], tennis icon [[Billie Jean King]], sports entrepreneur [[Jim Jorgensen]] and [[Dennis Murphy (ice hockey)|Dennis Murphy]] co-founder of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] and [[World TeamTennis|WTT]] leagues, founded the International Women's Professional Softball Association (IWPSA) in 1976. The league featured 10 teams in cities across the nation, including [[Meriden, Connecticut]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Prescott, Arizona]], and [[San Jose, California]].  In the IWPSA's first season, each team played a 120-game schedule that featured 60 doubleheaders.\n\nThe fledgling association survived four seasons before lack of funds, high travel costs, and inadequate facilities ultimately led to its demise.\n\n==== Teams ====\n* Arizona/Phoenix Bird (1976)\n* Buffalo Breskis (1976\u201379)\n* Chicago Bandits (1976)\n* Connecticut Falcons (1976\u201379)\n* Michigan Travelers (1976)\n* Pennsylvania Liberties (1976)\n* Santa Ana Lionettes (1976\u201377)\n* San Diego Sandpipers (1976)\n* San Jose Sunbirds (1976\u201378); San Jose Rainbows (1979)\n* Southern California Gems (1976)\n* Bakersfield Aggies (1977)\n* St. Louis Hummers (1977\u201379)\n* Edmonton Snowbirds (1979)\n* New York Adventurers (1979)\n\n==== Championships ====\n;1976\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: San Jose Sunbirds\n\n;1977\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: Santa Anna Lionettes\n\n;1978\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: St. Louis Hummers\n\n;1979\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: St. Louis Hummers\n\n=== Following the IWPSA ===\nIn 1982, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] began to sanction the [[Women's College World Series]], a move that led to increased participation and exposure for the sport.\n\nInternationally, the [[United States women's national softball team|USA Softball Women's national team]] won back-to-back gold medals at the 1986 [[ISF Women's World Championship]] and the [[1987 Pan American Games]]. The college game also benefited from rule changes enacted in 1987 that increased the game's offensive output and ultimately its popularity.\n\n=== Women's Professional Softball League ===\nFormer [[Utah State University]] softball player Jane Cowles and her collegiate coach, [[John Horan (softball coach)|John Horan]], developed a plan for a women's professional fastpitch softball league. In February 1989, Cowles introduced a blueprint for the league to her parents Sage and [[John Cowles, Jr.]], owners of the [[Cowles Media Company]], who agreed to provide financial backing for the endeavor.\n\nField research and market studies began later that fall and continued to take place into 1993. In January 1994, plans for a barnstorming tour were announced, and 18 months later two teams, the Blaze and the Storm, composed of former collegiate all-stars played exhibition games in cities throughout the Midwest. Eight years of research and planning finally culminated in May 1997, with the Cowles family and title sponsor [[AT&T]] Wireless Services launching Women's Pro Fastpitch (WPF). The League began with six teams: Orlando Wahoos, Tampa Bay Firestix, Georgia Pride (later the Akron-based Ohio Pride),<ref name=\"db\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalballparks.com/NPF/Firestone_640_9.html|title=Firestone Stadium - Akron Ohio - Home of the Akron Racers - NPF Professional Softball League|author=|date=|website=www.digitalballparks.com}}</ref> Carolina Diamonds, Durham Dragons, and Virginia Roadsters.\n\n====WPF Championships====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Results<ref name=\"dimitry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/iwpsa.html|title=Steve Dimitry's IWPSA Web Page|accessdate=2009-10-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020022547/http://geocities.com/Colosseum/Arena/6925/iwpsa.html|archivedate=2009-10-20}}</ref>\n!

The Orlando Wahoos moved to Akron, Ohio and become the [[Akron Racers]], the only team which still remains in the league today.<ref name=\"db\" />\n\nThe WPSL consisted of four teams located in the [[Eastern United States]] in 2000. The world's most talented fastpitch softball players, including former Olympians, collegiate All-Americans, and all-conference selections highlighted the 15-player rosters of the league's four squads. The Akron Racers, Florida Wahoos,<ref group=\"n\">This version was a new expansion team in [[Plant City, Florida]], unrelated to the previous ''Orlando'' Wahoos that became the Akron Racers ([http://www.digitalballparks.com/NPF/Firestone_640_9.html ref])</ref> Ohio Pride, and the Tampa Bay FireStix each participated in the WPSL regular season. The Florida Wahoos defeated the Ohio Pride in the championship series held in [[Springfield, Missouri]].\n\n{{Details|2001 Women's Pro Softball League season}}\nThe 2001 \"Tour of Fastpitch Champions\" allowed the WPSL to focus on expansion. The 2001 tour traveled to 11 cities that were targeted as WPSL expansion candidates. Competition featured games between the WPSL Gold and All-Star teams as well as Canada, the USA National Teams, and local all-star teams. Nine of these games were televised, seven on [[ESPN2]] and two \"live\" on [[ESPN]], a first for the WPSL. The season was deemed a success with more than three million households witnessing a WPSL game. Numerous cities are also being developed for future ownership in the league.\n\n{{Details|2002 Women's Pro Softball League season}}\nPlay was suspended during the 2002 season to restructure the organization and allow the league additional time to develop and explore new expansion markets. However, a WPSL All-Star team competed in two exhibition games against the Tennessee All-Stars as part of the National Softball Association's A division Eastern World Series in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].

[[Major League Baseball]] partnered with NPF as its Official Development\nPartner as a continuation of MLB's efforts to connect with female athletes and women in general.\n\nAs \"Official Development Partner\" in 2003, Major League Baseball provided introductions to Major League Baseball Clubs, community partners, broadcast partners and to [http://www.mlb.com MLB.com].\n\n{{Details|2003 National Pro Fastpitch season}}\nAs part of its long-term sales, marketing and promotional campaign, NPF featured an All-Star Tour in 2003. The tour provided each of the league's expansion team owners with tools to lay the groundwork in their marketplace for the official launch of league play in 2004.\n\nIn 2004, the league relaunched with six teams in six markets:  [[California Sunbirds]] in [[Stockton, California]]; [[Arizona Heat]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]]; [[Texas Thunder]] in [[Houston, Texas]]; [[Akron Racers]] in [[Akron, Ohio]] ; [[New England Riptide]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]; and [[NY/NJ Juggernaut]] in [[Montclair, New Jersey]].\n\nThe [[2004 National Pro Fastpitch season|2004 season]] was distinguished by 178 league-wide games, 96 of the best female softball players in the country, the continued support of Major League Baseball as the Official Development Partner of NPF in the category of women's fastpitch softball, NPF playoffs (both best of three series went three games) and the inaugural NPF Championship with the [[New York/New Jersey Juggernaut]] capturing the Championship Cowles Cup with a victory over the [[New England Riptide]], fourth-place finisher in the regular season.\n\n===New ownership (2005)===\nIn December 2004, owners of the individual National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) teams announced a plan intended to transition operations of National Pro Fastpitch from the founding Cowles family to an operating group consisting of team owners.\n\nThe efforts of the new ownership group in 2005 focused on solidifying broadcast agreements locally and nationally, soliciting sponsorship support, and aligning with national softball associations to bring meaningful competition to each team market and various grassroots events across the country. The group continues to recruit new teams and strengthen team ownership in each market.\n\nThe [[2005 National Pro Fastpitch season|2005 regular season]] included a total of 144 games and 23 opponents including six NPF teams, plus women's ASA major teams and international teams such as [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Venezuela]], [[China]], and [[Australia]]. The season concluded the last weekend in August when the [[Akron Racers]] beat the [[Chicago Bandits]] 5\u20134 in extra innings to claim the NPF Championship Title.\n\nThe Juggernaut joined forces with Telecare to broadcast six games in 2005. Telecare reaches almost a million homes in the Long Island area. Comcast SportsNet Chicago aired seven original broadcasts of Chicago Bandits games in 2005. ESPN2 aired two games during the NPF Championship series. The final game was broadcast on ESPN2 with a very impressive .48 rating.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia Force]] and the [[Connecticut Brakettes]] joined NPF for the [[2006 National Pro Fastpitch season|2006 season]]. The Brakettes, the Akron Racers, the 2005 Regular Season Champions, the Chicago Bandits, the New England Riptide, the [[Arizona Heat]], the [[Texas Thunder]] competed in league play during 2006. The New England Riptide defeated the Connecticut Brakettes to become champions.\n\nFor the [[2007 National Pro Fastpitch season|2007 season]], The Texas Thunder moved to Rockford, Illinois to play as the [[Rockford Thunder]]. The Connecticut Brakettes left the NPF to return to exclusive amateur status. The [[Washington Glory]] was established as a new franchise, picking up many of the former Brakettes' pro players. The Arizona Heat franchise was officially suspended.\n\nEach of the six established NPF teams played an official schedule of 44 games during 2007, including games against non-league opponents that counted in the NPF standings. The [[Michigan Ice]] played a more limited schedule as a provisional NPF team. Non-league opponents included Team China, Denso Japan, the Venezuela national team, and the Stratford Brakettes.\n\nThe league moved its playoffs to Kimberly, Wisconsin in a double-elimination format.  Washington was the only team in the playoffs to go undefeated and won the championship in the first game on August 26.  Rains on August 24 prevented the first day of competition to be played so all Friday games were played Saturday morning/afternoon and the scheduled Saturday games were pushed later into the evening.  [[Monica Abbott]] and [[Cat Osterman]] threw no-hitters during the championship weekend.\n\nIn [[2008 National Pro Fastpitch season|2008]], the league saw the addition of four more games as different international opponents appeared on the schedule and every team played in every other league city.  The international opponents included Canada, Venezuela, Chinese Taipei, and Netherlands.  Each team played two home series against two of the four international opponents.\n\nThe league also hosted Battle of the Bats throughout the 2008 season.  At every Saturday night home game, or a selected date if a series is not played on a Saturday night, four players from each team were selected to represent a different bat manufacturer in a home-run-hitting contest.  The contest puts manufacturer against manufacturer and player against player in a competition that concluded in Kimberly, Wisconsin as part of the championship weekend.\n\n===Contraction and expansion (2009\u2013present) ===\nThe [[New England Riptide]] did not play the [[2009 National Pro Fastpitch season|2009 season]], citing economic reasons.<ref>{{cite web | title = Riptide to Suspend Play for 2009 | work = New England Riptide | date = 2009-03-06 | url = http://www.neriptide.com/news/?id=6226 | accessdate = 2009-02-15 }}</ref> The Washington Glory folded outright and were replaced by the [[USSSA Pride]].\n\nFor [[2011 National Pro Fastpitch season|2011]], the Diamonds became a traveling team, and the Pride split home games between two new venues.<ref>{{cite web|title=NPF Announces 2011 Schedule|url=http://www.profastpitch.com/news/npfnews/index.html?article_id=1497|website=ProFastpitch.com|accessdate=15 May 2011|date=13 January 2011}}</ref>  In [[2012 National Pro Fastpitch season|2012]], the Diamonds relocated to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and became the Carolina Diamonds.

traces its origins back to the first professional softball league. Former [[LPGA Tour]] member Janie Blaylock, softball legend [[Joan Joyce]], tennis icon [[Billie Jean King]], sports entrepreneur [[Jim Jorgensen]] and [[Dennis Murphy (ice hockey)|Dennis Murphy]] co-founder of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] and [[World TeamTennis|WTT]] leagues, founded the International Women's Professional Softball Association (IWPSA) in 1976. The league featured 10 teams in cities across the nation, including [[Meriden, Connecticut]], [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[Prescott, Arizona]], and [[San Jose, California]].  In the IWPSA's first season, each team played a 120-game schedule that featured 60 doubleheaders.\n\nThe fledgling association survived four seasons before lack of funds, high travel costs, and inadequate facilities ultimately led to its demise.\n\n==== Teams ====\n* Arizona/Phoenix Bird (1976)\n* Buffalo Breskis (1976\u201379)\n* Chicago Bandits (1976)\n* Connecticut Falcons (1976\u201379)\n* Michigan Travelers (1976)\n* Pennsylvania Liberties (1976)\n* Santa Ana Lionettes (1976\u201377)\n* San Diego Sandpipers (1976)\n* San Jose Sunbirds (1976\u201378); San Jose Rainbows (1979)\n* Southern California Gems (1976)\n* Bakersfield Aggies (1977)\n* St. Louis Hummers (1977\u201379)\n* Edmonton Snowbirds (1979)\n* New York Adventurers (1979)\n\n==== Championships ====\n;1976\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: San Jose Sunbirds\n\n;1977\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: Santa Anna Lionettes\n\n;1978\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: St. Louis Hummers\n\n;1979\n:Champion: Connecticut Falcons\n:Runner-up: St. Louis Hummers\n\n=== Following the IWPSA ===\nIn 1982, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] began to sanction the [[Women's College World Series]], a move that led to increased participation and exposure for the sport.\n\nInternationally, the [[United States women's national softball team|USA Softball Women's national team]] won back-to-back gold medals at the 1986 [[ISF Women's World Championship]] and the [[1987 Pan American Games]]. The college game also benefited from rule changes enacted in 1987 that increased the game's offensive output and ultimately its popularity.\n\n=== Women's Professional Softball League ===\nFormer [[Utah State University]] softball player Jane Cowles and her collegiate coach, [[John Horan (softball coach)|John Horan]], developed a plan for a women's professional fastpitch softball league. In February 1989, Cowles introduced a blueprint for the league to her parents Sage and [[John Cowles, Jr.]], owners of the [[Cowles Media Company]], who agreed to provide financial backing for the endeavor.\n\nField research and market studies began later that fall and continued to take place into 1993. In January 1994, plans for a barnstorming tour were announced, and 18 months later two teams, the Blaze and the Storm, composed of former collegiate all-stars played exhibition games in cities throughout the Midwest. Eight years of research and planning finally culminated in May 1997, with the Cowles family and title sponsor [[AT&T]] Wireless Services launching Women's Pro Fastpitch (WPF).

Nine of these games were televised, seven on [[ESPN2]] and two \"live\" on [[ESPN]], a first for the WPSL. The season was deemed a success with more than three million households witnessing a WPSL game. Numerous cities are also being developed for future ownership in the league.\n\n{{Details|2002 Women's Pro Softball League season}}\nPlay was suspended during the 2002 season to restructure the organization and allow the league additional time to develop and explore new expansion markets. However, a WPSL All-Star team competed in two exhibition games against the Tennessee All-Stars as part of the National Softball Association's A division Eastern World Series in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].

After conquering the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]], the [[Macedon]]ian king (and now the great king of the Persian Empire), Alexander, launched a campaign into the Indian subcontinent in present-day [[Pakistan]], part of which  formed the easternmost territories of the Achaemenid Empire following the [[Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley]] (6th century BC). The rationale for this campaign is usually said to be Alexander's desire to conquer the entire known world, which the Greeks thought ended in [[Indian Subcontinent|India]].\n\nAfter gaining control of the former Achaemenid [[satrapy]] of [[Gandhara]], including the city of [[Taxila]], Alexander advanced into [[Punjab]], where he engaged in battle against the regional king [[Porus]], whom Alexander defeated in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] in 326 BC,<ref name=\"Fuller pg 198\">Fuller, pg 198 <br>{{quote|\"While the battle raged, Craterus forced his way over the Haranpur ford.

It is now thy business to manage these matters; and the other Macedonians and Greeks will follow thee, young men in place of old, fresh men in place of exhausted ones, and men to whom warfare has no terrors, because up to the present time they have had no experience of it; and they will be eager to set out, from hope of future reward.''}}</ref> eventually relented,<ref>The Anabasis of Alexander by Arrian, Book VI, Chapter XXVIII - Alexander Resolves to Return{{primary source inline|date=February 2019}}\n<br>{{quote|''Alexander then broke up the conference, being annoyed at the freedom of speech in which Coenus indulged, and the hesitation displayed by the other officers.

Then indeed he collected the oldest of the Companions and especially those who were friendly to him, and as all things indicated the advisability of returning, he made known to the army that he had resolved to march back again.''}}</ref> being convinced that it was better to return. This caused Alexander to turn south, advancing through southern Punjab and [[Sindh]], along the way conquering more tribes along the lower [[Indus River]], before finally turning westward.<ref>The Anabasis of Alexander/Book V/Chapter XXVIII</ref>\n\nAlexander died in Babylon on 10 or 11 June 323 BC. In {{Circa|322 BC}}, one year after Alexander's death, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] of [[Magadha]] founded the [[Maurya Empire]] in India.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Sources ===\n\nOf those who accompanied Alexander to India, [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Onesicritus]], and [[Nearchus]] wrote about the Indian campaign.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=3}} The only surviving contemporary account of Alexander's Indian campaign is a report of the voyage of the [[navarch|naval commander]] Nearchus,{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=1}} who was tasked with exploring the coast between the Indus River and the [[Persian Gulf]].{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=3}} This report is preserved in [[Arrian]]'s ''[[The Anabasis of Alexander|Anabasis]]'' (c. AD 150). Arrian provides a detailed account of Alexander's campaigns, based on the writings of Alexander's companions and courtiers.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=1}}\n\nArrian's account is supplemented by the writings of other authors, whose works are also based on the accounts of Alexander's companions: these authors include [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] (c. 21 BC), [[Strabo]] (c. AD 23), and [[Plutarch]] (c. AD 119).{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=1-2}}\n\n=== Socio-political conditions in India ===\n\nAlexander's incursion into India was limited to the [[Indus River]] basin area, which was divided among several small states. These states appear to have been based on dominance of particular tribes, as the Greek writers mention tribes such as the [[Malloi]] as well as kings whose name seem to be tribal designations (such as [[Porus]] of [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru tribe]]). [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia [[Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley|held suzerainty]] over the Indus valley in the previous decades, but there was no trace of Achaemenid rule beyond the Indus river when Alexander's army arrived in the region.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=2-3}} [[Strabo]], sourcing his information from the earlier writer [[Eratosthenes]], states that the Achaemenid king controlled the area to the west of the Indus.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=32-33}} This area (including the [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]]-[[Gandhara]] region) was probably the territory of the Indians, who according to the Greek accounts, fought alongside their overlord [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=33}}\n\nGreek writings as well archaeological excavations indicate the existence of an urban economy dependent on agriculture and trade in the Indus basin. The Greeks mention the existence of cities and fortified towns such as [[Taxila]]. Arrian mentions that after defeating Porus, Alexander marched eastwards towards the [[Chenab River]], and captured 37 towns: the smallest of these towns had 5,000 or more inhabitants.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=2}} In the [[Swat River|Swat valley]], Alexander is said to have seized 230,000 oxen (possibly [[Zebu]]), intending to send them to Macedonia for [[plough]]ing land.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=1}} Aristobulus saw rice being grown in [[paddy field]]s, Onesicritus reported the existence of a crop called bosmoran (possibly the [[pearl millet]]), and Nearchus wrote of \"honey-yielding reeds\" (presumably the [[sugarcane]]).{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=1-2}} Nearchus also mentions that Indians wore clothes made of [[cotton]]. [[Rock salt]] was extracted from the [[Salt Range]], and supplied to other parts of India.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=2}} Some primitive communities existed in the forest, desert, and coastal regions of the subcontinent. For example, Nearchus mentions that people around the Tomeros river ([[Hingol River|Hingol]]) subsisted on fishing, and used stone tools instead of iron ones.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=2}}\n\nThe Greek writers mention the priestly class of [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (as \"Brachmanes\"), who are described as teachers of Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=3}} They do not refer to the existence of any religious temples or idols in India, although such references commonly occur in their descriptions of Alexander's campaigns in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Iran. This suggests that temples and idols were not a feature of the Indian religious practice yet. Greek accounts mention naked ascetics called [[gymnosophists]]. A philosopher named Calanus (probably a Greek transcription of the Indian name \"Kalyana\") accompanied Alexander to [[Persepolis]], where he committed suicide on a public funeral pyre: he was probably a Jain or an [[Ajivika]] monk. Curiously, there is no reference to [[Buddhism]] in the Greek accounts.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=4}}\n\nOther than their mention of the Brahmanas, the Greek narratives about Alexander's invasion do not directly mention the [[Indian caste system|caste system]]. Some Brahmanas acted as advisors to local princes: Alexander had groups of Brahmanas hanged in present-day [[Sindh]] for instigating the rulers Musicanus and Sambus to revolt against him. The Greek writings attest the existence of slavery in at least two places: Onesicritus describes slavery in the territory ruled by Musicanus, and Aristobulus mentions poor people selling their daughters publicly in Taxila. Aristobulus also observed [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], the practice of widows immolating themselves on their husbands' pyre, at Taxila. The practice of exposing dead bodies to vultures, similar to the [[Magian]] practice of [[Tower of Silence]], was also prevalent in Taxila.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=3}}\n\nNearchus mentions that Indians wrote letters on closely-woven cloth; it is possible that this is a reference to a precursor of the [[Kharoshthi]] script, which may have developed from the [[Aramaic alphabet]] during the Achaemenid rule.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=3}} While describing a tribe on the coast of present-day [[Balochistan]], Nearchus mentions that they were different from Indians in \"their language and customs\", which implies that he associated a particular language with the Indians.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=3-4}} This does not mean that the Indians spoke a single language: the language that Nearchus associated with India might have been a [[lingua franca]] used for official and commercial purposes. This lingua franca was most probably the [[Gandhari Prakrit]], as the Greek names (e.g. \"Taxila\" and \"[[Chandragupta Maurya|Sandrokottus]]\") for Indian people and places seem to be derived from this language (e.g. \"Takhasila\" and \"Chandagutta\") rather than [[Sanskrit]] (e.g. \"Takshashila\" and \"Chandragupta\").{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=4}}\n\nNearchus attests the existence of [[medical science]] in India: he mentions that when the Greek physicians failed to provide remedies for snake-bites to [[Alexander]], the king gathered Indian healers who were also able to cure other diseases and painful conditions. The Greek accounts do not mention any other sciences of contemporary India.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=4}}\n\n=== Alexander's preparation ===\n\n[[File:Indian warriors (Sattagydian, Gandharan, Hindush) circa 480 BCE in the Naqsh-e Roastam reliefs of Xerxes I.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient India]]n warriors (from left to right: [[Sattagydian]], [[Gandharan]], [[Hindush]]) circa 480 BC.

For Alexander, the invasion of India was a natural consequence of his subjugation of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], as the areas of the [[Indus valley]] had long been under Achaemenid control, since the [[Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley]] circa 515 BC.<ref name=RE>The Achaemenid Empire in South Asia and Recent Excavations in Akra in Northwest Pakistan Peter Magee, Cameron Petrie, Robert Knox, Farid Khan, Ken Thomas [https://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=arch_pubs p.714]</ref> Alexander was only taking possession of territories which he had obtained from the Achaemenids, and now considered rightfully his own.<ref name=RE/>\n\nAlexander invited all the chieftains of the former satrapy of [[Gandhara]], to come to him and submit to his authority. [[Ambhi]] (Greek: Omphis), ruler of [[Taxila]], whose kingdom extended from the [[Indus]] to the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] (Greek: Hydaspes), complied. At the end of the spring of 327 BC, Alexander started on his Indian expedition leaving Amyntas behind with 3,500 horse and 10,000 foot soldiers to hold the land of the [[Bactrians]].{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=46}}\n\n==Cophen Campaign==\n{{Main|Cophen Campaign}}\nAlexander personally took command of the shield-bearing guards, foot-companions, archers, Agrianians, and horse-javelin-men and led them against the [[clan]]s{{snd}}the [[Aspasioi]] of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the Guraeus ([[Panjkora]]) valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat River|Swat]] and [[Buner]] valleys.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAlexander faced resistance from Hastin (or Astes), chief of the Ilastinayana (called the Astakenoi or Astanenoi) tribe, whose capital was Pushkalavati or Peukelaotis.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=24}} He later defeated Asvayanas and Asvakayanas and captured their 40,000 men and 230,000 oxen. Asvakayanas of [[Massaga]] fought him under the command of their queen, [[Cleophis]], with an army of 30,000 cavalry, 38,000 infantry, 30 elephants, and 7,000 mercenaries. Other regions that fought Alexander were Abhisara, [[Aornos]], [[Bazira]], and Ora or Dyrta.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|p=25}}{{sfn|Ian Worthington|2003|p=162}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Narain, A.

Alexander followed close behind their heels and besieged the strategic hill-fort. The Siege of Aornos was Alexander's last siege, \"the climax to Alexander's career as the greatest besieger in history\", according to Robin Lane Fox.{{sfn|Robin Lane Fox|1973|p=343}} The siege took place in April 326{{nbsp}}BC.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=54}} It presented the last threat to Alexander's supply line, which stretched, dangerously vulnerable, over the [[Hindu Kush]] back to [[Balkh]], though [[Arrian]] credits Alexander's heroic desire to outdo his kinsman [[Heracles]], who allegedly had proved unable to take the place Pir-Sar, which the Greeks called Aornis. The site lies north of [[Attock]] in what is now the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]], on a strongly reinforced mountain spur above the narrow gorges in a bend of the upper [[Indus]]. Neighboring tribesmen who surrendered to Alexander offered to lead him to the best point of access.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAt the vulnerable north side leading to the fort, Alexander and his catapults were stopped by a deep ravine. To bring the siege engines within reach, an earthwork mound was constructed to bridge the ravine. A low hill connected to the nearest tip of Pir-Sar was soon within reach and taken.

The Hydaspes was the last major battle fought by Alexander.<ref>P.H.L. Eggermont, ''Alexander's campaign in Southern Punjab'' (1993).</ref> The main train went into what is now modern-day Pakistan through the [[Khyber Pass]], but a smaller force under the personal command of Alexander went via the northern route, resulting in the Siege of Aornos along the way. In early spring of the next year, he combined his forces and allied with [[Taxiles]] (also Ambhi), the King of [[Taxila]], against his neighbor, the King of [[Hydaspes]].\n\n[[File:Porus awaits the attack of Alexander july 326 B.C..jpg|thumb|left|Porus awaits the attack of Alexander, July, 326 BC.]]\nPorus was a regional King in India. Arrian writes about Porus, in his own words:\n{{quote|One of the Indian Kings called Porus, a man remarkable alike for his personal strength and noble courage, on hearing the report about Alexander, began to prepare for the inevitable. Accordingly, when hostilities broke out, he ordered his army to attack Macedonians from whom he demanded their king, as if he was his private enemy. Alexander lost no time in joining battle, but his horse being wounded in the first charge, he fell headlong to the ground, and was saved by his attendants who hastened up to his assistance.}}\n\nPorus drew up on the south bank of the Jhelum River, and was set to repel any crossings. The Jhelum River was deep and fast enough that any opposed crossing would probably doom the entire attacking force. Alexander knew that a direct crossing would fail, so he found a suitable crossing, about {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} upstream of his camp. The name of the place is \"Kadee\". Alexander left his general Craterus behind with most of the army while he crossed the river upstream with a strong contingent. Porus sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son to the crossing.\n\nAccording to sources{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}, Alexander had already encountered Porus's son, so the two men were not strangers. Porus's son killed Alexander's horse with one blow, and Alexander fell to the ground. Also writing about this encounter, Arrian adds, {{quote|Other writers state that there was a fight at the actual landing between Alexander's cavalry and a force of Indians commanded by Porus's son, who was there ready to oppose them with superior numbers, and that in the course of fighting he (Porus's son) wounded Alexander with his own hand and struck the blow which killed his (Alexander's) beloved horse Buccaphalus.}}\n[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|\"Victory coin\" of Alexander the Great, minted in [[Babylon]] c.{{nbsp}}322 BC, following his campaigns in the Indian subcontinent.

[[British Museum]].]]\nThe force was easily routed, and according to Arrian, Porus' son was killed. Porus now saw that the crossing force was larger than he had expected, and decided to face it with the bulk of his army. Porus's army were poised with cavalry on both flanks, the [[war elephants]] in front, and infantry behind the elephants. These war elephants presented an especially difficult situation for Alexander, as they scared the Macedonian horses.\n\nAlexander started the battle by sending horse archers to shower the Porus's left cavalry wing, and then used his cavalry to destroy Porus's cavalry. Meanwhile, the [[Macedonian phalanx]]es had crossed the river to engage the charge of the war elephants. The Macedonians eventually surrounded Porus's force.\n\nDiodorus wrote about the battle tactics of war elephants:{{quote|Upon this the elephants, applying to good use their prodigious size and strength, killed some of the enemy by trampling under their feet, and crushing their armour and their bones, while upon other they inflicted a terrible death, for they first lifted them aloft with their trunks, which they twisted round their bodies and then dashed them down with great violence to the ground. Many others they deprived in a moment of life by goring them through and through with their tusks.}}\n\nThe fighting style of Porus' soldiers was described in detail by Arrian:{{quote|The foot soldiers carry a bow made of equal length with the man who bears it. This they rest upon the ground, and pressing against it with their left foot thus discharges the arrow, having drawn the string far backwards for the shaft they use is little short for three yards long, and there is nothing can resist an Indian archer's shot, neither shield nor breast plate, nor any stronger defence if such there be.<ref name=\"BriefLife120\" />}}\n\nAccording to Curtius Quintus, Alexander towards the end of the day sent a few ambassadors to Porus:{{quote|Alexander, anxious to save the life of this great and gallant soldier, sent Texile the Indian to him (to Porus). Texile rode up as near as he dared and requested him to stop his elephant and hear what message Alexander sent him, escape was no longer possible. But Texiles was an old enemy of the Indian King, and Porus turned his elephant and drove at him, to kill him with his lance; and he might indeed have killed him, if he had not spurred his horse out of the way in the nick of the time. Alexander, however, far from resenting this treatment of his messenger, sent a number of others, last of whom was Indian named Meroes, a man he had been told had long been Porus' friend.<ref name=\"BriefLife120\" />}}\n\nAccording to Plutarch this was one of Alexander's hardest battles:{{quote|The combat then was of a more mixed kind; but maintained with such obstinacy, that it was not decided till the eighth hour of the day.}} Plutarch also wrote that the bitter fighting of the Hydaspes made Alexander's men hesitant to continue on with the conquest of India, considering that they would potentially face far larger armies than those of Porus if they were to cross the Ganges River.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPorus was one of many local kings who impressed Alexander. Wounded in his shoulder, standing over {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, but still on his feet, he was asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated. \"Treat me, Alexander, the way a King treats another King\", Porus responded.

AD 119).{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=1-2}}\n\n=== Socio-political conditions in India ===\n\nAlexander's incursion into India was limited to the [[Indus River]] basin area, which was divided among several small states. These states appear to have been based on dominance of particular tribes, as the Greek writers mention tribes such as the [[Malloi]] as well as kings whose name seem to be tribal designations (such as [[Porus]] of [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru tribe]]). [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia [[Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley|held suzerainty]] over the Indus valley in the previous decades, but there was no trace of Achaemenid rule beyond the Indus river when Alexander's army arrived in the region.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=2-3}} [[Strabo]], sourcing his information from the earlier writer [[Eratosthenes]], states that the Achaemenid king controlled the area to the west of the Indus.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=32-33}} This area (including the [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]]-[[Gandhara]] region) was probably the territory of the Indians, who according to the Greek accounts, fought alongside their overlord [[Darius III]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=33}}\n\nGreek writings as well archaeological excavations indicate the existence of an urban economy dependent on agriculture and trade in the Indus basin. The Greeks mention the existence of cities and fortified towns such as [[Taxila]]. Arrian mentions that after defeating Porus, Alexander marched eastwards towards the [[Chenab River]], and captured 37 towns: the smallest of these towns had 5,000 or more inhabitants.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=2}} In the [[Swat River|Swat valley]], Alexander is said to have seized 230,000 oxen (possibly [[Zebu]]), intending to send them to Macedonia for [[plough]]ing land.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=1}} Aristobulus saw rice being grown in [[paddy field]]s, Onesicritus reported the existence of a crop called bosmoran (possibly the [[pearl millet]]), and Nearchus wrote of \"honey-yielding reeds\" (presumably the [[sugarcane]]).{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=1-2}} Nearchus also mentions that Indians wore clothes made of [[cotton]]. [[Rock salt]] was extracted from the [[Salt Range]], and supplied to other parts of India.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=2}} Some primitive communities existed in the forest, desert, and coastal regions of the subcontinent. For example, Nearchus mentions that people around the Tomeros river ([[Hingol River|Hingol]]) subsisted on fishing, and used stone tools instead of iron ones.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=2}}\n\nThe Greek writers mention the priestly class of [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (as \"Brachmanes\"), who are described as teachers of Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=3}} They do not refer to the existence of any religious temples or idols in India, although such references commonly occur in their descriptions of Alexander's campaigns in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Iran. This suggests that temples and idols were not a feature of the Indian religious practice yet. Greek accounts mention naked ascetics called [[gymnosophists]]. A philosopher named Calanus (probably a Greek transcription of the Indian name \"Kalyana\") accompanied Alexander to [[Persepolis]], where he committed suicide on a public funeral pyre: he was probably a Jain or an [[Ajivika]] monk. Curiously, there is no reference to [[Buddhism]] in the Greek accounts.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=4}}\n\nOther than their mention of the Brahmanas, the Greek narratives about Alexander's invasion do not directly mention the [[Indian caste system|caste system]]. Some Brahmanas acted as advisors to local princes: Alexander had groups of Brahmanas hanged in present-day [[Sindh]] for instigating the rulers Musicanus and Sambus to revolt against him. The Greek writings attest the existence of slavery in at least two places: Onesicritus describes slavery in the territory ruled by Musicanus, and Aristobulus mentions poor people selling their daughters publicly in Taxila. Aristobulus also observed [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], the practice of widows immolating themselves on their husbands' pyre, at Taxila. The practice of exposing dead bodies to vultures, similar to the [[Magian]] practice of [[Tower of Silence]], was also prevalent in Taxila.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=3}}\n\nNearchus mentions that Indians wrote letters on closely-woven cloth; it is possible that this is a reference to a precursor of the [[Kharoshthi]] script, which may have developed from the [[Aramaic alphabet]] during the Achaemenid rule.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=3}} While describing a tribe on the coast of present-day [[Balochistan]], Nearchus mentions that they were different from Indians in \"their language and customs\", which implies that he associated a particular language with the Indians.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|pp=3-4}} This does not mean that the Indians spoke a single language: the language that Nearchus associated with India might have been a [[lingua franca]] used for official and commercial purposes. This lingua franca was most probably the [[Gandhari Prakrit]], as the Greek names (e.g. \"Taxila\" and \"[[Chandragupta Maurya|Sandrokottus]]\") for Indian people and places seem to be derived from this language (e.g. \"Takhasila\" and \"Chandagutta\") rather than [[Sanskrit]] (e.g. \"Takshashila\" and \"Chandragupta\").{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=4}}\n\nNearchus attests the existence of [[medical science]] in India: he mentions that when the Greek physicians failed to provide remedies for snake-bites to [[Alexander]], the king gathered Indian healers who were also able to cure other diseases and painful conditions. The Greek accounts do not mention any other sciences of contemporary India.{{sfn|Irfan Habib|Vivekanand Jha|2004|p=4}}\n\n=== Alexander's preparation ===\n\n[[File:Indian warriors (Sattagydian, Gandharan, Hindush) circa 480 BCE in the Naqsh-e Roastam reliefs of Xerxes I.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient India]]n warriors (from left to right: [[Sattagydian]], [[Gandharan]], [[Hindush]]) circa 480 BC.

Alexander followed close behind their heels and besieged the strategic hill-fort. The Siege of Aornos was Alexander's last siege, \"the climax to Alexander's career as the greatest besieger in history\", according to Robin Lane Fox.{{sfn|Robin Lane Fox|1973|p=343}} The siege took place in April 326{{nbsp}}BC.{{sfn|H. C. Raychaudhuri|1988|p=54}} It presented the last threat to Alexander's supply line, which stretched, dangerously vulnerable, over the [[Hindu Kush]] back to [[Balkh]], though [[Arrian]] credits Alexander's heroic desire to outdo his kinsman [[Heracles]], who allegedly had proved unable to take the place Pir-Sar, which the Greeks called Aornis. The site lies north of [[Attock]] in what is now the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]], on a strongly reinforced mountain spur above the narrow gorges in a bend of the upper [[Indus]]. Neighboring tribesmen who surrendered to Alexander offered to lead him to the best point of access.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAt the vulnerable north side leading to the fort, Alexander and his catapults were stopped by a deep ravine. To bring the siege engines within reach, an earthwork mound was constructed to bridge the ravine. A low hill connected to the nearest tip of Pir-Sar was soon within reach and taken. Alexander's troops were at first repelled by boulders rolled down from above. Three days of drumbeats marked the defenders' celebration of the initial repulse, followed by a surprise retreat. Hauling himself up the last rockface on a rope, Alexander cleared the summit, slaying some fugitives{{snd}}inflated by Arrian to a massacre<ref name=\"BriefLife120\" />{{snd}}and erected altars to [[Athena|Athena Nike]], Athena of Victory, traces of which were identified by Stein. ''Sisikottos'', or [[Sa\u015bigupta]], who had helped Alexander in this campaign, was made the governor of Aornos.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Punjab==\nAfter reducing Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus to begin campaigning in the [[Punjab region]].\n\n===Battle of the Hydaspes River===\n{{main|Battle of the Hydaspes}}\n[[File:Le Brun, Alexander and Porus.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>A painting by [[Charles Le Brun]] depicting Alexander and Porus (Puru) during the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]].</center>]]\n\nThe [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]] was fought by Alexander in July 326{{nbsp}}BC against king [[King Porus|Porus]] (possibly, [[Paurava]]) on the [[Hydaspes]] River ([[Jhelum River]]) in the [[Punjab]], near [[Bhera]]. The Hydaspes was the last major battle fought by Alexander.<ref>P.H.L. Eggermont, ''Alexander's campaign in Southern Punjab'' (1993).</ref> The main train went into what is now modern-day Pakistan through the [[Khyber Pass]], but a smaller force under the personal command of Alexander went via the northern route, resulting in the Siege of Aornos along the way. In early spring of the next year, he combined his forces and allied with [[Taxiles]] (also Ambhi), the King of [[Taxila]], against his neighbor, the King of [[Hydaspes]].\n\n[[File:Porus awaits the attack of Alexander july 326 B.C..jpg|thumb|left|Porus awaits the attack of Alexander, July, 326 BC.]]\nPorus was a regional King in India. Arrian writes about Porus, in his own words:\n{{quote|One of the Indian Kings called Porus, a man remarkable alike for his personal strength and noble courage, on hearing the report about Alexander, began to prepare for the inevitable. Accordingly, when hostilities broke out, he ordered his army to attack Macedonians from whom he demanded their king, as if he was his private enemy. Alexander lost no time in joining battle, but his horse being wounded in the first charge, he fell headlong to the ground, and was saved by his attendants who hastened up to his assistance.}}\n\nPorus drew up on the south bank of the Jhelum River, and was set to repel any crossings. The Jhelum River was deep and fast enough that any opposed crossing would probably doom the entire attacking force. Alexander knew that a direct crossing would fail, so he found a suitable crossing, about {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} upstream of his camp. The name of the place is \"Kadee\". Alexander left his general Craterus behind with most of the army while he crossed the river upstream with a strong contingent. Porus sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son to the crossing.\n\nAccording to sources{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}, Alexander had already encountered Porus's son, so the two men were not strangers. Porus's son killed Alexander's horse with one blow, and Alexander fell to the ground. Also writing about this encounter, Arrian adds, {{quote|Other writers state that there was a fight at the actual landing between Alexander's cavalry and a force of Indians commanded by Porus's son, who was there ready to oppose them with superior numbers, and that in the course of fighting he (Porus's son) wounded Alexander with his own hand and struck the blow which killed his (Alexander's) beloved horse Buccaphalus.}}\n[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|\"Victory coin\" of Alexander the Great, minted in [[Babylon]] c.{{nbsp}}322 BC, following his campaigns in the Indian subcontinent.

[[British Museum]].]]\nThe force was easily routed, and according to Arrian, Porus' son was killed. Porus now saw that the crossing force was larger than he had expected, and decided to face it with the bulk of his army. Porus's army were poised with cavalry on both flanks, the [[war elephants]] in front, and infantry behind the elephants. These war elephants presented an especially difficult situation for Alexander, as they scared the Macedonian horses.\n\nAlexander started the battle by sending horse archers to shower the Porus's left cavalry wing, and then used his cavalry to destroy Porus's cavalry. Meanwhile, the [[Macedonian phalanx]]es had crossed the river to engage the charge of the war elephants. The Macedonians eventually surrounded Porus's force.\n\nDiodorus wrote about the battle tactics of war elephants:{{quote|Upon this the elephants, applying to good use their prodigious size and strength, killed some of the enemy by trampling under their feet, and crushing their armour and their bones, while upon other they inflicted a terrible death, for they first lifted them aloft with their trunks, which they twisted round their bodies and then dashed them down with great violence to the ground. Many others they deprived in a moment of life by goring them through and through with their tusks.}}\n\nThe fighting style of Porus' soldiers was described in detail by Arrian:{{quote|The foot soldiers carry a bow made of equal length with the man who bears it. This they rest upon the ground, and pressing against it with their left foot thus discharges the arrow, having drawn the string far backwards for the shaft they use is little short for three yards long, and there is nothing can resist an Indian archer's shot, neither shield nor breast plate, nor any stronger defence if such there be.<ref name=\"BriefLife120\" />}}\n\nAccording to Curtius Quintus, Alexander towards the end of the day sent a few ambassadors to Porus:{{quote|Alexander, anxious to save the life of this great and gallant soldier, sent Texile the Indian to him (to Porus). Texile rode up as near as he dared and requested him to stop his elephant and hear what message Alexander sent him, escape was no longer possible. But Texiles was an old enemy of the Indian King, and Porus turned his elephant and drove at him, to kill him with his lance; and he might indeed have killed him, if he had not spurred his horse out of the way in the nick of the time. Alexander, however, far from resenting this treatment of his messenger, sent a number of others, last of whom was Indian named Meroes, a man he had been told had long been Porus' friend.<ref name=\"BriefLife120\" />}}\n\nAccording to Plutarch this was one of Alexander's hardest battles:{{quote|The combat then was of a more mixed kind; but maintained with such obstinacy, that it was not decided till the eighth hour of the day.}} Plutarch also wrote that the bitter fighting of the Hydaspes made Alexander's men hesitant to continue on with the conquest of India, considering that they would potentially face far larger armies than those of Porus if they were to cross the Ganges River.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPorus was one of many local kings who impressed Alexander. Wounded in his shoulder, standing over {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, but still on his feet, he was asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated. \"Treat me, Alexander, the way a King treats another King\", Porus responded.
