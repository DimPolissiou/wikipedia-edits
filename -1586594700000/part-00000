After that, Kiyomasa built [[Kumamoto Castle]]. Due to its many innovative defensive designs, Kumamoto Castle was considered impregnable, and Kiyomasa enjoyed a reputation as one of the finest castle-builders in Japanese history. After Kiyomasa died in 1611, his son, Tadahiro, succeeded him. Tadahiro was removed by [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] in 1632, replacing him with the [[Hosokawa clan]]. The current administrative body of the City of Kumamoto was founded on April 1, 1889.\n\nNear the end of World War II, on July 1, 1945, Kumamoto was bombed in an [[Air raids on Japan|Allied air raid]], which destroyed a square mile, 20% of the city's area.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Craven|first=Wesley|author2=Cate, James (editors)|title=The Pacific: Matterhorn to Nagasaki|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=1953|series=The Army Air Forces in World War II.

The ''[[donjon]]'' (castle central keep) is a concrete reconstruction built in the 1970s, but several ancillary wooden buildings remain of the original castle, which was assaulted during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] and sacked and burned after a 53-day [[siege]]. It was during this time that the tradition of eating ''[[Horse meat|basashi]]'' (raw horse meat) originated. ''Basashi'' remains popular in Kumamoto and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in Japan, though these days it is usually considered a delicacy.\n\nWithin the outer walls of Kumamoto Castle is the Hosokawa Gyobu-tei, the former residence of the Higo ''[[daimy\u014d]]''. This traditional wooden mansion has a fine [[Japanese garden]] located on its grounds.\n\n[[Miyamoto Musashi]] lived the last part of his life in Kumamoto. His tomb and the cave where he resided during his final years (known as [[Reigand\u014d]], or \"spirit rock cave\") is situated close by. He penned the famous ''Go Rin no Sho'' (''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'') whilst living here.\n\nKumamoto is also home to [[Suizen-ji J\u014dju-en]], a formal garden neighboring Suizenji Temple approximately 3 kilometers southeast of Kumamoto Castle.\n\nA notable shrines are [[Takahashi Inari Shrine]], [[Fujisaki Hachimang\u016b]].\n\nSuizenji Park is also home to the Suizenji Municipal Stadium, where the city's [[football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Roasso Kumamoto]] used to play regularly, but nowadays they use the larger [[KKWing Stadium]] in Higashi Ward.\n\nThe downtown area has a commercial district centred on two shopping arcades, the Shimotori and Kamitori, which extend for several city blocks.

Due to its many innovative defensive designs, Kumamoto Castle was considered impregnable, and Kiyomasa enjoyed a reputation as one of the finest castle-builders in Japanese history. After Kiyomasa died in 1611, his son, Tadahiro, succeeded him. Tadahiro was removed by [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] in 1632, replacing him with the [[Hosokawa clan]].

The ''[[donjon]]'' (castle central keep) is a concrete reconstruction built in the 1970s, but several ancillary wooden buildings remain of the original castle, which was assaulted during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] and sacked and burned after a 53-day [[siege]]. It was during this time that the tradition of eating ''[[Horse meat|basashi]]'' (raw horse meat) originated. ''Basashi'' remains popular in Kumamoto and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in Japan, though these days it is usually considered a delicacy.\n\nWithin the outer walls of Kumamoto Castle is the Hosokawa Gyobu-tei, the former residence of the Higo ''[[daimy\u014d]]''. This traditional wooden mansion has a fine [[Japanese garden]] located on its grounds.\n\n[[Miyamoto Musashi]] lived the last part of his life in Kumamoto. His tomb and the cave where he resided during his final years (known as [[Reigand\u014d]], or \"spirit rock cave\") is situated close by. He penned the famous ''Go Rin no Sho'' (''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'') whilst living here.\n\nKumamoto is also home to [[Suizen-ji J\u014dju-en]], a formal garden neighboring Suizenji Temple approximately 3 kilometers southeast of Kumamoto Castle.\n\nA notable shrines are [[Takahashi Inari Shrine]], [[Fujisaki Hachimang\u016b]].\n\nSuizenji Park is also home to the Suizenji Municipal Stadium, where the city's [[football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Roasso Kumamoto]] used to play regularly, but nowadays they use the larger [[KKWing Stadium]] in Higashi Ward.\n\nThe downtown area has a commercial district centred on two shopping arcades, the Shimotori and Kamitori, which extend for several city blocks.

This was at a time when Cambridge had the lowest proportion of women undergraduates of any university in the [[United Kingdom]], and when only two other colleges ([[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]]) admitted female students.\n\nIn 1962, members of the [[Emma Darwin|Darwin family]] gave their home, \"The Orchard\", to the College. This new site was located on Huntingdon Road, about a mile from the centre of Cambridge. The architects chosen were [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who are known for their design of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] in London, and fundraising commenced. The building work began in 1964 and was completed by [[W. & C. French]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F3124%2FNHAR%202%2F8%2F1|title=New Hall Archives|publisher=Janus| accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> The new college could house up to 300 students.\n\nIn 1967, one of the College's PhD students, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], a researcher in the university [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|radio astronomy group]], discovered the first four [[pulsars]], leading to a [[Nobel Prize]] for her supervisor, and for Jocelyn Bell-Burnell herself, ultimately a position as a Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\nIn 1975, the College's President Dame [[Rosemary Murray]] became the first woman to hold the post of [[Rosemary Murray|Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge]]. Since then, two subsequent presidents, [[Anne Lonsdale]] and [[Jennifer Barnes]], have become Pro-Vice-Chancellors of the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nIn early 2008, Cambridge had decided to change the name of the colleges to Murray Edwards College, leading to protests.<ref name=Murray>{{cite web |last1=Wilce |first1=Hilary |title=Cambridge alumnae protest at plans to rename New Hall college |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/cambridge-alumnae-protest-at-plans-to-rename-new-hall-college-910221.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Curtis |first1=Polly |title=After 50 years as plain old New Hall, Cambridge college gets a \u00a330m donation \u2013 and a new name |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jun/18/highereducation.uk |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 November 2019 |archivedate=17 June 2008}}</ref> There was some opposition to this as the new name of the college incorporates a male surname, despite the college being reserved for women students.<ref name=\"Murray\" />\n\nMen-only Cambridge colleges were converted into mixed-sex colleges in the 1970s and 1980s.

The [[heraldry|Arms]] of the college are emblazoned as follows:\n\n:''Sable a Dolphin palewise head downwards to the dexter in chief three Mullets fesswise a Bordure embattled Argent''\n\nIn plain English, this means: on a black background, place the following features in silver. Vertically in the centre, place a dolphin with head downwards to the left. On top, place three stars horizontally across. Bordering the arms, place a square wave representing the battlements of a castle.\n\nThe black castellation round the arms marks the college's location on [[Castle Hill, Cambridge|Castle Hill]]. The three stars are borrowed from the Murray coat of arms, while the [[Dolphin#Heraldry|heraldic dolphin]] symbolises a youthful spirit of exploration and discovery, and a kindly intelligence.\n\nThe college had designed a new logo to mark its transition from New Hall to Murray Edwards College. It was based on the design of the interior of the dining hall (the \"Dome\") and was called the 'spark'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/giving/refoundation/faq/#9|title=Official site FAQ|publisher=Murray Edwards College'|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115015010/http://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/giving/refoundation/faq/#9|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.murrayedwards.newhall.cam.ac.uk/media/mec-logo.jpg |title= Official Logo Image }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, on consultation with its alumnae, the college decided to continue to use its arms in official materials.\n\n==Buildings==\nLike many of the other Cambridge colleges, Murray Edwards College was not built all at one time but expanded as the need arose, over several time periods. The College therefore has several accommodation blocks of differing styles. In order of construction:\n* Orchard Court (also known as Old Block) recalls the original name of the grounds now occupied by the College, which was formerly known as The Orchard, a large house part-owned by Norah Barlow, granddaughter of [[Charles Darwin]]. It is divided into the Wolfson, Nuffield and Spooner Wings, named after donors to the College during its first few decades.

This was at a time when Cambridge had the lowest proportion of women undergraduates of any university in the [[United Kingdom]], and when only two other colleges ([[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]]) admitted female students.\n\nIn 1962, members of the [[Emma Darwin|Darwin family]] gave their home, \"The Orchard\", to the College. This new site was located on Huntingdon Road, about a mile from the centre of Cambridge. The architects chosen were [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who are known for their design of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] in London, and fundraising commenced. The building work began in 1964 and was completed by [[W. & C. French]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F3124%2FNHAR%202%2F8%2F1|title=New Hall Archives|publisher=Janus| accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> The new college could house up to 300 students.\n\nIn 1967, one of the College's PhD students, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], a researcher in the university [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|radio astronomy group]], discovered the first four [[pulsars]], leading to a [[Nobel Prize]] for her supervisor, and for Jocelyn Bell-Burnell herself, ultimately a position as a Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\nIn 1975, the College's President Dame [[Rosemary Murray]] became the first woman to hold the post of [[Rosemary Murray|Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge]]. Since then, two subsequent presidents, [[Anne Lonsdale]] and [[Jennifer Barnes]], have become Pro-Vice-Chancellors of the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nIn early 2008, Cambridge had decided to change the name of one of the women's colleges to Murray Edwards College, leading to protests.<ref name=Murray>{{cite web |last1=Wilce |first1=Hilary |title=Cambridge alumnae protest at plans to rename New Hall college |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/cambridge-alumnae-protest-at-plans-to-rename-new-hall-college-910221.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Curtis |first1=Polly |title=After 50 years as plain old New Hall, Cambridge college gets a \u00a330m donation \u2013 and a new name |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jun/18/highereducation.uk |website=The Guardian |accessdate=13 November 2019 |archivedate=17 June 2008}}</ref> The main opposition is having a male name in a female college.<ref name=\"Murray\" />\n\nMen-only Cambridge colleges were converted into mixed-sex colleges in the 1970s and 1980s.

The [[heraldry|Arms]] of the college are emblazoned as follows:\n\n:''Sable a Dolphin palewise head downwards to the dexter in chief three Mullets fesswise a Bordure embattled Argent''\n\nIn plain English, this means: on a black background, place the following features in silver. Vertically in the centre, place a dolphin with head downwards to the left. On top, place three stars horizontally across. Bordering the arms, place a square wave representing the battlements of a castle.\n\nThe black castellation round the arms marks the college's location on [[Castle Hill, Cambridge|Castle Hill]]. The three stars are borrowed from the Murray coat of arms, while the [[Dolphin#Heraldry|heraldic dolphin]] symbolises a youthful spirit of exploration and discovery, and a kindly intelligence.\n\nThe college had designed a new logo to mark its transition from New Hall to Murray Edwards College. It was based on the design of the interior of the dining hall (the \"Dome\") and was called the 'spark'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/giving/refoundation/faq/#9|title=Official site FAQ|publisher=Murray Edwards College'|accessdate=14 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115015010/http://www.murrayedwards.cam.ac.uk/giving/refoundation/faq/#9|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.murrayedwards.newhall.cam.ac.uk/media/mec-logo.jpg |title= Official Logo Image }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, on consultation with its alumnae, the college decided to continue to use its arms in official materials.\n\n==Buildings==\nLike many of the other Cambridge colleges, Murray Edwards College was not built all at one time but expanded as the need arose, over several time periods. The College therefore has several accommodation blocks of differing styles. In order of construction:\n* Orchard Court (also known as Old Block) recalls the original name of the grounds now occupied by the College, which was formerly known as The Orchard, a large house part-owned by Norah Barlow, granddaughter of [[Charles Darwin]].

It has been populated since prehistoric times. {{As of|2019|12|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 690,881 in 106,087 households,<ref name=\"Shizuoka City\">[http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000_001588_00001.html Shizuoka City official statistics]{{in lang|ja}}</ref> and a [[population density]] of 489 persons per km\u00b2.\n\nThe city's name is made up of two ''[[kanji]]'', \u9759 ''shizu'', meaning \"still\" or \"calm\"; and \u5ca1 ''oka'', meaning \"hill(s)\".<ref name=\"PlacenamesOfTheWorld\" /> In 1869, Shizuoka Domain was first created out of the older [[Sunpu Domain]], and that name was retained when the city was incorporated in 1885. In 2003, Shizuoka absorbed neighboring Shimizu City (now [[Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka|Shimizu Ward]]) to create the new and expanded city of Shizuoka, briefly becoming the largest city by land area in Japan. In 2005, it became one of Japan's \"[[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated cities]]\".\n\n==Geography==\nShizuoka City lies in central [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], about halfway between [[Tokyo]] and [[Nagoya]] along the [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt|T\u014dkaid\u014d Corridor]], between [[Suruga Bay]] to the south and the [[Akaishi Mountains|Minami Alps]] in the north. Shizuoka had the largest area of any municipality in Japan after merging with Shimizu City in April 2003, until February 2005, when [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] superseded it by merging with nine surrounding municipalities.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Shizuoka 2008-01-02.jpg|Shizuoka City seen from the South\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:City Hall of Shizuoka.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Shizuoka City Hall]]\nThe total area of the city is {{convert|1411.90|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=2015stats>http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000163754.pdf</ref> Shizuoka is the 5th largest city in Japan in terms of geographic area after Takayama, [[Hamamatsu]], [[Nikk\u014d, Tochigi|Nikk\u014d]], and [[Kitami, Hokkaido|Kitami]].

Numerous [[kofun]] have been found within the city limits, and the [[Toro (archaeological site)|Toro]] [[archaeological site]] indicates that a major [[Yayoi period]] (circa 400 BC\u2013300 AD) settlement existed in what is now part of the central city area.\n\n[[Suruga province|Suruga]] was established as a province of Japan in the early [[Nara period]]. At some point between the year 701 and 710, the provincial capital was relocated from what is now [[Numazu, Shizuoka|Numazu]], to a more central location on the banks of the [[Abe River]] at a location named {{nihongo|Sunpu|\u99ff\u5e9c}} (a contraction of {{nihongo|\"Suruga no Kokufu\"|\u99ff\u6cb3\u306e\u56fd\u5e9c}}) or alternatively {{nihongo|\"Fuch\u016b\"|\u5e9c\u4e2d}}.\n\n=== Pre-modern Shizuoka ===\nDuring the [[Muromachi period]], Sunpu was the capital of the [[Imagawa clan]]. The Imagawa were defeated at the [[Battle of Okehazama]], and Sunpu was subsequently ruled by [[Takeda Shingen]], followed by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. However, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] relocated Ieyasu, and installed Nakamura Kazutada to rule Sunpu. After the Toyotomi were defeated in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Ieyasu recovered Sunpu, reassigning it to his own retainer, [[Nait\u014d Nobunari]] in 1601. This marked the start of [[Sunpu Domain]].\n\n[[File:Toro3.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed building at the Toro archeological site]]\n\nIn April 1606, Ieyasu officially retired from the post of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'', and retired to Sunpu, where he established a secondary court, from which he could influence ''Sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] from behind the scenes. Subsequently, aside for brief periods, Sunpu was ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|tenry\u014d]]'' (territory under direct administration by the Shogunate), ruled by the {{nihongo|''[[Sunpu j\u014ddai]]''|\u99ff\u5e9c\u57ce\u4ee3|}}, an appointed official based in Sunpu.\n\n[[File:Sunpu castle tatsumiyagura.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstructed Tatsumi [[Yagura (tower)|yagura]] of [[Sunpu Castle]] ]]\n\n===From the Meiji period to World War II===\nIn 1869, after the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the former shogunal line, headed by [[Tokugawa Iesato]] was sent to Sunpu and assigned the short-lived [[Sunpu Domain]]. The same year, Sunpu was renamed \"Shizuoka\". Shizuoka Domain became [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] with the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871, which was expanded in 1876 through merger with the former [[Hamamatsu Prefecture]] and western portions of [[Ashigaru Prefecture]] in 1876. [[Shizuoka Station]] on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] was opened on 1 February 1889. The same day, a fire burned down most of downtown Shizuoka.\n\nThe modern city was founded on 1 April 1889. At the time, the population was 37,681, and Shizuoka was one of the first 31 cities established in Japan.\n\nAn electric [[tram]] service began in 1911. In 1914, due to heavy rains caused by a [[typhoon]], the [[Abe River]] flooded, inundating the downtown area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsece.or.jp/publish/277/4.html|title=The landslide dam and outburst floods at Warabino area of the Abe River in 1914|last=Inoue|first=Kimio|work=Journal of the Japan Society of Erosion Control Engineering, Vol.61,No.2,2008|publisher=Japan Society of Erosion Control Engineering|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n. In the national census of 1920, the population of Shizuoka was 74,093. The area of the city continued to expand through the 1920s and 1930s through merger with outlying towns and villages. In 1935, the city was struck by a 6.4 magnitude [[earthquake]], resulting in much damage. Although soon rebuilt, a large fire in 1940 again destroyed much of the center of the city.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Shizuoka lacked targets of major military significance, and was initially only lightly bombed during several [[Japan campaign|American air raids]]. However, in a major [[firebombing]] [[Bombing of Shizuoka in World War II|raid of 19 June 1945]], the city suffered an extreme amount of damage with high civilian casualties.\n\n===Post-war Shizuoka===\nThe area of the city continued to expand through the 1950s and 1960s through merger with outlying towns and villages. On 1 October 1964, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] began services to Shizuoka, and on 25 April 1969 the city was connected to the [[T\u014dmei Expressway]]. On 7 July 1974, the Abe River flooded, and landslides occurred during heavy rains, killing 23 people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\nOn 16 August 1980, a major gas leak in an underground shopping center near Shizuoka Station resulted in an explosion, killing 15 people and seriously injuring 233 others.

The Port of Shimizu has a water depth of about 12 meters; its attractiveness has been enhanced over the past years by the construction of new road and rail links which contribute to expanding its commercial hinterland.\n\nIn tonnage, imports (about 6.5 million tons) are close to twice export volumes, but in trade value exports are twice as valuable as imports.\n\nThe Port of Shimizu container traffic is about balanced, with over 250,000 TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit) in each direction, with auto parts and chemicals amongst the main cargo types. Major international container lines provide weekly services on major trade routes, including North America, Europe and Asia, with about 110 calls per months on 28 trade routes.\n\nThe port of Shimizu also includes a terminal to receive [[LNG]] tankers and store imported Liquefied natural gas; it is operated by Shimizu LNG, a subsidiary of Shizuoka Gas (Japan is the world's largest importer of [[LNG]]).\n\nThe Port of Shimizu is also connected to other Japan ports. In particular, it is served by a Roll-on/roll-off service serving the port of [[\u014cita Prefecture|\u014cita]], on the north-east coast of the southern island of [[Kyushu]]. This service, which sails three times a week and has a transit time of 20 hours, has enabled a modal shift of freight trucks from road to sea, thereby contributing to decreasing congestion and pollution on roads.\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe nearest airport is [[Shizuoka Airport]], situated between [[Makinohara, Shizuoka|Makinohara]] and [[Shimada, Shizuoka|Shimada]].\n\n==Education==\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n[[File:Shizuoka University.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Shizuoka University|The main campus of [[Shizuoka University]] ]]\n;[[Shizuoka University]]\n:[[Japanese national university|National university]], founded 1949.

is the capital city of [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], [[Japan]], and the prefecture's second-largest city in both population and area. It has been populated since prehistoric times. {{As of|2019|12|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 690,881 in 106,087 households,<ref name=\"Shizuoka City\">[http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000_001588_00001.html Shizuoka City official statistics]{{in lang|ja}}</ref> and a [[population density]] of 489 persons per km\u00b2.\n\nThe city's name is made up of two ''[[kanji]]'', \u9759 ''shizu'', meaning \"still\" or \"calm\"; and \u5ca1 ''oka'', meaning \"hill(s)\".<ref name=\"PlacenamesOfTheWorld\" /> In 1869, Shizuoka Domain was first created out of the older [[Sunpu Domain]], and that name was retained when the city was incorporated in 1885. In 2003, Shizuoka absorbed neighboring Shimizu City (now [[Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka|Shimizu Ward]]) to create the new and expanded city of Shizuoka, briefly becoming the largest city by land area in Japan. In 2005, it became one of Japan's \"[[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated cities]]\".\n\n==Geography==\nShizuoka City lies in central [[Shizuoka Prefecture]], about halfway between [[Tokyo]] and [[Nagoya]] along the [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt|T\u014dkaid\u014d Corridor]], between [[Suruga Bay]] to the south and the [[Akaishi Mountains|Minami Alps]] in the north. Shizuoka had the largest area of any municipality in Japan after merging with Shimizu City in April 2003, until February 2005, when [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]] superseded it by merging with nine surrounding municipalities.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Shizuoka 2008-01-02.jpg|Shizuoka City seen from the South\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:City Hall of Shizuoka.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Shizuoka City Hall]]\nThe total area of the city is {{convert|1411.90|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=2015stats>http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/000163754.pdf</ref> Shizuoka is the 5th largest city in Japan in terms of geographic area after Takayama, [[Hamamatsu]], [[Nikk\u014d, Tochigi|Nikk\u014d]], and [[Kitami, Hokkaido|Kitami]]. It is also the 2nd largest city in Shizuoka Prefecture in terms of both geographic area and population after [[Hamamatsu]], but ranks higher as an [[Urban Employment Area]],<ref name=\"UEACodeTable\" /> and leads as a [[metropolitan area]] and business region.\n\nThe fan-like shape of the Shizuoka Plain and Miho Peninsula were formed over the ages by the fast-flowing [[Abe River]], carrying along collapsed sand and earth. These areas form the foundations of the city today.<ref name=\"APWS242\" /> The isolated [[Mount Kun\u014d]] separates the Suruga coastline from the Shimizu coastline.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n=== Basic data ===\n* Area of densely populated region: 103.99&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n* Urban planning area: 234.80&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n* Area zoned for urbanization: 104.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n\n===Bordering municipalities===\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Shizuoka Prefecture]]\n** [[Fuji, Shizuoka|Fuji]]\n** [[Fujieda, Shizuoka|Fujieda]]\n** [[Yaizu, Shizuoka|Yaizu]]\n** [[Shimada, Shizuoka|Shimada]]\n** [[Fujinomiya, Shizuoka|Fujinomiya]]\n** [[Haibara District, Shizuoka|Haibara District]]\n** [[Kawanehon]]\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n*[[Yamanashi Prefecture]]\n** [[Minami-Alps, Yamanashi|Minami-Alps]]\n** [[Hayakawa, Yamanashi|Hayakawa]] ([[Minamikoma District, Yamanashi|Minamikoma District]])\n** [[Minobu, Yamanashi|Minobu]] ([[Minamikoma District, Yamanashi|Minamikoma District]])\n** [[Nanbu, Yamanashi|Nanbu]] ([[Minamikoma District, Yamanashi|Minamikoma District]])\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n*[[Nagano Prefecture]]\n** [[Iida, Nagano|Iida]]\n** [[Ina, Nagano|Ina]]\n** [[\u014cshika, Nagano|\u014cshika]] ([[Shimoina District, Nagano|Shimoina District]])\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Climate===\nOn the south-central Pacific coast Shizuoka has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), which is hot and humid in the summers and rarely snows in winter.<ref>[http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/monthly_s3_en.php?block_no=47656&view=14 Snow depth for Shizuoka]</ref> It is close to the warm [[Kuroshio Current]] and is wet even by Japanese standards with only slightly less precipitation than [[Kanazawa]] on the opposite side of Honsh\u016b, but it is paradoxically the sunniest of Japan's major cities owing to the absence of summer fog and its sheltered location from the northwesterly winds off the [[Sea of Japan]].

Numerous [[kofun]] have been found within the city limits, and the [[Toro (archaeological site)|Toro]] [[archaeological site]] indicates that a major [[Yayoi period]] (circa 400 BC\u2013300 AD) settlement existed in what is now part of the central city area.\n\n[[Suruga province|Suruga]] was established as a province of Japan in the early [[Nara period]]. At some point between the year 701 and 710, the provincial capital was relocated from what is now [[Numazu, Shizuoka|Numazu]], to a more central location on the banks of the [[Abe River]] at a location named {{nihongo|Sunpu|\u99ff\u5e9c}} (a contraction of {{nihongo|\"Suruga no Kokufu\"|\u99ff\u6cb3\u306e\u56fd\u5e9c}}) or alternatively {{nihongo|\"Fuch\u016b\"|\u5e9c\u4e2d}}.\n\n=== Pre-modern Shizuoka ===\nDuring the [[Muromachi period]], Sunpu was the capital of the [[Imagawa clan]]. The Imagawa were defeated at the [[Battle of Okehazama]], and Sunpu was subsequently ruled by [[Takeda Shingen]], followed by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. However, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] relocated Ieyasu, and installed Nakamura Kazutada to rule Sunpu. After the Toyotomi were defeated in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], Ieyasu recovered Sunpu, reassigning it to his own retainer, [[Nait\u014d Nobunari]] in 1601. This marked the start of [[Sunpu Domain]].\n\n[[File:Toro3.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed building at the Toro archeological site]]\n\nIn April 1606, Ieyasu officially retired from the post of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'', and retired to Sunpu, where he established a secondary court, from which he could influence ''Sh\u014dgun'' [[Tokugawa Hidetada]] from behind the scenes. Subsequently, aside for brief periods, Sunpu was ''[[Tokugawa shogunate|tenry\u014d]]'' (territory under direct administration by the Shogunate), ruled by the {{nihongo|''[[Sunpu j\u014ddai]]''|\u99ff\u5e9c\u57ce\u4ee3|}}, an appointed official based in Sunpu.\n\n[[File:Sunpu castle tatsumiyagura.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstructed Tatsumi [[Yagura (tower)|yagura]] of [[Sunpu Castle]] ]]\n\n===From the Meiji period to World War II===\nIn 1869, after the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the former shogunal line, headed by [[Tokugawa Iesato]] was sent to Sunpu and assigned the short-lived [[Sunpu Domain]]. The same year, Sunpu was renamed \"Shizuoka\". Shizuoka Domain became [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] with the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871, which was expanded in 1876 through merger with the former [[Hamamatsu Prefecture]] and western portions of [[Ashigaru Prefecture]] in 1876. [[Shizuoka Station]] on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] was opened on 1 February 1889. The same day, a fire burned down most of downtown Shizuoka.\n\nThe modern city was founded on 1 April 1889. At the time, the population was 37,681, and Shizuoka was one of the first 31 cities established in Japan.\n\nAn electric [[tram]] service began in 1911. In 1914, due to heavy rains caused by a [[typhoon]], the [[Abe River]] flooded, inundating the downtown area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsece.or.jp/publish/277/4.html|title=The landslide dam and outburst floods at Warabino area of the Abe River in 1914|last=Inoue|first=Kimio|work=Journal of the Japan Society of Erosion Control Engineering, Vol.61,No.2,2008|publisher=Japan Society of Erosion Control Engineering|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref>\n. In the national census of 1920, the population of Shizuoka was 74,093. The area of the city continued to expand through the 1920s and 1930s through merger with outlying towns and villages. In 1935, the city was struck by a 6.4 magnitude [[earthquake]], resulting in much damage. Although soon rebuilt, a large fire in 1940 again destroyed much of the center of the city.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Shizuoka lacked targets of major military significance, and was initially only lightly bombed during several [[Japan campaign|American air raids]]. However, in a major [[firebombing]] [[Bombing of Shizuoka in World War II|raid of 19 June 1945]], the city suffered an extreme amount of damage with high civilian casualties.\n\n===Post-war Shizuoka===\nThe area of the city continued to expand through the 1950s and 1960s through merger with outlying towns and villages. On 1 October 1964, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] began services to Shizuoka, and on 25 April 1969 the city was connected to the [[T\u014dmei Expressway]]. On 7 July 1974, the Abe River flooded, and landslides occurred during heavy rains, killing 23 people.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\nOn 16 August 1980, a major gas leak in an underground shopping center near Shizuoka Station resulted in an explosion, killing 15 people and seriously injuring 233 others.

On 1 April 1992, Shizuoka was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] by the central government, giving it increased autonomy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130629153438/http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000215647.pdf] List of Core Cities, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications</ref>\n\nThe 1 April 2003 [[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|merger]] with Shimizu City (current [[Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka|Shimizu Ward]]) greatly expanded the area and population of Shizuoka,<ref>[http://www.city.shizuoka.jp.e.qv.hp.transer.com/556_000097.html Shizuoka city home page, Shimizu merger documents]</ref> which then became a [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated city]] on 1 April 2005,<ref name=\"DecodingBoundaries148\" /> and was divided into three wards. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nDespite being somewhat geographically isolated from the rest of the city, the town of [[Kanbara, Shizuoka|Kanbara]] (from [[Haibara District, Shizuoka|Haibara District]]) was merged into Shizuoka on 31 March 2006,<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20060411f1.html City mergers seen tailing off as the initial excitement fades | The Japan Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> becoming part of Shimizu Ward.

Dried, ground fish (sardine, mackerel, or ''[[katsuobushi]]'') and ''[[aonori]]'' powder (edible seaweed) are sprinkled on top before eating.\n:\n;[[Gyoza]]\n:\n;[[Soba]] noodles\n:\n;[[Seafood]]\n:\n;[[Z\u014dni]] soup\n:[[Mochi|rice cakes]] in a broth cooked with vegetables, popular at New Year\n;[[Dioscorea polystachya|''Tororo'']]\n:A grated yam soup.

Probably the biggest event on Shizuoka's Calendar, it is an annual international busker's festival, held in November. It includes various shows such as juggling, pantomime, magic, etc. Performers come from around the world and perform throughout the central part of the city as well as in some peripheral locations. From 2005, it expanded from a 3-day to a 4-day festival.\n\n===Sport===\nWith the Shimizu merger, [[Shimizu S-Pulse]] became the major [[football (soccer)|soccer]] club in the city. Recently, however, a new rival club, [[Fujieda MYFC]] (From nearby [[Fujieda, Shizuoka|Fujieda]]), has been rising in the regional league ranks as a contender for a place in the [[Japan Football League]].\nThe city hosted the official [[Asian Basketball Championship for Women]] in [[1995 Asian Basketball Championship for Women|1995]] and [[1999 Asian Basketball Championship for Women|1999]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Shizuoka Station (North exit).jpg|thumb|[[Shizuoka Station]] North exit ]]\n\n===Railway===\nShizuoka lies on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]], the [[JR Central]] main railway line from Tokyo to Osaka, and is well-served by the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]], limited express and regional trains. The central station of Shizuoka is in the city centre. Shizuoka also has an [[Light rail|LRT]] line, the [[Shizuoka Railway Shizuoka-Shimizu Line|Shizuoka Railway]], administered by the [[Shizuoka Railway]] Co., Ltd. at [[Shizuoka Station]]. The under construction [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]] will pass through the mountainous area in the northern tip of the city. However, the line is not planned to have a station in Shizuoka.\n*[[File:JR logo (central).svg|20px]] [[Central Japan Railway Company]] - [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]\n**{{STN|Shizuoka}}\n*[[File:JR logo (central).svg|20px]] [[Central Japan Railway Company]] - [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]]\n**{{STN|Shin-Kambara}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Kambara}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Yui}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Okitsu}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Shimizu|Shizuoka}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Kusanagi|JR Central}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Higashi-Shizuoka}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Shizuoka}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Abekawa}}{{\u2022}}{{STN|Mochimune}}{{\u2022}}\n* [[File:Shizuoka Railway logo.jpg|15px]] [[Shizuoka Railway]] \u2013 [[Shizuoka Railway Shizuoka-Shimizu Line]]\n** {{STN|Shin-Shizuoka}} \u2013 {{STN|Hiyoshich\u014d}} \u2013 {{STN|Otowach\u014d}} \u2013 {{STN|Kasugach\u014d}} \u2013 {{STN|Yunoki|Shizuoka, Shizuoka}} \u2013 {{STN|Naganuma|Shizuoka}} \u2013 {{STN|Furush\u014d}} \u2013 {{STN|Ken-S\u014dg\u014d Und\u014dj\u014d}} \u2013 {{STN|Kenritsu Bijutsukanmae}} \u2013 {{STN|Kusanagi|Shizuoka Railway}} \u2013 {{STN|Mikadodai}} \u2013 {{STN|Kitsunegasaki}} \u2013 {{STN|Sakurabashi|Shizuoka}} \u2013 {{STN|Irieoka}} \u2013 {{STN|Shin-Shimizu}}\n* [[File:Daitetsu logomark.svg|15px]] [[\u014cigawa Railway]] \u2013 [[\u014cigawa Railway Ikawa Line]]\n** {{STN|Kanz\u014d}} \u2013 {{STN|Ikawa}}\n\n===Highways===\n* [[Image:E1 Expressway (Japan).png|24px|link=|alt=E1]] [[T\u014dmei Expressway]]\n* [[Image:E1A Expressway (Japan).png|24px|link=|alt=E1A]] [[Shin-T\u014dmei Expressway]]\n* [[Image:E52 Expressway (Japan).png|24px|link=|alt=E52]] [[Ch\u016bbu-\u014cdan Expressway]]\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|1}}\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|52}}\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|149}}\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|150}}\n*{{jct|country=JPN|Route|362}}\n\n===Sea port===\n\nThe Port of Shimizu-ku, in Shimizu City (now [[Shimizu Ward]]), is a long established mid-size sea port, catering to container ships, dry bulk ships and cruise ships ( https://www.portofshimizu-intl.com/ ).\n\nIt is well located, being in between the two major port areas of Japan, i.e. the [[Tokyo Bay]] ports of Tokyo, Kawasaki and Yokohama ([[Keihin region|Keihin]] ports) and the [[Osaka Bay]] ports of Osaka and Kobe ([[Hanshin Industrial Region|Hanshin]] ports). The Port of Shimizu has a water depth of about 12 meters; its attractiveness has been enhanced over the past years by the construction of new road and rail links which contribute to expanding its commercial hinterland.\n\nIn tonnage, imports (about 6.5 million tons) are close to twice export volumes, but in trade value exports are twice as valuable as imports.\n\nThe Port of Shimizu container traffic is about balanced, with over 250,000 TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit) in each direction, with auto parts and chemicals amongst the main cargo types. Major international container lines provide weekly services on major trade routes, including North America, Europe and Asia, with about 110 calls per months on 28 trade routes.\n\nThe port of Shimizu also includes a terminal to receive [[LNG]] tankers and store imported Liquefied natural gas; it is operated by Shimizu LNG, a subsidiary of Shizuoka Gas (Japan is the world's largest importer of [[LNG]]).\n\nThe Port of Shimizu is also connected to other Japan ports. In particular, it is served by a Roll-on/roll-off service serving the port of [[\u014cita Prefecture|\u014cita]], on the north-east coast of the southern island of [[Kyushu]]. This service, which sails three times a week and has a transit time of 20 hours, has enabled a modal shift of freight trucks from road to sea, thereby contributing to decreasing congestion and pollution on roads.\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe nearest airport is [[Shizuoka Airport]], situated between [[Makinohara, Shizuoka|Makinohara]] and [[Shimada, Shizuoka|Shimada]].\n\n==Education==\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n[[File:Shizuoka University.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Shizuoka University|The main campus of [[Shizuoka University]] ]]\n;[[Shizuoka University]]\n:[[Japanese national university|National university]], founded 1949.
