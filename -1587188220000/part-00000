Each virtual machine can execute its own [[operating system]], including versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BSD]], and [[MS-DOS]]. VMware Workstation is developed and sold by [[VMware, Inc.]], a division of [[Dell Technologies]]. There is a free-of-charge version, VMware Workstation Player, for non-commercial use. An operating systems license is needed to use proprietary ones such as Windows. Ready-made Linux VMs set up for different purposes are available from several sources.\n\nVMware Workstation supports [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] existing host [[network adapter]]s and sharing physical [[disk drive]]s and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] devices with a virtual machine. It can simulate disk drives; an [[ISO image]] file can be [[mount (computing)|mounted]] as a virtual [[optical disc drive]], and virtual [[hard disk drive]]s are implemented as [[.vmdk]] files.\n\nVMware Workstation Pro can save the state of a virtual machine (a \"snapshot\") at any instant. These snapshots can later be restored, effectively returning the virtual machine to the saved state,<ref>{{cite web |last=Warren |first=Steven |url=http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/virtualization-coach/?p=143 |title=Snapshots in VMware Workstation |publisher=Blogs.techrepublic.com.com |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2012-09-13 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707022902/http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/virtualization-coach/?p=143 |archive-date=2012-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as it was and free from any post-snapshot damage to the VM.\n\nVMware Workstation includes the ability to group multiple virtual machines in an inventory folder. The machines in such a folder can then be powered on and powered off as a single object, useful for testing complex client-server environments.\n\n==2016 company changes and future development==\nVMware Workstation versions 12.0.0, 12.0.1, and 12.1.0 were released at intervals of about two months in 2015.<ref name=download>{{cite web |url=https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0 |title=Download VMware Workstation Player|website=VMware |date= |author=<!--not stated--> |accessdate= 11 May 2016}} Download site for VMware Player 7.x and Workstation Player 12.x</ref> In January 2016 the entire development team behind VMware Workstation and Fusion was disbanded and all US developers were immediately fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ir.vmware.com/default.aspx?SectionId=5cc5ecae-6c48-4521-a1ad-480e593e4835&LanguageId=1&PressReleaseId=e2fb62b8-b4a0-4a64-853b-bce3b3b51948 |title=VMware Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Results |website=ir.vmware.com |date=26 January 2016 |author=<!--not stated--> |accessdate= 13 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = VMware axes Fusion and Workstation US devs|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/01/27/vmware_fusion_and_workstation_development_team_fired/|access-date = 2016-01-28|last = Cloud|last2 = Security|last3 = Australia|last4 = Vmware|last5 = Microsoft|first6 = VMware axes Fusion and Workstation US|last6 = devs|first7 = new multi-cloud plan will ensure growth|last7 = VMware says vSphere in decline|first8 = vows to focus on 'core products'|last8 = Citrix kills Sydney research lab}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = VMware Confirms Layoffs In Earnings Statement As It Prepares For Dell Acquisition|url = https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/vmware-confirms-layoffs-in-earnings-statement-as-it-prepares-for-dell-acquisition/|website = TechCrunch|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = Ron|last = Miller}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = A Tribute to VMware Workstation, Fusion, and Hosted UI|url = http://blog.chipx86.com/2016/01/26/a-tribute-to-vmware-workstation-fusion-and-hosted-ui/|website = ChipLog|access-date = 2016-01-28|last = chipx86}}</ref> The company said that \"the restructuring activities will not impact the existence of any current product lines\", that \"roles and responsibilities associated with particular businesses will be moved to other regions and office locations\", and that investment would continue \"with emphasis on our growth products\".

Each virtual machine can execute its own [[operating system]], including versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BSD]], and [[MS-DOS]]. VMware Workstation is developed and sold by [[VMware, Inc.]], a division of [[Dell Technologies]]. There is a free-of-charge version, VMware Workstation Player, for non-commercial use. An operating systems license is needed to use proprietary ones such as Windows. Ready-made Linux VMs set up for different purposes are available from several sources.\n\nVMware Workstation supports [[bridging (networking)|bridging]] existing host [[network adapter]]s and sharing physical [[disk drive]]s and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] devices with a virtual machine. It can simulate disk drives; an [[ISO image]] file can be [[mount (computing)|mounted]] as a virtual [[optical disc drive]], and virtual [[hard disk drive]]s are implemented as [[.vmdk]] files.\n\nVMware Workstation Pro can save the state of a virtual machine (a \"snapshot\") at any instant.

In 1953, he co-authored with [[Francis Crick]] the academic paper proposing the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix structure]] of the [[DNA]] [[molecule]]. Watson, Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were awarded the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of [[nucleic acid]]s and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nWatson earned degrees at the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1947) and [[Indiana University]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with [[Herman Kalckar]] and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the [[Harvard University]] Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. \n\nFrom 1968 Watson served as director of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of [[cancer]], along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between [[intelligence and race]]. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated his views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.\n\nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook ''Molecular Biology of the Gene'' (1965) and his bestselling book ''[[The Double Helix]]'' (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the [[National Institutes of Health]], helping to establish the [[Human Genome Project]], which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.\n\n<br />\n<!-- PER WP:LEADCITE, MATERIAL FOUND HERE IS CITED IN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE -->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJames D.

In 1953, he co-authored with [[Francis Crick]] the academic paper proposing the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix structure]] of the [[DNA]] [[molecule]]. Watson, Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were awarded the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of [[nucleic acid]]s and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nWatson earned degrees at the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1947) and [[Indiana University]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with [[Herman Kalckar]] and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the [[Harvard University]] Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. \n\nFrom 1968 Watson served as director of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of [[cancer]], along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between [[intelligence and race]]. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated his views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.\n\nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook ''Molecular Biology of the Gene'' (1965) and his bestselling book ''[[The Double Helix]]'' (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the [[National Institutes of Health]], helping to establish the [[Human Genome Project]], which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.\n\n<br />\n<!-- PER WP:LEADCITE, MATERIAL FOUND HERE IS CITED IN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE -->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJames D.

One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that ''The Lancet'' published Watson's paper only because of his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/dna-pioneer-james-watson-theory-diseases|title=DNA pioneer James Watson sets out radical theory for range of diseases|author=Ian Sample|work=the Guardian|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Molenaar|first1=RJ|last2=van Noorden|first2=CJ|title=Type 2 diabetes and cancer as redox diseases?|journal=Lancet|date=September 6, 2014|volume=384|issue=9946|page=853|pmid=25209484|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61485-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel prize medal to raise money;<ref>{{cite news |last=Crow |first=David |title=James Watson to sell Nobel Prize medal |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5fb47ebe-75bc-11e4-a1a9-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=December 1, 2014 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=November 28, 2014 |quote='Because I was an \"unperson\" I was fired from the boards of companies, so I have no income, apart from my academic income,' he said.}}</ref> part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research.<ref>{{cite web |title=DNA pioneer James Watson to sell Nobel Prize |last=Jones |first=Bryony |date=November 26, 2014 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/25/world/james-watson-to-sell-nobel-prize/ |website=CNN International World News |publisher=CNN |accessdate=November 30, 2014 |quote=Watson says he intends to use part of the money raised by the sale to fund projects at the universities and scientific research institutions he has worked at throughout his career.}}</ref> The medal sold at auction at [[Christie's]] in December 2014 for {{USD|4.1 million}}.
