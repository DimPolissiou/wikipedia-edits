Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known.

Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known. Lau tells Bardon Schaeffer, Black Tusk's leader in Washington D.C., that Keener's rogue agent network will help them end the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent, but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso informs the Agent of a rogue agent cell activated in Washington D.C..\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by [[Massive Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/|title=The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=March 8, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Evaluating the feedback from players regarding the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]], Massive Entertainment planned to include more game content at launch and improve the endgame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-on-how-the-division-2-will-be-better-than-/1100-6459041/|title=Ubisoft On How The Division 2 Will Be Better Than The Division 1|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The game's endgame development was prioritized by Massive Entertainment after hearing players' complaints from the first game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-division-2s-developer-says-first-games-post-launch-response-was-a-nightmare|title=E3 2018: The Division 2's Developer Says First Game's Post-launch Response Was A Nightmare|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The developers have said that the game's main campaign will take around 40 hours to beat, making it twice as long as the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/wk543/the-division-2-how-long-is-the-campaign|title=The Division 2: How Long is the Campaign?|first=William|last=Parks|work=[[GameSkinny]]|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was announced on March 9, 2018, by Ubisoft, with the first gameplay footage being premiered at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] in June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-2-will-release-within-a-year-ubisoft-confirms/|title=The Division 2 will release within the next 12 months, Ubisoft confirms|first=Samuel|last=Horti|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed that the game will be released on March 15, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/ | title = The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018 | first=  Stephany | last = Nunnelly | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = March 8, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> A [[Software release life cycle#Beta|private beta]] was launched prior to the game's release.

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June

It is a requirement for marriage within the Amish church. Once a person is baptized within the church, he or she may marry only within the faith.  Church districts have between 20 and 40 families and worship services are held every other Sunday in a member's home. The district is led by a bishop and several ministers and deacons.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 1994 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=OYNYKYsulbQC&pg=PA3 3]}}  The rules of the church, the ''[[Ordnung]]'', must be observed by every member and cover many aspects of day-to-day living, including prohibitions or limitations on the use of power-line electricity, telephones, and automobiles, as well as regulations on clothing.  Most Amish do not buy commercial insurance or participate in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].  As [[Anabaptist#Today|present-day Anabaptists]], Amish church members practice [[nonresistance]] and will not perform any type of military service. The Amish value rural life, manual labor, and humility, all under the auspices of living what they interpret to be God's word.\n\nMembers who do not conform to these community expectations and who cannot be convinced to [[repentance|repent]] are excommunicated.

In [[Z\u00fcrich]] on January 21, 1525, [[Conrad Grebel]] and [[George Blaurock]] practiced adult baptism to each other and then to others.<ref>Anthony L. Chute, Nathan A. Finn, Michael A.&nbsp;G.

The first informal division between Swiss Brethren was recorded in the 17th century between {{lang|pdc|Oberl\u00e4nder}}s ([[Bernese Highlands|those living in the hills]]) and {{lang|pdc|Emmentaler}} (those living in the [[Emmental]] valley). The {{lang|pdc|Oberl\u00e4nder}}s were a more extreme congregation; their zeal pushed them into more remote areas and their solitude made them more zealous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSwiss Anabaptism developed, from this point, in two parallel streams, most clearly marked by disagreement over the preferred treatment of \"fallen\" believers. The Emmentalers (sometimes referred to as Reistians, after bishop [[Hans Reist]], a leader among the Emmentalers) argued that fallen believers should only be withheld from [[Holy Communion|communion]], and not regular meals.  The Amish argued that those who had been banned should be avoided even in common meals.  The Reistian side eventually formed the basis of the [[Swiss Mennonite Conference]]. Because of this common heritage, Amish and Mennonites from southern Germany and Switzerland retain many similarities. Those who leave the Amish fold tend to join various congregations of [[Conservative Mennonites]].{{Sfn | Smith | Krahn | 1981 | pp = 212\u201314}}{{Sfn | Kraybill| 2000| pp = 63\u201364}}\n\n=== Migration to North America ===\nAmish began migrating to Pennsylvania, then known for its [[religious toleration]], in 1727<ref>[https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/here-are-takeaways-from-our-conversation-with-don-kraybill-on/article_6cc6a48a-8461-11e8-8418-23f57668ebfe.html 6 takeaways from our conversation with Don Kraybill] at lancasteronline.com.</ref>  as part of a larger migration from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] and neighboring areas. This migration was a reaction to religious wars, poverty, and [[religious persecution]] in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The first Amish immigrants went to the region that became [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]],  but later moved, motivated by land issues and by security concerns tied to the [[French and Indian War]].{{Citation needed| date=September 2009}} Many eventually settled in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. Other groups later settled elsewhere in North America.\n\n===1850\u20131878 Division into Old Orders and Amish Mennonites===\n{{Main|Old Order Movement}}\nMost Amish communities that were established in North America did not ultimately retain their Amish identity. The major division that resulted in the loss of identity of many Amish congregations occurred in the third quarter of the 19th century. The forming of factions worked its way out at different times at different places. The process was rather a \"sorting out\" than a split. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation at another place that fits them best.\n\nIn the years after 1850, tensions rose within individual Amish congregations and between different Amish congregations. Between 1862 and 1878, yearly {{lang|pdc|Dienerversammlungen}} (ministerial conferences) were held at different places, concerning how the Amish should deal with the tensions caused by the pressures of modern society.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 159}} The meetings themselves were a progressive idea; for bishops to assemble to discuss uniformity was an unprecedented notion in the Amish church.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By the first several meetings, the more traditionally minded bishops agreed to [[boycott]] the conferences.\n\nThe more progressive members, comprising roughly two-thirds of the group, became known by the name Amish Mennonite, and eventually united with the [[Mennonite Church (1683\u20132002)|Mennonite Church]], and other Mennonite denominations, mostly in the early 20th century. The more traditionally minded groups became known as the Old Order Amish.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 157\u201378}} The [[Fellowship of Evangelical Churches|Egli Amish]] had already started to withdraw from the Amish church in 1858. They soon drifted away from the old ways and changed their name to \"Defenseless Mennonite\" in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fecministries.org/our-beliefs/history/ |title=Our History |website=Fecministries.org |access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref> Congregations who took no side in the division after 1862 formed the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference|Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference]] in 1910, but dropped the word \"Amish\" from their name in 1957.<ref>[[Stephen Scott (writer)|Stephen Scott]]. ''An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups''. Intercourse, Penn.: 1996, pp. 122\u201323.</ref>\n\nBecause no division occurred in Europe, the Amish congregations remaining there took the same way as the change-minded Amish Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the [[Mennonites]]. The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the [[Zweibr\u00fccken|Ixheim]] Amish congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in [[Alsace]], are descended directly from former Amish congregations.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992}}{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 227}}\n\na Aa the early 20th century, Old Order Amish identity was not linked to the use of technologies, as the Old Order Amish and their rural neighbors used the same farm and household technologies. Questions about the use of technologies also did not play a role in the Old Order division of the second half of the 19th century. Telephones were the first important technology that was rejected, soon followed by the rejection of cars, tractors, radios, and many other technological inventions of the 20th century.<ref>Donald B.

The Amish's willingness to submit to the \"Will of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]\", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on the community. Modern innovations such as electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity. Electric power lines would be going against the Bible, which says that you shall not be \"conformed to the world\" ({{bibleref2|Romans|12:2}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Way of life==\n{{Main|Amish way of life}}\n\n[[File:DSCN4624 holmescountyamishbuggy e.jpg|right|thumb|alt=See description.|Amish couple in horse-driven buggy in rural [[Holmes County, Ohio]], September 2004]]\n\nAmish lifestyle is regulated by the {{lang|de|[[Ordnung]]}} (\"order\"),<ref name=PBSAE/> which differs slightly from community to community and from district to district within a community.

Men wear solid colored shirts, broad-brimmed hats, and suits that signify similarity amongst one another.  Amish men grow beards to symbolize manhood and marital status, as well as to promote humility.  They are forbidden to grow mustaches because mustaches are seen by the Amish as being affiliated with the military, which they are strongly opposed to, due to their pacifist beliefs.  Women have similar guidelines on how to dress, which are also expressed in the {{lang|de|Ordnung}}, the Amish version of legislation.  They are to wear calf-length dresses, muted colors along with bonnets and aprons.  Prayer caps or bonnets are worn by the women because they are a visual representation of their religious beliefs and promote unity through the tradition of every women wearing one.  The color of the bonnet signifies whether a woman is single or married.  Single women wear black bonnets and married women wear white.  The color coding of bonnets is important because women are not allowed to wear jewelry, such as wedding rings, as it is seen as drawing attention to the body which can induce pride in the individual.<ref name=\"Plain Diversity\">{{Cite book |last=Nolt |first=Steven M. |title=Plain Diversity: Amish Cultures and Identities (Young Center Books in Anabaptist and Pietist Studies) |last2=Meyers |first2=Thomas J. |date=June 1, 2007 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press (June 1, 2007) |isbn=978-0801886058}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2019}}  All clothing is sewn by hand, but the way to fasten the garment widely depends on whether the Amish person is a part of the New Order or Old Order Amish.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Klein |first=H.

Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish.

Certain Mennonite churches have a high number of people who were formerly from Amish congregations. Although more Amish immigrated to North America in the 19th century than during the 18th century, most of today's Amish descend from 18th-century immigrants. The latter tended to emphasize tradition to a greater extent, and were perhaps more likely to maintain a separate Amish identity.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 104}}  There are a number of Amish Mennonite church groups that had never in their history been associated with the Old Order Amish because they split from the Amish mainstream in the time when the Old Orders formed in the 1860s and 1870s.

The members of these groups are largely of Amish origin, but they are not in fellowship with other Amish groups because they adhere to theological doctrines (e.g., [[assurance of salvation]]) or practices ([[community of goods]]) that are normally not accepted among mainstream Amish. The [[Bergholz Community]] is a different case, it is not seen as Amish anymore because the community has shifted away from many core Amish principles.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n| shading     = off\n| percentages = pagr\n| 1920 | 5000\n| 1928 | 7000\n| 1936 | 9000\n| 1944 | 13000\n| 1952 | 19000\n| 1960 | 28000\n| 1968 | 39000\n| 1976 | 57000\n| 1984 | 84000\n| 1992 | 128150\n| 2000 | 166000\n| 2010 | 249500\n| 2019 | 341900\n| footnote = Source: 1992,<ref name=\"2013 population\">{{Cite web |url=http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/Population_Trends_1992_2013.asp |title=Amish Population Trends 1992\u20132013 |publisher=Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies, Elizabethtown College |access-date=June 12, 2013}}</ref> 2000,<ref name=\"etown\">{{Cite web |url=http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/PDF/Statistics/Population_Change_Summary_1992_2008.pdf |title=Amish Population Change Summary 1992\u20132008 |publisher=Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies, Elizabethtown College |access-date=July 8, 2009}}</ref> 2010,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/files/2016/06/Population_Change_2010-2015.pdf |title=Amish Population Change, 2010\u20132015 (Alphabetical Order) |website=Groups.etown.edu |access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref> 2019<ref name=\"Elizabethtown College, the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies\" />\n}}\n\nBecause the Amish are usually baptized no earlier than 18 and children are not counted in local congregation numbers, estimating their numbers is difficult.

They are closely related to, but distinct from, [[Mennonite]] churches. The Amish are known for [[simple living]], [[plain dress]], and reluctance to adopt many [[Convenience|conveniences of modern technology]].\n\nThe history of the Amish church began with a [[schism (religion)|schism]] in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Anabaptist]]s in 1693 led by [[Jakob Ammann]].{{Sfn | Kraybill | 2001 | pp = 7\u20138}} Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 2001 | p = 8}} In the second half of the 19th century, the Amish divided into Old Order Amish and [[Amish Mennonite]]s. The latter do not eschew motor cars, whereas the Old Order Amish retained much of their traditional culture. When people refer to the Amish today, they normally refer to the Old Order Amish.\n\nIn the early 18th century, many Amish and Mennonites immigrated to [[Pennsylvania]] for a variety of reasons. Today, the Old Order Amish, the [[New Order Amish]], and the [[Old Beachy Amish]] continue to speak [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], also known as \"Pennsylvania Dutch\", although two different [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] are used by Old Order Amish in [[Adams County, Indiana|Adams]] and [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen]] counties in [[Indiana]].<ref name=\"gameo\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/B4762.html |title=Berne, Indiana, Old Order Amish Settlement |last=Zook |first= Noah| first2=Samuel L |last2=Yoder |year=1998 |publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |access-date=April 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2000}}, over 165,000 Old Order Amish lived in the United States and about 1,500 lived in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/amish.htm |title=The Amish: history, beliefs, practices, etc |publisher=Religious tolerance |access-date=November 25, 2011}}</ref> A 2008 study suggested their numbers had increased to 227,000,<ref name=\"Scolforo\">{{Cite news |last=Scolforo |first=Mark |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-20-3770622862_x.htm |title=Amish population nearly doubles in 16 years |date=August 20, 2008 |work=USA Today |access-date=February 3, 2011 |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> and in 2010, a study suggested their population had grown by 10 percent in the past two years to 249,000, with increasing movement to the West.<ref name=\"Amish Population Growth: Numbers Increasing, Heading West\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/amish-population-growth-n_n_663323.html |title=Amish Population Growth: Numbers Increasing, Heading West |last=Scolforo |first=Mark |date=July 28, 2010 |website=The Huffington Post |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730110138/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/amish-population-growth-n_n_663323.html |archive-date=July 30, 2010 |access-date=July 29, 2010}}</ref> Most of the Amish continue to have six or seven children, while benefiting from the major decrease in infant and maternal mortality in the 20th century.

It is a requirement for marriage within the Amish church. Once a person is baptized within the church, he or she may marry only within the faith.  Church districts have between 20 and 40 families and worship services are held every other Sunday in a member's home. The district is led by a bishop and several ministers and deacons.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 1994 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=OYNYKYsulbQC&pg=PA3 3]}}  The rules of the church, the ''[[Ordnung]]'', must be observed by every member and cover many aspects of day-to-day living, including prohibitions or limitations on the use of power-line electricity, telephones, and automobiles, as well as regulations on clothing.  Most Amish do not buy commercial insurance or participate in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].  As [[Anabaptist#Today|present-day Anabaptists]], Amish church members practice [[nonresistance]] and will not perform any type of military service. The Amish value rural life, manual labor, and humility, all under the auspices of living what they interpret to be God's word.\n\nMembers who do not conform to these community expectations and who cannot be convinced to [[repentance|repent]] are excommunicated. In addition to [[excommunication]], members may be [[Shunning|shunned]],<ref name=\"PBSAE\">''[[The Amish (film)|American Experience: The Amish]]''</ref> a practice that limits social contacts to shame the wayward member into returning to the church.

In [[Z\u00fcrich]] on January 21, 1525, [[Conrad Grebel]] and [[George Blaurock]] practiced adult baptism to each other and then to others.<ref>Anthony L. Chute, Nathan A. Finn, Michael A.&nbsp;G.

''Anabaptist History and Theology: An Introduction''. Kitchener, Ontario, 1995, p. 62.</ref>\n\n=== Emergence of the Amish ===\nThe term Amish was first used as a {{lang|pdc|Schandename}} (a term of disgrace) in 1710 by opponents of [[Jakob Amman]]. The first informal division between Swiss Brethren was recorded in the 17th century between {{lang|pdc|Oberl\u00e4nder}}s ([[Bernese Highlands|those living in the hills]]) and {{lang|pdc|Emmentaler}} (those living in the [[Emmental]] valley). The {{lang|pdc|Oberl\u00e4nder}}s were a more extreme congregation; their zeal pushed them into more remote areas and their solitude made them more zealous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nSwiss Anabaptism developed, from this point, in two parallel streams, most clearly marked by disagreement over the preferred treatment of \"fallen\" believers. The Emmentalers (sometimes referred to as Reistians, after bishop [[Hans Reist]], a leader among the Emmentalers) argued that fallen believers should only be withheld from [[Holy Communion|communion]], and not regular meals.  The Amish argued that those who had been banned should be avoided even in common meals.  The Reistian side eventually formed the basis of the [[Swiss Mennonite Conference]]. Because of this common heritage, Amish and Mennonites from southern Germany and Switzerland retain many similarities. Those who leave the Amish fold tend to join various congregations of [[Conservative Mennonites]].{{Sfn | Smith | Krahn | 1981 | pp = 212\u201314}}{{Sfn | Kraybill| 2000| pp = 63\u201364}}\n\n=== Migration to North America ===\nAmish began migrating to Pennsylvania, then known for its [[religious toleration]], in 1727<ref>[https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/here-are-takeaways-from-our-conversation-with-don-kraybill-on/article_6cc6a48a-8461-11e8-8418-23f57668ebfe.html 6 takeaways from our conversation with Don Kraybill] at lancasteronline.com.</ref>  as part of a larger migration from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] and neighboring areas. This migration was a reaction to religious wars, poverty, and [[religious persecution]] in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The first Amish immigrants went to the region that became [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]],  but later moved, motivated by land issues and by security concerns tied to the [[French and Indian War]].{{Citation needed| date=September 2009}} Many eventually settled in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. Other groups later settled elsewhere in North America.\n\n===1850\u20131878 Division into Old Orders and Amish Mennonites===\n{{Main|Old Order Movement}}\nMost Amish communities that were established in North America did not ultimately retain their Amish identity. The major division that resulted in the loss of identity of many Amish congregations occurred in the third quarter of the 19th century. The forming of factions worked its way out at different times at different places. The process was rather a \"sorting out\" than a split. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation at another place that fits them best.\n\nIn the years after 1850, tensions rose within individual Amish congregations and between different Amish congregations. Between 1862 and 1878, yearly {{lang|pdc|Dienerversammlungen}} (ministerial conferences) were held at different places, concerning how the Amish should deal with the tensions caused by the pressures of modern society.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 159}} The meetings themselves were a progressive idea; for bishops to assemble to discuss uniformity was an unprecedented notion in the Amish church.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By the first several meetings, the more traditionally minded bishops agreed to [[boycott]] the conferences.\n\nThe more progressive members, comprising roughly two-thirds of the group, became known by the name Amish Mennonite, and eventually united with the [[Mennonite Church (1683\u20132002)|Mennonite Church]], and other Mennonite denominations, mostly in the early 20th century. The more traditionally minded groups became known as the Old Order Amish.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 157\u201378}} The [[Fellowship of Evangelical Churches|Egli Amish]] had already started to withdraw from the Amish church in 1858. They soon drifted away from the old ways and changed their name to \"Defenseless Mennonite\" in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fecministries.org/our-beliefs/history/ |title=Our History |website=Fecministries.org |access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref> Congregations who took no side in the division after 1862 formed the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference|Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference]] in 1910, but dropped the word \"Amish\" from their name in 1957.<ref>[[Stephen Scott (writer)|Stephen Scott]]. ''An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups''. Intercourse, Penn.: 1996, pp. 122\u201323.</ref>\n\nBecause no division occurred in Europe, the Amish congregations remaining there took the same way as the change-minded Amish Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the [[Mennonites]]. The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the [[Zweibr\u00fccken|Ixheim]] Amish congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in [[Alsace]], are descended directly from former Amish congregations.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992}}{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 227}}\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThough splits happened among the Old Order in the 19th century in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, a major split among the Old Orders took until  [[World War I]]. At that time, two very conservative affiliations emerged \u2013 the [[Swartzentruber Amish]] in [[Holmes County, Ohio]], and the [[Buchanan Amish affiliation|Buchanan Amish]] in [[Iowa]]. The Buchanan Amish soon were joined by like-minded congregations all over the country.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 264\u201366}}\n\nWith World War I came the massive [[German language in the United States#Persecution during World War I|suppression of the German language in the US]] that eventually led to language shift of most Pennsylvania German speakers, leaving the Amish and other [[Old Order Movement|Old Orders]] as almost the only speakers by the end of the 20th century. This created a [[language barrier]] around the Amish that did not exist before in that form.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2013, p. 122.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1920s, the more change minded faction of the Old Order Amish, that wanted to adopt the car, broke away from the mainstream and organized under the name [[Beachy Amish]].{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 278\u201381}}\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], the old question of [[military service]] for the Amish came up again. Because Amish young men in general refused military service, they ended up in the [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS), where they worked mainly in forestry and hospitals. The fact that many young men worked in hospitals, where they had a lot of contact with more progressive Mennonites and the outside world, had the result that many of these men never joined the Amish church.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 287\u201390}}\n\nIn the 1950s, the Beachy Amish transformed into an evangelical church. The ones who wanted to preserve the old way of the Beachy became the [[Old Beachy Amish]].{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 278\u201381}}\n\nUntil about 1950, almost all Amish children attended small, local, non-Amish schools, but then school consolidation and mandatory schooling beyond eighth grade caused Amish opposition. Amish communities opened their own Amish schools. In 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] exempted Amish pupils from [[compulsory education]] past [[junior high school|eighth grade]]. By the end of the 20th century, almost all Amish children attended Amish schools.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt (2013). ''The Amish''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 250\u201355.</ref>\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, a growing number of Amish men left farm work and started small businesses because of increasing pressure on small-scale farming. Though a wide variety of small businesses exists among the Amish, construction work and woodworking are quite widespread.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt.

Questions about the use of technologies also did not play a role in the Old Order division of the second half of the 19th century. Telephones were the first important technology that was rejected, soon followed by the rejection of cars, tractors, radios, and many other technological inventions of the 20th century.<ref>Donald B.

The Amish's willingness to submit to the \"Will of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]\", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on the community. Modern innovations such as electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity.

Men wear solid colored shirts, broad-brimmed hats, and suits that signify similarity amongst one another.  Amish men grow beards to symbolize manhood and marital status, as well as to promote humility.  They are forbidden to grow mustaches because mustaches are seen by the Amish as being affiliated with the military, which they are strongly opposed to, due to their pacifist beliefs.  Women have similar guidelines on how to dress, which are also expressed in the {{lang|de|Ordnung}}, the Amish version of legislation.  They are to wear calf-length dresses, muted colors along with bonnets and aprons.  Prayer caps or bonnets are worn by the women because they are a visual representation of their religious beliefs and promote unity through the tradition of every women wearing one.  The color of the bonnet signifies whether a woman is single or married.  Single women wear black bonnets and married women wear white.  The color coding of bonnets is important because women are not allowed to wear jewelry, such as wedding rings, as it is seen as drawing attention to the body which can induce pride in the individual.<ref name=\"Plain Diversity\">{{Cite book |last=Nolt |first=Steven M. |title=Plain Diversity: Amish Cultures and Identities (Young Center Books in Anabaptist and Pietist Studies) |last2=Meyers |first2=Thomas J. |date=June 1, 2007 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press (June 1, 2007) |isbn=978-0801886058}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2019}}  All clothing is sewn by hand, but the way to fasten the garment widely depends on whether the Amish person is a part of the New Order or Old Order Amish.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Klein |first=H.

The largest group, the \"Old Order\" Amish, a conservative faction that separated from other Amish in the 1860s, are those who have most emphasized traditional practices and beliefs. The [[New Order Amish]] are a group of Amish whom some scholars see best described as a subgroup of Old Order Amish, despite the name.\n\n===Affiliations===\nAbout 40 different Old Order Amish affiliations are known; the eight major affiliations are below, with Lancaster as the largest one in number of districts and population:<ref>Kraybill, Donald B., Karen M.

Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish.

Certain Mennonite churches have a high number of people who were formerly from Amish congregations. Although more Amish immigrated to North America in the 19th century than during the 18th century, most of today's Amish descend from 18th-century immigrants. The latter tended to emphasize tradition to a greater extent, and were perhaps more likely to maintain a separate Amish identity.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 104}}  There are a number of Amish Mennonite church groups that had never in their history been associated with the Old Order Amish because they split from the Amish mainstream in the time when the Old Orders formed in the 1860s and 1870s.

The members of these groups are largely of Amish origin, but they are not in fellowship with other Amish groups because they adhere to theological doctrines (e.g., [[assurance of salvation]]) or practices ([[community of goods]]) that are normally not accepted among mainstream Amish.

Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship (stating that she \"is a girl who is a friend, but is not my girlfriend\").

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

In [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|the series finale]], both Sheldon and Amy are recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for their discovery of super asymmetry which they first worked on moments before their wedding. In Amy's speech, she encourages young girls around the world to study whatever they want. Instead of giving a self-centered speech, Sheldon [[The_Big_Bang_Theory_(season_12)#speech|thanks]] his family, his friends and his wife Amy for always supporting him.\n\nHe once idolized fictional prodigy [[Wesley Crusher]] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', portrayed by Wil Wheaton, until Wheaton did not show up at a convention attended by Sheldon in 1995. Sheldon had spent 15 hours on a bus travelling to the convention during which time he was forced to break his rule about urinating in a moving vehicle. After this moment Wil Wheaton became number six on Sheldon's mortal enemy list (a list he started when he was 9 on a 5\u00bc-inch [[floppy disk]]). Wheaton was one of Sheldon's mortal enemies, along with his coworkers [[Barry Kripke]] and [[Leslie Winkle]].

He also has a maternal aunt, Charlene, which was revealed in ''Young Sheldon'' when his mother told Meemaw that she made dinner for \u201cCharlene and Edward\u201d more times than her.

Their relationship continues in season 4, although Sheldon often points out that they are not in a romantic relationship (stating that she \"is a girl who is a friend, but is not my girlfriend\").

In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Cooper/Kripke Inversion]]\", after being directly asked by Penny if he would ever have sex with Amy, Sheldon admits to Penny and Leonard that a physical relationship with Amy is a possibility, and being touched is something he is working on. While upset about Kripke, Amy does give him a consoling hug that Sheldon seems to need, and want. Even so, Amy has offered other romantic physical contact, and was very uncomfortable when they had to cuddle. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Spoiler Alert Segmentation]]\", Leonard temporarily moves out and Amy proposes that she would be his perfect roommate and tries to move in, though Sheldon is uncomfortable with this change in their relationship. While playing Dungeons and Dragons during \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|The Love Spell Potential]]\", Sheldon's and Amy's characters are commanded to have sex within the game. A very upset Amy asks Sheldon if they are ever going to be intimate and he again admits that it is a possibility.\n\nIn season 7, Sheldon passionately kisses Amy on the lips for the first time. Initially to prove a point, he later prolonged it, implying he enjoyed the feeling.<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep15|The Locomotive Manipulation]]|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 6, 2014|season=7|number=15}}</ref> Later episodes showed him willingly kissing Amy, implying he has gotten more comfortable in such a position of physical intimacy. The ultimate proof of Sheldon having feelings for Amy is given in the season 8 episode \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Prom Equivalency]]\", when he finally admits being in love with her: \"I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, but that seems even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love.\" In the season 8 finale, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|The Commitment Determination]]\", Sheldon and Amy get into a fight over their definition of \"commitment\".  Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has decided to take a break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. He glumly reveals that he had been planning on proposing to Amy with his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom.\n\nIn the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Platonic Permutation]]\" Amy offers Sheldon to get back together with her after spending time together in an aquarium at Thanksgiving, but sadly learns that he simply just wants to be her friend, with him revealing to her that \"I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them\". In \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Earworm Reverberation]]\", Sheldon can't get a [[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|song]] out his head, but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that the song was about Amy and that she changed his life for the better, which prompts him to go to her apartment to profess his love. He finds Amy on a date with Dave, who has a great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect. Seeing how much they love each other, Dave gleefully urges Sheldon to kiss Amy, leading to their reunion. In the following episode, \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|The Opening Night Excitation]]\" Leonard, Howard and Raj go to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' without Sheldon as while he was initially reluctant, ultimately opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. To make Amy's birthday enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate.  He reveals to them that he has narrowed things down to three options, the first being a chance to play the [[harp]] with the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], the second being an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's [[ornithophobia]] is nothing compared to his fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in [[coitus]], at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. After Penny and Bernadette convince him that finally being intimate with her is the most beautiful gift that he could give to her, Sheldon and Amy have sex for the first time on the latter's birthday.\n\nIn season 10, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Experimentation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 10)#ep4|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 10, 2016|season=10|number=4}}</ref> and after its successful run, decide to move in together permanently.<ref name=\"The Veracity Elasticity\"/> In its season finale, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki.

There\u2019s a lot of interesting features to all of our characters that make them technically unconventional socially.... And what we\u2019re trying to show with our show is that this is a group of people who likely were teased, mocked, told that they will never be appreciated or loved, and we have a group of people who have successful careers, active social lives (that involve things like Dungeons and Dragons and video games), but they also have relationships, and that\u2019s a fulfilling and satisfying life.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Jim|title='Is Sheldon autistic?

It is the sequel to 2012's ''[[Borderlands 2]]'', and the fourth main entry in the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]]. ''Borderlands 3'' was released on 13 September 2019 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and on 30 October 2019 for [[MacOS|Apple macOS]]. A [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] port was released on 17 December 2019.\n\nPlayers complete quests and side missions, in single-player or multiplayer, as one of four classes. When killed, enemies may drop weapons and gear which can be equipped. New abilities are unlocked as the player gains [[experience point|experience]]. The plot is centered around stopping the cult-leading twins, Troy and Tyreen Calypso, from harnessing the power of the alien Vaults spread across the galaxy.\n\nUpon release, ''Borderlands 3'' received generally favorable reviews, though some criticized the lack of innovation and technical issues. The initial sales of the game were the highest of the ''Borderlands'' series: more than five million copies were sold in five days.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{main|Borderlands (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Borderlands series}}\n''Borderlands 3'' is a [[first-person shooter|first-person]] [[loot shooter]]. Players, either playing alone or in parties of up to four people, make a character from one of the four classes available, and take on various missions given out by non-playable characters (NPCs) and at bounty boards to gain [[experience point|experience]], in-game monetary rewards, and reward items. Players can also gain these items by defeating enemies throughout the game. As the player gains level, they gain skills points to allocate across a [[skill tree]]. The game introduces four new playable characters: Amara, a \"Siren\" who summons ethereal fists; Moze, a young \"Gunner\" who rides the [[mecha]] Iron Bear; Zane, an \"Operative\" with a variety of gadgets; and FL4K, a robot \"Beastmaster\" who summons creatures to aid in fights.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gurwin |first1=Gabe |title=From story to characters, here\u2019s everything we know about Borderlands 3 |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/borderlands-3-everything-we-know-characters-story-and-more/ |accessdate=10 April 2019 |work=www.digitaltrends.com |date=9 April 2019}}</ref> Unlike previous ''Borderlands'' games where each character had only one unique skill that operates on a [[cooldown]], each character in the new game can unlock three unique skills, though only one (or in Zane's case, two) can be equipped at a time, greatly expanding the number of potential character builds a player can make.\n\n''Borderlands 3'' shares the same core loop with previous games around taking on missions, defeating enemies, and obtaining loot from fallen foes or special chests, most often in the form of [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] weapons to vary in damage, range, ammo capacity, and other special perks, giving the game \"over one billion guns\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://borderlands.com/en-US/game-info/|title=Borderlands - Game Info|website=borderlands.com|language=en|access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref> Perks can include elemental effects, such as damaging the foes with fire, ice, or electricity, or may possess alternative firing behavior, among other visual differences.<ref name=\"pcgamer gameplay\"/> In ''Borderlands 2'', some weapons had \"slag\" elemental, which coated the enemy for a short period and made them extremely vulnerable to a subsequent elemental attack from a different element. Slag weapons have been replaced with [[radiation]]; the coating and subsequent vulnerability remains the same as slag, but radiation damage will also hurt enemies over time on its own and can potentially spread to other enemies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-will-have-a-new-elemental-damage-type-radiation/|title=Borderlands 3 will have a new elemental damage type: Radiation|last=Macgregor|first=Jody|date=22 April 2019|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref> The in-game manufacture of the guns also plays a larger role in the type of perks a weapon can have. Tediore guns can be thrown when empty and create additional effects, Atlas have tracking bullets to hunt down enemies in cover, and Hyperion can have shields that absorb damage and use that for other purposes such as healing.<ref name=\"pcgamer gameplay\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/hands-on-borderlands-3-is-a-bigger-smarter-borderlands-2/  |title = Hands-on: Borderlands 3 is a bigger, smarter Borderlands 2 | first = James | last = Davenport | date = 1 May 2019 | accessdate = 1 May 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> Other randomly-generated items include class modifiers, grenade modifiers, and shield kits.

In decades prior, several corporations and bandit clans have laid siege to Pandora to try to find the Vaults, but the constant conflict and bloodshed has left the planet and its population ravaged and crazed. However, there are still those independently searching for the Vaults, known as Vault Hunters (the player characters).\n\n''Borderlands 3'' takes place seven years after [[Handsome Jack]]'s death in ''[[Borderlands 2]]'' and the downfall of the Hyperion Corporation in ''[[Tales from the Borderlands]]''. In ''Borderlands 2'', it was discovered that numerous other Vaults exist on other planets in the galaxy. In the power vacuum left by the defeat of Jack and Hyperion, twin siblings Troy and Tyreen Calypso form the Children of the Vault (COV), a violent [[cult of personality]] formed from the remnants of the planet's many bandit factions, to gain possession of the other Vaults, specifically one called 'the Great Vault'. Lilith, one of the playable Vault Hunters from [[Borderlands (video game)|the first game]] and current leader of the Crimson Raiders, a resistance force created to protect Pandora, recruits new Vault Hunters to help stop the Calypsos.<ref name=\"Polygon 28 March 2019\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/28/18284249/borderlands-3-announcement-trailer-gearbox-release-date|title=Borderlands 3 announced: watch the first trailer|last1=McWhertor|first1=Michael|date=28 March 2019|work=Polygon|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=pcgamer28march2019>{{cite web|work=PC Gamer|date=28 March 2019|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-everything-we-know/|last1=Petitte|first1=Omri|last2=Wilde|first2=Tyler|last3=Brown|first3=Fraser|title=Borderlands 3: Everything we know so far}}</ref>\n\nSeveral characters from past ''Borderlands'' games make a return. Previously playable Vault Hunters Claptrap, Zer0, Maya, Brick, and Mordecai appear as NPCs assisting the player. Aurelia, Sir Hammerlock's sister and one of the playable Vault Hunters in ''[[Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel]]'', also appears as a boss. Returning NPCs include gun salesman Marcus Kincaid, explosives expert Tiny Tina (now going by just Tina), Miss Mad Moxxi and her mechanic daughter Ellie, cyborg hunter Sir Alistair Hammerlock, archaeologist Patricia Tannis, weapons manufacturer Mr. Torgue, and Crazy Earl. Rhys Strongfork, one of the two playable protagonists in ''Tales from the Borderlands'', and his best friend Vaughn also appear. Timothy Lawrence, a body double of Handsome Jack and one of the playable Vault Hunters in ''The Pre-Sequel'', and Gaige, one of the playable Vault Hunters in ''Borderlands 2'', are featured as NPCs in the game's DLC campaigns.\n\n====Synopsis====\nAnswering a recruiting call from the Crimson Raiders, a new team of Vault Hunters (Amara, Moze, Zane, and FL4K) arrive on Pandora only to find that the Crimson Raiders have been put on the brink of annihilation at the hands of the Children of the Vault (COV). They meet Lilith, who orders them to recover a Vault map that was lost years ago but recently ended up in the hands of the COV. With help from bandit chief Vaughn and Patricia Tannis, the Vault Hunters are able to recover the map, which directs them to the city-planet of Promethea, the location of the first discovered Vault and the Atlas Corporation's headquarters. However, before they can depart, they are ambushed by Tyreen and Troy who reveal they are both Sirens from being conjoined at birth and that Troy needs Tyreen's powers to survive. Tyreen demonstrates her unique ability to drain the life force from other living beings by stealing Lilith's powers. The Calypso Twins take the map and leave for Promethea.\n\nThe Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders take their own ship, the ''Sanctuary III'', to Promethea to reach the Vault first. On arrival, they find the planet under attack by Maliwan and COV forces, as Maliwan's Head of Mergers and Acquisitions, Katagawa Jr., has joined forces with the Calypso Twins to attack the planet, intent on a hostile takeover of Atlas, the company now owned by Rhys. The Vault Hunters help Rhys and his subordinates, Zer0 and Lorelei, to temporarily stall the attack, after which Rhys directs them to the planet Athenas where the Promethean Vault Key is safely kept. On Athenas, the Vault Hunters help Maya and her apprentice Ava fend off more COV and Maliwan forces to recover the Key, learning it is only one-third of the complete artifact. Maya and Ava join the Crimson Raiders as they return to Promethea, disable Maliwan's orbital laser cannon which is powered by the second part of the Key, and help kill Katawaga Jr. during a final assault on Atlas HQ. Rhys provides them with the last part of the Key and directs them to the buried Vault. Maya and the Vault Hunters race the COV to the Promethea Vault, where they encounter and defeat the Rampager, a massive alien beast. The Calypso Twins then arrive, and Tyreen absorbs the dead Rampager's power, revealing their plan to absorb the power of the Vault monsters on their way to the Great Vault. Ava, who had disobeyed Maya's order to stay on ''Sanctuary'', attempts to fight the twins but is easily overpowered. Maya intervenes to save her, but Troy kills her by draining her of her life force and powers, infuriating Ava.\n\nThe Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders head to the location of the next Vault on the preserved swamp planet of Eden-6, owned by the Jakobs family and corporation, where they find that the planet has already been invaded by the COV. After assisting Wainwright Jakobs, heir to the Jakobs corporation, he agrees to help the Vault Hunters obtain the Eden Vault Key if they rescue his lover Sir Alastair Hammerlock. The Vault Hunters team up with Brick, Mordecai, and Tina to rescue Hammerlock, who reveals he was betrayed by his sister Baroness Aurelia Hammerlock, who has sided with the Calypso Twins and seized the Jakobs Manor and company in exchange for handing them the Vault Key. The Vault Hunters gather the three pieces of the Eden-6 Vault Key and head to the Jakobs Manor to open the Vault where they encounter and kill Aurelia. The Vault Hunters open the Eden-6 Vault and kill the monster it contains, the Graveward. Tannis then uses a special device to drain the Graveward's energy before Tyreen can absorb it. Furious, the Calypsos kidnap Tannis and take her back to Pandora where they plan to publicly execute her.\n\nThe Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders return to Pandora, where they try to rescue Tannis from the Carnivora festival and COV live-streamers, Pain and Terror. During the rescue mission, Tannis reveals that she also has Siren powers, specifically to manipulate machines, which help turn the tide of the battle and she later explains that she inherited these powers from Angel after [[Borderlands 2|her death,]] a fact that both she and Lilith kept secret for her safety. Tannis warns the Vault Hunters that the Calypso Twins are preparing to open the Great Vault, being hidden on Pandora so they can drain the energy of the monster contained within it. The Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders assault the COV's main headquarters to stop the opening of the Great Vault, but are too late to prevent Troy from activating the Great Vault Key, which is the entire moon of Elpis. The Vault Hunters fight Troy and kill him, resulting in Ava taking back and inheriting Maya's Siren powers that he had stolen. Unfortunately, the Great Vault starts opening and Tyreen absorbs Troy's energy before escaping. The Vault Hunters are then contacted by Typhon DeLeon, the first Vault Hunter, who warns them that the Great Vault contains an interdimensional monster called [[Borderlands (video game)|the Destroyer]], which has the power to devour stars and destroy the entire universe. He summons the Vault Hunters to the long lost Eridian homeworld, Nekrotafeyo.\n\nAt Nekrotafeyo, Typhon further explains that the Great Vault isn't simply located on Pandora, but is actually the entire planet of Pandora itself. The Eridians created the planet to act as a prison and sacrificed their entire civilization to lure and contain the Destroyer, but left behind the machine they used, in case the Destroyer escaped or was released. As they gather the four Vault Keys needed to power the device, Tyreen reveals that Typhon is in fact her and Troy's father. Typhon admits that he had tried to keep the twins with him on Nekrotafeyo to protect them, but it only made them bitter and power-hungry instead. Tyreen intervenes and disables the machine before it can be used and mortally wounds Typhon before fleeing back to Pandora. The Vault Hunters follow Tyreen just as she merges herself with the Destroyer and battles them. The Vault Hunters kill Tyreen and the Destroyer, and Lilith regains her Siren powers. However, Elpis still threatens to destroy Pandora as it continues to open the Great Vault. Lilith sacrifices herself to shut down Elpis, permanently leaving a flaming Firehawk sign branded on the moon.\n\nDuring the credits, scenes depict the Vault Hunters, the Crimson Raiders, and their allies honoring and memorializing Lilith, Tannis speculating her possible whereabouts, Rhys and Vaughn reuniting properly after years, Wainwright proposing to Hammerlock, Tina, Brick, and Mordecai playing ''Bunkers and Badasses'', and ending with a shot of everyone looking at the Firehawk sigil as a reminder of Lilith lighting the way for Vault Hunters and protecting Pandora forever.\n\n==Development==\n\n\n''Borderlands 3'' was developed jointly by Gearbox's Texas and Quebec studios. Gearbox had finished ''Borderlands'' and its sequel consecutively, leaving the studio somewhat burned out on the franchise. To try to do something different, Gearbox shifted work into ''[[Battleborn (video game)|Battleborn]]'' with the blessing of 2K Games, as a means of refreshing themselves. ''Battleborn'' was not a major success, but Gearbox was not disheartened on this. According to art director Scott Kester, while developing ''Battleborn'', they gained several ideas for how to take the next ''Borderlands'' game, and many of the team, as soon as ''Battleborn'' was complete, started building out these ideas for ''Borderlands 3''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/28/borderlands-3-preview-and-interview-were-here-to-make-a-borderlands-game-were-not-here-to-make-somebody-elses-game-10083552/ | title=  Borderlands 3 preview and interview \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re here to make a Borderlands game, we\u2019re not here to make somebody else\u2019s game\u2019 | date = 28 June 2019 | accessdate = 1 July 2019 | work = [[Metro (UK newspaper)|Metro]] }}</ref>\n\nGearbox Quebec undertook developing ''Borderlands 3'' as their first assignment, and said that they were doing so without compulsory overtime (\"[[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]]\").<ref>{{cite news |title=Borderlands 3 Created Completely Without \"Crunch\", Says Developer |url=https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-3-created-completely-without-crunch-says-developer/ |accessdate=6 June 2019 |work=TheGamer |date=5 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lavoie |first1=Rapha\u00ebl |title=Borderlands 3: Qu\u00e9bec crinquera le volume \u00e0 \"11\" |url=https://www.pesesurstart.com/2019/06/04/borderlands-3-quebec-crinquera-le-volume-a-11-dans-un-volet-joyeusement-demesure-entrevue |accessdate=6 June 2019 |work=P\u00e8se sur start |date=4 June 2019}}</ref> The game was announced with a trailer at [[PAX East]] on 28 March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Delahunty-Light |first1=Zoe |title=The Borderlands 3 trailer is here and it\u2019s everything you wanted |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/borderlands-3-trailer/ |accessdate=28 March 2019 |work=Gamesradar+ |language=en}}</ref> The trailer received mixed reviews by video game websites, some of which characterized it as too similar in appearance and content to previous entries in the series such as ''[[Borderlands 2]]''.<ref name=gamespot29march2019>{{cite web|work=Gamespot|last1=Seipke|first1=Jean-Luc|last2=Ramee|first2=Jordan|date=29 March 2019|url=https://www.gamespot.com/videos/borderlands-3s-debut-trailer-didnt-impress-us-as-m/2300-6448973/|title=Borderlands 3's Debut Trailer Didn't Impress Us As Much As We Hoped}}</ref><ref name=polygon28march2019>{{cite web|work=Polygon|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/28/18285523/borderlands-3-trailer-reaction|date=28 March 2019|title=Borderlands 3\u2019s trailer is a disappointment|last=Kuchera|first=Ben}}</ref>\n\nTo help bridge the gap between ''Borderlands 2'' and ''Tales from the Borderlands'' to ''Borderlands 3'', Gearbox released new DLC for ''Borderlands 2'', \"Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary\", in June 2019, making it free for a limited time to current owners of ''Borderlands 2''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/commander-lilith-and-the-fight-for-sanctuary-is-a-new-borderlands-2-dlc-and-you-can-get-it-free/ | title = Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary is a new Borderlands 2 DLC and you can get it free | first = Jody | last =MacGregor | date = 8 June 2019 | accessdate = 1 July 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nSeveral voice actors reprised their roles, including [[Ashly Burch]] as Tiny Tina,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/14/18310466/borderlands-3-voice-actors-tiny-tina-ashly-burch-ps4-xbox-one-pc | title = Borderlands 3 brings back Ashly Burch in her first big role | first=  Owen | last = Good  |date = 14 April 2019 | accessdate = 14 April 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> and [[Chris Hardwick]] as Vaughn from ''Tales from the Borderlands''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652758/gearbox-chris-hardwick-reprise-former-role-borderlands-3-confirmation | title = Gearbox confirms Chris Hardwick will reprise former role for Borderlands 3 | first = Megan | last = Farokhmanesh | date = 5 June 2019 | accessdate = 5 June 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref> The recasting of other voice actors caused some controversy.

Players can also gain these items by defeating enemies throughout the game. As the player gains level, they gain skills points to allocate across a [[skill tree]]. The game introduces four new playable characters: Amara, a \"Siren\" who summons ethereal fists; Moze, a young \"Gunner\" who rides the [[mecha]] Iron Bear; Zane, an \"Operative\" with a variety of gadgets; and FL4K, a robot \"Beastmaster\" who summons creatures to aid in fights.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gurwin |first1=Gabe |title=From story to characters, here\u2019s everything we know about Borderlands 3 |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/borderlands-3-everything-we-know-characters-story-and-more/ |accessdate=10 April 2019 |work=www.digitaltrends.com |date=9 April 2019}}</ref> Unlike previous ''Borderlands'' games where each character had only one unique skill that operates on a [[cooldown]], each character in the new game can unlock three unique skills, though only one (or in Zane's case, two) can be equipped at a time, greatly expanding the number of potential character builds a player can make.\n\n''Borderlands 3'' shares the same core loop with previous games around taking on missions, defeating enemies, and obtaining loot from fallen foes or special chests, most often in the form of [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] weapons to vary in damage, range, ammo capacity, and other special perks, giving the game \"over one billion guns\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://borderlands.com/en-US/game-info/|title=Borderlands - Game Info|website=borderlands.com|language=en|access-date=30 August 2019}}</ref> Perks can include elemental effects, such as damaging the foes with fire, ice, or electricity, or may possess alternative firing behavior, among other visual differences.<ref name=\"pcgamer gameplay\"/> In ''Borderlands 2'', some weapons had \"slag\" elemental, which coated the enemy for a short period and made them extremely vulnerable to a subsequent elemental attack from a different element.

In decades prior, several corporations and bandit clans have laid siege to Pandora to try to find the Vaults, but the constant conflict and bloodshed has left the planet and its population ravaged and crazed. However, there are still those independently searching for the Vaults, known as Vault Hunters (the player characters).\n\n''Borderlands 3'' takes place seven years after [[Handsome Jack]]'s death in ''[[Borderlands 2]]'' and the downfall of the Hyperion Corporation in ''[[Tales from the Borderlands]]''. In ''Borderlands 2'', it was discovered that numerous other Vaults exist on other planets in the galaxy. In the power vacuum left by the defeat of Jack and Hyperion, twin siblings Troy and Tyreen Calypso form the Children of the Vault (COV), a violent [[cult of personality]] formed from the remnants of the planet's many bandit factions, to gain possession of the other Vaults, specifically one called 'the Great Vault'. Lilith, one of the playable Vault Hunters from [[Borderlands (video game)|the first game]] and current leader of the Crimson Raiders, a resistance force created to protect Pandora, recruits new Vault Hunters to help stop the Calypsos.<ref name=\"Polygon 28 March 2019\">{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/28/18284249/borderlands-3-announcement-trailer-gearbox-release-date|title=Borderlands 3 announced: watch the first trailer|last1=McWhertor|first1=Michael|date=28 March 2019|work=Polygon|accessdate=28 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=pcgamer28march2019>{{cite web|work=PC Gamer|date=28 March 2019|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-everything-we-know/|last1=Petitte|first1=Omri|last2=Wilde|first2=Tyler|last3=Brown|first3=Fraser|title=Borderlands 3: Everything we know so far}}</ref>\n\nSeveral characters from past ''Borderlands'' games make a return. Previously playable Vault Hunters Claptrap, Zer0, Maya, Brick, and Mordecai appear as NPCs assisting the player. Aurelia, Sir Hammerlock's sister and one of the playable Vault Hunters in ''[[Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel]]'', also appears as a boss. Returning NPCs include gun salesman Marcus Kincaid, explosives expert Tiny Tina (now going by just Tina), Miss Mad Moxxi and her mechanic daughter Ellie, cyborg hunter Sir Alistair Hammerlock, archaeologist Patricia Tannis, weapons manufacturer Mr. Torgue, and Crazy Earl. Rhys Strongfork, one of the two playable protagonists in ''Tales from the Borderlands'', and his best friend Vaughn also appear. Timothy Lawrence, a body double of Handsome Jack and one of the playable Vault Hunters in ''The Pre-Sequel'', and Gaige, one of the playable Vault Hunters in ''Borderlands 2'', are featured as NPCs in the game's DLC campaigns.\n\n====Synopsis====\nAnswering a recruiting call from the Crimson Raiders, a new team of Vault Hunters (Amara, Moze, Zane, and FL4K) arrive on Pandora only to find that the Crimson Raiders have been put on the brink of annihilation at the hands of the Children of the Vault (COV). They meet Lilith, who orders them to recover a Vault map that was lost years ago but recently ended up in the hands of the COV. With help from bandit chief Vaughn and Patricia Tannis, the Vault Hunters are able to recover the map, which directs them to the city-planet of Promethea, the location of the first discovered Vault and the Atlas Corporation's headquarters. However, before they can depart, they are ambushed by Tyreen and Troy who reveal they are both Sirens from being conjoined at birth and that Troy needs Tyreen's powers to survive. Tyreen demonstrates her unique ability to drain the life force from other living beings by stealing Lilith's powers. The Calypso Twins take the map and leave for Promethea.\n\nThe Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders take their own ship, the ''Sanctuary III'', to Promethea to reach the Vault first. On arrival, they find the planet under attack by Maliwan and COV forces, as Maliwan's Head of Mergers and Acquisitions, Katagawa Jr., has joined forces with the Calypso Twins to attack the planet, intent on a hostile takeover of Atlas, the company now owned by Rhys. The Vault Hunters help Rhys and his subordinates, Zer0 and Lorelei, to temporarily stall the attack, after which Rhys directs them to the planet Athenas where the Promethean Vault Key is safely kept. On Athenas, the Vault Hunters help Maya and her apprentice Ava fend off more COV and Maliwan forces to recover the Key, learning it is only one-third of the complete artifact. Maya and Ava join the Crimson Raiders as they return to Promethea, disable Maliwan's orbital laser cannon which is powered by the second part of the Key, and help kill Katawaga Jr. during a final assault on Atlas HQ. Rhys provides them with the last part of the Key and directs them to the buried Vault. Maya and the Vault Hunters race the COV to the Promethea Vault, where they encounter and defeat the Rampager, a massive alien beast. The Calypso Twins then arrive, and Tyreen absorbs the dead Rampager's power, revealing their plan to absorb the power of the Vault monsters on their way to the Great Vault. Ava, who had disobeyed Maya's order to stay on ''Sanctuary'', attempts to fight the twins but is easily overpowered. Maya intervenes to save her, but Troy kills her by draining her of her life force and powers, infuriating Ava.\n\nThe Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders head to the location of the next Vault on the preserved swamp planet of Eden-6, owned by the Jakobs family and corporation, where they find that the planet has already been invaded by the COV. After assisting Wainwright Jakobs, heir to the Jakobs corporation, he agrees to help the Vault Hunters obtain the Eden Vault Key if they rescue his lover Sir Alastair Hammerlock. The Vault Hunters team up with Brick, Mordecai, and Tina to rescue Hammerlock, who reveals he was betrayed by his sister Baroness Aurelia Hammerlock, who has sided with the Calypso Twins and seized the Jakobs Manor and company in exchange for handing them the Vault Key. The Vault Hunters gather the three pieces of the Eden-6 Vault Key and head to the Jakobs Manor to open the Vault where they encounter and kill Aurelia. The Vault Hunters open the Eden-6 Vault and kill the monster it contains, the Graveward. Tannis then uses a special device to drain the Graveward's energy before Tyreen can absorb it. Furious, the Calypsos kidnap Tannis and take her back to Pandora where they plan to publicly execute her.\n\nThe Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders return to Pandora, where they try to rescue Tannis from the Carnivora festival and COV live-streamers, Pain and Terror. During the rescue mission, Tannis reveals that she also has Siren powers, specifically to manipulate machines, which help turn the tide of the battle and she later explains that she inherited these powers from Angel after [[Borderlands 2|her death,]] a fact that both she and Lilith kept secret for her safety. Tannis warns the Vault Hunters that the Calypso Twins are preparing to open the Great Vault, being hidden on Pandora so they can drain the energy of the monster contained within it. The Vault Hunters and Crimson Raiders assault the COV's main headquarters to stop the opening of the Great Vault, but are too late to prevent Troy from activating the Great Vault Key, which is the entire moon of Elpis. The Vault Hunters fight Troy and kill him, resulting in Ava taking back and inheriting Maya's Siren powers that he had stolen. Unfortunately, the Great Vault starts opening and Tyreen absorbs Troy's energy before escaping. The Vault Hunters are then contacted by Typhon DeLeon, the first Vault Hunter, who warns them that the Great Vault contains an interdimensional monster called [[Borderlands (video game)|the Destroyer]], which has the power to devour stars and destroy the entire universe. He summons the Vault Hunters to the long lost Eridian homeworld, Nekrotafeyo.\n\nAt Nekrotafeyo, Typhon further explains that the Great Vault isn't simply located on Pandora, but is actually the entire planet of Pandora itself. The Eridians created the planet to act as a prison and sacrificed their entire civilization to lure and contain the Destroyer, but left behind the machine they used, in case the Destroyer escaped or was released. As they gather the four Vault Keys needed to power the device, Tyreen reveals that Typhon is in fact her and Troy's father. Typhon admits that he had tried to keep the twins with him on Nekrotafeyo to protect them, but it only made them bitter and power-hungry instead. Tyreen intervenes and disables the machine before it can be used and mortally wounds Typhon before fleeing back to Pandora. The Vault Hunters follow Tyreen just as she merges herself with the Destroyer and battles them. The Vault Hunters kill Tyreen and the Destroyer, and Lilith regains her Siren powers. However, Elpis still threatens to destroy Pandora as it continues to open the Great Vault. Lilith sacrifices herself to shut down Elpis, permanently leaving a flaming Firehawk sign branded on the moon.\n\nDuring the credits, scenes depict the Vault Hunters, the Crimson Raiders, and their allies honoring and memorializing Lilith, Tannis speculating her possible whereabouts, Rhys and Vaughn reuniting properly after years, Wainwright proposing to Hammerlock, Tina, Brick, and Mordecai playing ''Bunkers and Badasses'', and ending with a shot of everyone looking at the Firehawk sigil as a reminder of Lilith lighting the way for Vault Hunters and protecting Pandora forever.\n\n==Development==\n\n\n''Borderlands 3'' was developed jointly by Gearbox's Texas and Quebec studios. Gearbox had finished ''Borderlands'' and its sequel consecutively, leaving the studio somewhat burned out on the franchise. To try to do something different, Gearbox shifted work into ''[[Battleborn (video game)|Battleborn]]'' with the blessing of 2K Games, as a means of refreshing themselves. ''Battleborn'' was not a major success, but Gearbox was not disheartened on this. According to art director Scott Kester, while developing ''Battleborn'', they gained several ideas for how to take the next ''Borderlands'' game, and many of the team, as soon as ''Battleborn'' was complete, started building out these ideas for ''Borderlands 3''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/28/borderlands-3-preview-and-interview-were-here-to-make-a-borderlands-game-were-not-here-to-make-somebody-elses-game-10083552/ | title=  Borderlands 3 preview and interview \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re here to make a Borderlands game, we\u2019re not here to make somebody else\u2019s game\u2019 | date = 28 June 2019 | accessdate = 1 July 2019 | work = [[Metro (UK newspaper)|Metro]] }}</ref>\n\nGearbox Quebec undertook developing ''Borderlands 3'' as their first assignment, and said that they were doing so without compulsory overtime (\"[[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]]\").<ref>{{cite news |title=Borderlands 3 Created Completely Without \"Crunch\", Says Developer |url=https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-3-created-completely-without-crunch-says-developer/ |accessdate=6 June 2019 |work=TheGamer |date=5 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lavoie |first1=Rapha\u00ebl |title=Borderlands 3: Qu\u00e9bec crinquera le volume \u00e0 \"11\" |url=https://www.pesesurstart.com/2019/06/04/borderlands-3-quebec-crinquera-le-volume-a-11-dans-un-volet-joyeusement-demesure-entrevue |accessdate=6 June 2019 |work=P\u00e8se sur start |date=4 June 2019}}</ref> The game was announced with a trailer at [[PAX East]] on 28 March 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Delahunty-Light |first1=Zoe |title=The Borderlands 3 trailer is here and it\u2019s everything you wanted |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/borderlands-3-trailer/ |accessdate=28 March 2019 |work=Gamesradar+ |language=en}}</ref> The trailer received mixed reviews by video game websites, some of which characterized it as too similar in appearance and content to previous entries in the series such as ''[[Borderlands 2]]''.<ref name=gamespot29march2019>{{cite web|work=Gamespot|last1=Seipke|first1=Jean-Luc|last2=Ramee|first2=Jordan|date=29 March 2019|url=https://www.gamespot.com/videos/borderlands-3s-debut-trailer-didnt-impress-us-as-m/2300-6448973/|title=Borderlands 3's Debut Trailer Didn't Impress Us As Much As We Hoped}}</ref><ref name=polygon28march2019>{{cite web|work=Polygon|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/28/18285523/borderlands-3-trailer-reaction|date=28 March 2019|title=Borderlands 3\u2019s trailer is a disappointment|last=Kuchera|first=Ben}}</ref>\n\nTo help bridge the gap between ''Borderlands 2'' and ''Tales from the Borderlands'' to ''Borderlands 3'', Gearbox released new DLC for ''Borderlands 2'', \"Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary\", in June 2019, making it free for a limited time to current owners of ''Borderlands 2''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/commander-lilith-and-the-fight-for-sanctuary-is-a-new-borderlands-2-dlc-and-you-can-get-it-free/ | title = Commander Lilith & the Fight for Sanctuary is a new Borderlands 2 DLC and you can get it free | first = Jody | last =MacGregor | date = 8 June 2019 | accessdate = 1 July 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nSeveral voice actors reprised their roles, including [[Ashly Burch]] as Tiny Tina,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/14/18310466/borderlands-3-voice-actors-tiny-tina-ashly-burch-ps4-xbox-one-pc | title = Borderlands 3 brings back Ashly Burch in her first big role | first=  Owen | last = Good  |date = 14 April 2019 | accessdate = 14 April 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref> and [[Chris Hardwick]] as Vaughn from ''Tales from the Borderlands''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652758/gearbox-chris-hardwick-reprise-former-role-borderlands-3-confirmation | title = Gearbox confirms Chris Hardwick will reprise former role for Borderlands 3 | first = Megan | last = Farokhmanesh | date = 5 June 2019 | accessdate = 5 June 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref> The recasting of other voice actors caused some controversy.

However, it was felt that the flow of ''Borderlands 3'' was still disrupted by the franchise's reliance on boss fights with little strategy and \"bullet sponge\" enemies.

It took place at the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|RKO Pantages Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], and the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]] in New York City.\n\nThe second national telecast of the Awards show drew an estimated 43 million viewers. [[Shirley Booth]], appearing in a play in Philadelphia, presented the Best Actor award through a live broadcast cut-in, and privately received the winner's name over the telephone from co-host [[Donald O'Connor]]. (Actor [[Fredric March]] co-hosted from New York City.) [[Gary Cooper]] filmed his presentation of the Best Actress award in advance on a set in Mexico, with O'Connor announcing the winner's name.\n\nAll the major winners in this year were black-and-white films. The big winner was [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with 13 nominations and eight awards including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay ([[Daniel Taradash]]), Best Cinematography (Burnett Guffey), Best Sound, and Best Film Editing. All five of its major actors and actresses were nominated, with secondary players [[Donna Reed]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] taking home Oscars. The film was based on [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]]' controversial, best-selling novel about Army life on a Hawaiian (Oahu) military base just before the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack and World War II, illustrating the conflict between an individualistic private ([[Montgomery Clift]]) and rigid institutional authority (exemplified by the Army). Its achievement of eight awards matched the then record held by ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939). The record was tied again the following year by ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954). [[Walt Disney]] won four awards, which set the record for the most Oscars won in the same year.\n\n[[William Holden]]'s speech for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Stalag 17]]'' was simply \"Thank You\", making it one of the shortest speeches ever; the TV broadcast had a strict cutoff time which forced Holden's quick remarks. The frustrated Holden personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he wanted to on Oscar night. He also remarked that he felt that either [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Montgomery Clift]] should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' instead of him.\n\n==Awards==\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in '''boldface.'''<ref name=\"Oscars1954\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1954 |title=The 26th Academy Awards (1954) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=May 31, 2015 |publisher=Oscars.org ([[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093858/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/26th-winners.html |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Fred Zinnemann 1940s.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Fred Zinnemann]]; Best Director winner|alt=Fred Zinnemann 1940s.jpg]]\n[[File:WILLIAMHolden.jpg|thumb|150px|[[William Holden]]; Best Actor winner|alt=WILLIAMHolden.jpg]]\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn 1956.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Audrey Hepburn]]; Best Actress winner|alt=Audrey Hepburn 1956.jpg]]\n[[File:Frank Sinatra '57.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Frank Sinatra]]; Best Supporting Actor winner|alt=Frank Sinatra '57.jpg]]\n[[File:DOnnaREed.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Donna Reed]]; Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n[[File:Charles Brackett.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Brackett]]; Best Story and Screenplay co-winner|alt=Charles Brackett.jpg]]\n[[File:Trumbo 1947.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Dalton Trumbo]]; Best Story winner|alt=Trumbo at the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings in 1947]]\n[[File:Walt Disney 1946.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Walt Disney]]; Best Animated Short Film, Best Documentary Feature, Best Documentary Short Subject and Best Live Action Short Subject, Two-Reel winner|alt=Walt Disney 1946.JPG]]\n[[File:Cedric-Gibbons-1936.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cedric Gibbons]]; Best Art Direction, Black-and-White co-winner|alt=Cedric-Gibbons-1936.jpg]]\n[[File:Charles LeMaire.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles LeMaire]]; Best Costume Design, Color winner|alt=Charles LeMaire.jpg]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Motion Picture]]\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''''[[From Here to Eternity]] \u2013 ''[[Buddy Adler]] for [[Columbia Pictures]]&nbsp;'''{{double dagger}}\n**''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]] \u2013 ''[[John Houseman]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]&nbsp; \n**''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]] \u2013 ''[[Frank Ross (producer)|Frank Ross]] for [[20th Century Fox]]&nbsp; \n**''[[Roman Holiday]] \u2013 ''[[William Wyler]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]&nbsp; \n**''[[Shane (film)|Shane]] \u2013 ''[[George Stevens]] for Paramount Pictures&nbsp; \n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''[[Fred Zinnemann]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'''''{{double dagger}}\n**[[Charles Walters]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Lili]]''\n**[[William Wyler]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Roman Holiday]]''\n**[[George Stevens]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]''\n**[[Billy Wilder]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Stalag 17]]''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" |  [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" |  [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''[[William Holden]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Stalag 17]]'' as J.

It took place at the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|RKO Pantages Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], and the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]] in New York City.\n\nThe second national telecast of the Awards show drew an estimated 43 million viewers. [[Shirley Booth]], appearing in a play in Philadelphia, presented the Best Actor award through a live broadcast cut-in, and privately received the winner's name over the telephone from co-host [[Donald O'Connor]]. (Actor [[Fredric March]] co-hosted from New York City.) [[Gary Cooper]] filmed his presentation of the Best Actress award in advance on a set in Mexico, with O'Connor announcing the winner's name.\n\nAll the major winners in this year were black-and-white films. The big winner was [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with 13 nominations and eight awards including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay ([[Daniel Taradash]]), Best Cinematography (Burnett Guffey), Best Sound, and Best Film Editing. All five of its major actors and actresses were nominated, with secondary players [[Donna Reed]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] taking home Oscars. The film was based on [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]]' controversial, best-selling novel about Army life on a Hawaiian (Oahu) military base just before the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack and World War II, illustrating the conflict between an individualistic private ([[Montgomery Clift]]) and rigid institutional authority (exemplified by the Army). Its achievement of eight awards matched the then record held by ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939). The record was tied again the following year by ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954). [[Walt Disney]] won four awards, which set the record for the most Oscars won in the same year.\n\n[[William Holden]]'s speech for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Stalag 17]]'' was simply \"Thank You\", making it one of the shortest speeches ever; the TV broadcast had a strict cutoff time which forced Holden's quick remarks. The frustrated Holden personally paid for advertisements in the Hollywood trade publications to thank everyone he wanted to on Oscar night. He also remarked that he felt that either [[Burt Lancaster]] or [[Montgomery Clift]] should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' instead of him.\n\n==Awards==\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in '''boldface.'''<ref name=\"Oscars1954\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1954 |title=The 26th Academy Awards (1954) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=May 31, 2015 |publisher=Oscars.org ([[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706093858/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/26th-winners.html |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Fred Zinnemann 1940s.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Fred Zinnemann]]; Best Director winner|alt=Fred Zinnemann 1940s.jpg]]\n[[File:WILLIAMHolden.jpg|thumb|150px|[[William Holden]]; Best Actor winner|alt=WILLIAMHolden.jpg]]\n[[File:Audrey Hepburn 1956.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Audrey Hepburn]]; Best Actress winner|alt=Audrey Hepburn 1956.jpg]]\n[[File:Frank Sinatra '57.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Frank Sinatra]]; Best Supporting Actor winner|alt=Frank Sinatra '57.jpg]]\n[[File:DOnnaREed.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Donna Reed]]; Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n[[File:Charles Brackett.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Brackett]]; Best Story and Screenplay co-winner|alt=Charles Brackett.jpg]]\n[[File:Trumbo 1947.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Dalton Trumbo]]; Best Story winner|alt=Trumbo at the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings in 1947]]\n[[File:Walt Disney 1946.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Walt Disney]]; Best Animated Short Film, Best Documentary Feature, Best Documentary Short Subject and Best Live Action Short Subject, Two-Reel winner|alt=Walt Disney 1946.JPG]]\n[[File:Cedric-Gibbons-1936.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cedric Gibbons]]; Best Art Direction, Black-and-White co-winner|alt=Cedric-Gibbons-1936.jpg]]\n[[File:Charles LeMaire.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles LeMaire]]; Best Costume Design, Color winner|alt=Charles LeMaire.jpg]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Motion Picture]]\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''''[[From Here to Eternity]] \u2013 ''[[Buddy Adler]] for [[Columbia Pictures]]&nbsp;'''{{double dagger}}\n**''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]] \u2013 ''[[John Houseman]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]&nbsp; \n**''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]] \u2013 ''[[Frank Ross (producer)|Frank Ross]] for [[20th Century Fox]]&nbsp; \n**''[[Roman Holiday]] \u2013 ''[[William Wyler]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]&nbsp; \n**''[[Shane (film)|Shane]] \u2013 ''[[George Stevens]] for Paramount Pictures&nbsp; \n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''[[Fred Zinnemann]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'''''{{double dagger}}\n**[[Charles Walters]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Lili]]''\n**[[William Wyler]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Roman Holiday]]''\n**[[George Stevens]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]''\n**[[Billy Wilder]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Stalag 17]]''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" |  [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" |  [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''[[William Holden]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Stalag 17]]'' as J.

However, there are also numerous projects aimed at providing only a certain script, such as the [[Arabeyes]] Arabic font. The advantage of targeting only some scripts with a [[font]] was that certain Unicode characters should be rendered differently depending on which language they are used in, and that a font that only includes the characters a certain user needs will be much smaller in file size compared to one with many glyphs. Unicode fonts in modern formats such as [[OpenType]] can in theory cover multiple languages by including multiple glyphs per character, though very few actually cover more than one language's forms of the [[Han unification|unified Han characters]].\n==History==\n===GNU Unifont===\n{{Main|GNU Unifont}}\n'''[[GNU Unifont]]''' is a [[bitmap]]-based font created by Roman Czyborra that is  present in most free [[operating system]]s and windowing systems such as [[Linux]], [[XFree86]] or the [[X.Org Server]].

The project was started by Primo\u017e Peterlin and is currently administered by Steve White.  The aim of this project has been to produce a package of fonts by collecting existing free fonts and special donations, to support as many Unicode characters as possible. The font family is released as '''GNU FreeFont''' under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It also supports several font formats, including [[PostScript]], [[TrueType]], and [[OpenType]]. For this reason the fonts are derived from original work made in [[FontForge]], and stored in .sfd (Spline Font Database) files. The most recent release is from May 2012.\n\n====SIL fonts====\n[[SIL International]] offers a large number of fonts, editors, translation and book production systems<ref>[http://scripts.sil.org/default NRSI: Computers and Writing Systems]</ref> as part of their goal to bridge the [[digital divide]] to minority languages. This site contains many utilities for Windows systems, including right-to-left editors, keymappers, RTF translators, and high-quality, free Unicode fonts.\nSIL publish their fonts under their own [[SIL Open Font License]]. Typefaces include [[Charis SIL]], [[Doulos SIL]] and [[Gentium]].\n\n====MPH 2B Damase====\nMark Williamson's MPH 2B Damase is a free font encoding many non-Latin scripts, including the Unicode 4.1 scripts in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]:\n[[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], Cherokee, Coptic, [[Cypriot Syllabary]], [[Cyrillic]], Deseret, Georgian, [[Glagolitic]], Gothic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Limbu, [[Linear B]] (partial coverage), Old Italic, [[Old Persian cuneiform]], [[Osmanya]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Shavian]], [[Syloti Nagri]] (no conjuncts), [[Tai Le (Unicode block)|Tai Le]] (no combining tone marks), [[Thaana]], [[Tifinagh]], [[Ugaritic]], and [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]].<ref>[http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/views/View_MPH2BDamase.html Details for MPH 2B Damase]</ref>\n\n====IndUni fonts====\nThe IndUni fonts are a GPL-licensed font family with many accents and combining characters, especially suitable for Indic, Indian and Nepali (Sanskrit, Prakrit, Hindi) and Middle Eastern languages and Urdu in transliteration. It also includes characters for Avestan and for the Pinyin representation of Chinese, a set of Cyrillic characters and a basic set of Greek letters. The fonts implement almost the whole of the Multilingual European Subset 1 of Unicode. Also provided are keyboard handlers for Windows and the Mac, making input easy.\n\nThey are based on fonts designed by [[URW++]] Design and Development Incorporated, and offer lookalikes for [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]], [[Helvetica]], [[Times Roman|Times]], [[Palatino]], and [[New Century Schoolbook]].<ref>[http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/ IndUni fonts, by John Smith]</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n==== Noto fonts ====\n{{main|Noto fonts}}\nNoto is a font family designed to cover all the scripts encoded in the [[Unicode]] standard.

Unicode fonts in modern formats such as [[OpenType]] can in theory cover multiple languages by including multiple glyphs per character, though very few actually cover more than one language's forms of the [[Han unification|unified Han characters]].\n==History==\n===GNU Unifont===\n{{Main|GNU Unifont}}\n'''[[GNU Unifont]]''' is a [[bitmap]]-based font created by Roman Czyborra that is  present in most free [[operating system]]s and windowing systems such as [[Linux]], [[XFree86]] or the [[X.Org Server]]. The font is released under the [[GNU General Public License]] Version 2+ with a font embedding exception.\n\n===Fixed===\n{{Main|Fixed (typeface)}}\nThe [[Fixed (typeface)|Fixed]] X11 public-domain core bitmap fonts have provided substantial Unicode coverage since 1997.\n\n==21st Century==\n===2000s===\n====Free UCS Outline Fonts====\n{{Main|Free UCS Outline Fonts}}\nThe '''Free UCS Outline Fonts''' <ref>[http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/ Free UCS Outline Fonts]</ref> (also known as '''freefont''') is a font collection project. The project was started by Primo\u017e Peterlin and is currently administered by Steve White.  The aim of this project has been to produce a package of fonts by collecting existing free fonts and special donations, to support as many Unicode characters as possible. The font family is released as '''GNU FreeFont''' under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It also supports several font formats, including [[PostScript]], [[TrueType]], and [[OpenType]]. For this reason the fonts are derived from original work made in [[FontForge]], and stored in .sfd (Spline Font Database) files. The most recent release is from May 2012.\n\n====SIL fonts====\n[[SIL International]] offers a large number of fonts, editors, translation and book production systems<ref>[http://scripts.sil.org/default NRSI: Computers and Writing Systems]</ref> as part of their goal to bridge the [[digital divide]] to minority languages. This site contains many utilities for Windows systems, including right-to-left editors, keymappers, RTF translators, and high-quality, free Unicode fonts.\nSIL publish their fonts under their own [[SIL Open Font License]]. Typefaces include [[Charis SIL]], [[Doulos SIL]] and [[Gentium]].\n\n====MPH 2B Damase====\nMark Williamson's MPH 2B Damase is a free font encoding many non-Latin scripts, including the Unicode 4.1 scripts in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]:\n[[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], Cherokee, Coptic, [[Cypriot Syllabary]], [[Cyrillic]], Deseret, Georgian, [[Glagolitic]], Gothic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Limbu, [[Linear B]] (partial coverage), Old Italic, [[Old Persian cuneiform]], [[Osmanya]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Shavian]], [[Syloti Nagri]] (no conjuncts), [[Tai Le (Unicode block)|Tai Le]] (no combining tone marks), [[Thaana]], [[Tifinagh]], [[Ugaritic]], and [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]].<ref>[http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/views/View_MPH2BDamase.html Details for MPH 2B Damase]</ref>\n\n====IndUni fonts====\nThe IndUni fonts are a GPL-licensed font family with many accents and combining characters, especially suitable for Indic, Indian and Nepali (Sanskrit, Prakrit, Hindi) and Middle Eastern languages and Urdu in transliteration. It also includes characters for Avestan and for the Pinyin representation of Chinese, a set of Cyrillic characters and a basic set of Greek letters. The fonts implement almost the whole of the Multilingual European Subset 1 of Unicode. Also provided are keyboard handlers for Windows and the Mac, making input easy.\n\nThey are based on fonts designed by [[URW++]] Design and Development Incorporated, and offer lookalikes for [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]], [[Helvetica]], [[Times Roman|Times]], [[Palatino]], and [[New Century Schoolbook]].<ref>[http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/ IndUni fonts, by John Smith]</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n==== Noto fonts ====\n{{main|Noto fonts}}\nNoto is a font family designed to cover all the scripts encoded in the [[Unicode]] standard. It is designed with the goal of achieving visual harmony (e.g., compatible heights and stroke thicknesses) across multiple languages/scripts.
