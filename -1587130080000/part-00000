{"title_page": "Whitin Machine Works", "text_new": "[[Image:Whitinsville Shop.jpg|thumb|right|Whitin Machine Works, 2005]]\nThe '''Whitin Machine Works''' (WMW) was founded by [[Paul Whitin]] and his sons in 1831 on the banks of the [[Mumford River]] in South [[Northbridge, Massachusetts]]. The village of South Northbridge became known as [[Whitinsville]] in 1835, in honor of its founder.\n\nThe WMW became one of the largest textile machinery companies in the world.  Known as The \"Shop\" to locals, would operate well into the 20th century, long after many of the [[New England]] mills had moved South. By 1948,  The company was operating at peak capacity, employing 5,615 men and women. The Shop was the center of life in the village of [[Whitinsville, Massachusetts]] for over 135 years, until 1976.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Brick Mill Forge.jpg|thumb|1826 Brick Mill and Fletcher's Forge, Whitinsville, Massachusetts]]\nIn 1809, Paul Whitin and his father-in-law James Fletcher and others from [[Northbridge, Massachusetts|Northbridge]] and [[Leicester, Massachusetts|Leicester]], established the '''Northbridge Cotton Manufacturing Company'''. This wood-framed spinning mill, two and one-half stories high had 200 spindles and was only the third cotton mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] at the time.\n\nIn 1815, Paul Whitin became a partner with Fletcher, and his two brothers-in-law, Samuel and Ezra Fletcher, under the firm name of '''Whitin and Fletcher'''. Then they built a second mill with 300 spindles on the opposite side of the [[Mumford River]]. Paul Whitin then bought out the Fletcher shares in 1826 and formed a new partnership with his two sons, Paul Jr. and John Crane Whitin. The new company was called '''Paul Whitin and Sons'''.<ref>[http://www.blackstonedaily.com/whitingeneology.htm Whitin Genealogy by Don Gosselin]</ref>  Also in 1826, a new brick mill was constructed, having 2000 spindles, which still stands today at [[Whitinsville]], having been recently restored. \n\nThe 1826 brick mill is perhaps the oldest surviving, unaltered [[textile mill]] remaining in Massachusetts. Colonel Fletcher's 1772 Blacksmith Forge is also still standing, next to the Brick Mill, on the west bank of the [[Mumford River]].\n\nLater on, Paul Whitin's two other younger sons, Charles P. and James F. later also entered into the family-run business.\n\nWhitin died in 1831. Years later, with the cotton business on a solid basis and escalating in 1845, Betsey Whitin and her sons built a new, stone textile factory, largely of granite known as the '''Whitinsville Cotton Mill''', which gave the family business 7,500 more spindles. The Whitinsville Cotton Mill would later be used as a testing facility for new equipment developed by the Whitin Machine Works, across the street. This is now called the restored Cotton Mill Apartments, in [[Whitinsville]].\n\n==Whitinsville: a company town==\n[[Image:Whitin Frame.jpg|thumb|A Whitin Spinning Frame]]\nIn 1831, [[Paul Whitin]]'s third son John Crane Whitin designed and had patented a new cotton picker machine that outperformed others in the previous mills. This was to be first of other successive inventions that would establish the Whitin Machine Works as a great textile machinery company.\n\nIn 1847, the Whitins built \"The Shop,\" which consisted of a new textile production area that was four times larger than the brick mill. It contained machine shops, foundries, and other specialized structures.\n\nAs the family textile businesses expanded, so did the village of [[Whitinsville]]. More housing was provided by the company for new workers on North Main St. and on other side streets as [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] workers poured into the labor pool that same year (1847). Just seven years prior, John C. Whitin had developed the first of stately mansions, which had occupied land where the Whitin Gymnasium now stands. During this time also, Paul Whitin Jr. had married Sarah Chapin and built a new Italian-styled home, along with his brother in 1856.\n\nLife in the village revolved around \"the shop,\" providing the means and the opportunity for successive generations of mostly Europeans to immigrate. The Whitin's built the entire village to support their expanding business operations. In all the company would erect 1,000 buildings (2200 units) to house their growing workforce. The work was hard and often dangerous. There were recorded incidents where workers lost their lives working in the shop foundry or the machine shop. But working and living in [[Whitinsville]] was much better than the average mill town. \"The company\" provided amenities unheard of in neighboring villages; such as heating coal at company cost, free snowplowing, landscaping and property maintenance. The Whitin's allowed any employee who heated their homes with wood access to their properties to cut down as many trees as needed, free of charge. The company constructed the first reservoir, creating meadow pond, (west of Main St.) which was the first system that pumped water directly into village homes. A typical sight on weekends would be the villager's sailing and fishing on the pond using equipment rented from the company provided facility. Through the 1860s the work schedule was 11 hours (7am-6pm) per day and 6 days per week. And yet, there was a long-standing tradition of allowing up to 4 unpaid personal days off per month. It is well known, for instance, that during slow times in the shop, John C. would hire idle employees to work on his property, farms, or, as in 1879, build the Town Hall as a memorial to his late father and mother. As the fortunes of the company grew, so would its generosity to the town. Many public buildings still in use today were built with Whitin funds and then donated to the town; the Whitin Community Center being a prime example.  \n\nThe Whitin family continued to hold the Whitin Machine Works privately until 1946. By 1948, the company was operating at peak capacity, employing 5,615 men and women. Its products were sold worldwide. However, the business declined over the next two decades. In 1966, Whitin Machine Works was sold to [[White Consolidated Industries]].

He reported discovering a body of water, a [[strait]] which today bears his name: the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], which today forms part of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]].\n\nAbout 500 Greeks from [[Smyrna]], [[Crete]], and [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] settled in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]] in 1768. The colony was unsuccessful, and the settlers moved to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in 1776.

By 1890, there were almost 15,000 Greeks living in the U.S.\n\nImmigration picked up again in the 1890s and early 20th century, due largely to economic opportunity in the U.S., displacement caused by the hardships of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the [[Balkan Wars]], and [[World War I]].

Each wave of immigration contributed to the growth of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] in the U.S.\n\nGreek immigration at this time was over 90% male, contrasted with most other European immigration to the U.S., such as [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigration, which averaged 50% to 60% male. Many Greek immigrants expected to work and return to their [[homeland]] after earning capital and dowries for their families. However, the loss of their homeland due to the [[Greek Genocide]] and the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], which displaced 1,500,000 Greeks from [[Anatolia]], [[Eastern Thrace]], and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] caused the initial economic immigrants to reside permanently in America. The Greeks were [[de jure]] denaturalized from their homelands and lost the right to return, and their families were made refugees. Additionally, the first widely implemented [[Immigration Act of 1924|U.S. immigration limits against non Western European immigrants]] were made in 1924, creating an impetus for immigrants to apply for citizenship, bring their families and permanently settle in the U.S. Fewer than 30,000 Greek immigrants arrived in the U.S. between 1925 and 1945, most of whom were \"[[Mail-order bride|picture brides]]\" for single Greek men and family members coming over to join relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpa.gr/specials/us_hellenes/micra_asia.html|script-title=el:\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7 \u039c. \u0391\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u0397\u03a0\u0391|trans-title=Persecuted Greeks from Asia Minor in the USA|language=el|publisher=mpa.gr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040807140929/http://www.mpa.gr/specials/us_hellenes/micra_asia.html|archivedate=August 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Frangos|url=http://www.pahh.com/frangos/brides.html|title=Picture Bride Era in Greek American History|publisher=The National Herald|via=Preservation of American Hellenic History|date=March 12, 2005|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Sponge auction in Tarpon Springs (9190026157).jpg|thumb|220px|Sponge auction in [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]] in 1947.

Greeks again began to arrive in large numbers after 1945, fleeing the economic devastation caused by [[World War II]] and the [[Greek Civil War]]. From 1945 until 1982, approximately 211,000 Greeks emigrated to the United States. These later immigrants were less influenced by the powerful assimilation pressures of the 1920s and 1930s and revitalized Greek American identity, especially in areas such as Greek-language media.\n\nGreek immigrants founded more than 600 [[diner]]s in the New York metropolitan area in the 1950s through the 1970s.

By 1890, there were almost 15,000 Greeks living in the U.S.\n\nImmigration picked up again in the 1890s and early 20th century, due largely to economic opportunity in the U.S., displacement caused by the hardships of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the [[Balkan Wars]], and [[World War I]].

Each wave of immigration contributed to the growth of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]] in the U.S.\n\nGreek immigration at this time was over 90% male, contrasted with most other European immigration to the U.S., such as [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigration, which averaged 50% to 60% male. Many Greek immigrants expected to work and return to their [[homeland]] after earning capital and dowries for their families. However, the loss of their homeland due to the [[Greek Genocide]] and the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], which displaced 1,500,000 Greeks from [[Anatolia]], [[Eastern Thrace]], and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] caused the initial economic immigrants to reside permanently in America. The Greeks were [[de jure]] denaturalized from their homelands and lost the right to return, and their families were made refugees. Additionally, the first widely implemented [[Immigration Act of 1924|U.S. immigration limits against non Western European immigrants]] were made in 1924, creating an impetus for immigrants to apply for citizenship, bring their families and permanently settle in the U.S. Fewer than 30,000 Greek immigrants arrived in the U.S. between 1925 and 1945, most of whom were \"[[Mail-order bride|picture brides]]\" for single Greek men and family members coming over to join relatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpa.gr/specials/us_hellenes/micra_asia.html|script-title=el:\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7 \u039c. \u0391\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u0397\u03a0\u0391|trans-title=Persecuted Greeks from Asia Minor in the USA|language=el|publisher=mpa.gr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040807140929/http://www.mpa.gr/specials/us_hellenes/micra_asia.html|archivedate=August 7, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Frangos|url=http://www.pahh.com/frangos/brides.html|title=Picture Bride Era in Greek American History|publisher=The National Herald|via=Preservation of American Hellenic History|date=March 12, 2005|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Sponge auction in Tarpon Springs (9190026157).jpg|thumb|220px|Sponge auction in [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]] in 1947.

Greeks again began to arrive in large numbers after 1945, fleeing the economic devastation caused by [[World War II]] and the [[Greek Civil War]]. From 1945 until 1982, approximately 211,000 Greeks emigrated to the United States. These later immigrants were less influenced by the powerful assimilation pressures of the 1920s and 1930s and revitalized Greek American identity, especially in areas such as Greek-language media.\n\nGreek immigrants founded more than 600 [[diner]]s in the New York metropolitan area in the 1950s through the 1970s.

Its fleet is made up of an assortment of [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]] aircraft, including: [[Boeing 737]]s, [[Boeing 777|777]]s, [[Boeing 747|747]]s, [[Boeing 787|787]]s along with [[Airbus A319]]s, [[Airbus A320|A320]]s, [[Airbus A321|A321]]s and [[Airbus A330|A330]]s. Air China also operates a second hub in [[Chengdu International Airport]], where it primarily flies domestic routes, as well as [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]], where many international routes served.\n\n==Destinations==\n{{Main|List of Air China destinations}}\n[[File:AirChinaDestinations.svg|thumb|{{legend|red|Mainland China}}\n{{legend|blue|Destinations}}\n{{legend|#dfd|Seasonal}}\n{{legend|#FFFF80|Future}}\n{{legend|grey|Terminated}}]]\n\nAir China's route network extends throughout [[Asia]] to the [[Middle East]], [[Western Europe]], and [[North America]] from its hubs at [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] and [[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/52606-hainan-airlines-set-to-establish-chengdu-base | title=Hainan Airlines set to establish Chengdu base | work=[[ch-aviation]] | date=22 January 2017 | accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> It also currently reaches a significant number of Asian, Australian and European destinations from [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai]]. Some international routes operate from [[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport|Chengdu]], [[Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport|Chongqing]], [[Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport|Dalian]], [[Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport|Hangzhou]], [[Kunming Changshui International Airport|Kunming]] and [[Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport|Xiamen]]. It is one of the few world airlines that fly to all six habitable continents.\n\nOn 10 December 2006, Air China began serving its first [[South America]]n destination, [[Guarulhos International Airport|S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos]] (via [[Madrid Barajas Airport|Madrid-Barajas]]). This was the airline's longest direct flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seatmaestro.com/airlines-seating-maps/air-china/history/|title=History of Air China|website=SeatMaestro|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> The service was initiated with a [[Boeing 767-300ER]], but due to increased demand, the service has been upgraded to an [[Airbus A330-200]], and later a [[Boeing 787-9]].\n\nRegular flights between [[mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] started in July 2009. Due to the [[political status of Taiwan]], all Air China airframes that operate flights to and from Taiwan are required to cover the [[flag of the People's Republic of China]] on the fuselage.\n\nAir China introduced its new Airbus A330-300 to long-haul operations beginning with services to [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], Germany in summer 2011. These aircraft provided the same two-class cabin standard as the Airbus A330-200 except that the economy cabin had no seat-back entertainment system installed (with the exception of the first two economy rows which also had increased legroom). D\u00fcsseldorf is now the third German destination on the Air China network. The airline launched a new Beijing-[[Milan Malpensa Airport|Milan-Malpensa]] service on 15 June 2011, complementing the airline's existing service to Milan from Shanghai.\n\nDeliveries of the carrier's 19 new [[Boeing 777-300ER]]s commenced in mid-2011, with the aircraft forming the new \"backbone of its future longhaul operations.\" The new Boeing 777-300ERs replaced the [[Boeing 747-400]]s on routes to U.S. destinations such as [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[San Francisco]], but was expected to first enter service on flights to Paris from March 2012. The Boeing 777-300ER began to replace most 747 service once sufficient numbers entered the fleet.<ref>{{cite

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any outside government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain.<ref>Lepore (1998), ''The Name of War'' (1999) pp 5-7</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Plymouth Colony]] was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Indians, particularly [[Squanto]] and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors. A jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder, and they were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 [[Julian calendar|(O.S.)]], at Plymouth.\n\n==Southern theater, 1675==\n\n=== Raid on Swansea ===\nA band of [[Pokanoket]]s attacked several isolated homesteads in the small Plymouth colony settlement of [[Swansea, Massachusetts|Swansea]] on June 20, 1675.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5m90c088;view=1up;seq=78| title=The History of King Philip's War| author=Church, Benjamin (1639-1718)| publisher=HathiTrust| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign. The nearby towns in Rhode Island provided care for the wounded until they could return to their homes.<ref>Leach (1954), ''Flintlock and Tomahawk'', pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n=== Mohawk intervention ===\nIn December 1675, Metacomet established a winter camp in [[Schaghticoke (village), New York|Schaghticoke]], New York.<ref name=\"eric17\">{{cite book|last1=Tougias|first1=Michael|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|date=2017|publisher=Countryman Press|isbn=1581574908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I422DAAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref> His reason for moving into New York has been attributed to a desire to enlist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] aid in the conflict.<ref name=\"drake\">{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=James|title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676|date=1999|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1558492240|page=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/122 122]|url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration}}</ref> Though New York was a non-belligerent, Governor [[Edmund Andros]] was nonetheless concerned at the arrival of the Wampanoag sachem.<ref name=\"eric17\"/> Either with Andros' sanction, or of their own accord, the Mohawk\u2014traditional rivals of the Algonquian people\u2014launched a surprise assault against a 500-warrior band under Metacomet's command the following February.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref name=\"drake\"/> The \"ruthless\" ''[[coup de main]]'' resulted in the death of between 70 and as many as 460 of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"barr\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/> His forces crippled, Metacomet withdrew to New England, pursued \"relentlessly\" by Mohawk forces who attacked Algonquian settlements and ambushed their supply parties.<ref name=\"eric17\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Calloway|first1=Colin|title=After King Philip's War: Presence and Persistence in Indian New England|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=1611680611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXrgK29zl2QC&dq}}</ref><ref name=\"barr\">{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Daniel|title=Unconquered: The Iroquois League at War in Colonial America|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275984664|page=[https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73 73]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/unconquerediroqu00barr_0/page/73}}</ref>\n\nOver the next several months, fear of Mohawk attack led some Wampanoag to surrender to the colonists, and one historian described the decision of the Mohawk to engage Metacomet's forces as \"the blow that lost the war for Philip\".<ref name=\"drake\"/><ref name=\"eric17\"/>\n\n===Indian campaign===\nIndians attacked and destroyed more settlements throughout the winter of 1675\u201376 in their effort to annihilate the colonists.

Philip led a force of 1,500 [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] Indians in a dawn attack on the isolated village, which then included all or part of the neighboring modern communities of [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] and [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences. Many of the community's other houses were destroyed before the Indians retreated northward.\n\n=== Plymouth Plantation Campaign ===\n[[File:Site of Nine Men's Misery (Cumberland, Rhode Island).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Site of \"[[Nine Men's Misery]]\" in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]] where Captain Pierce's troops were tortured]]\nThe spring of 1676 marked the high point for the combined tribes when they attacked Plymouth Plantation on March 12.

They attacked three more settlements; [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]] (near Springfield), Marlborough, and Simsbury were attacked two weeks later. They killed Captain Pierce<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53528344| title=Capt Michael Pierce's Defeat (1615 - 1676) - Find a Grave Memorial| publisher=| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> and a company of Massachusetts soldiers between Pawtucket and the Blackstone's settlement. Several colonial men were tortured and buried at [[Nine Men's Misery]] in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]] as part of the Indians' ritual torture of enemies. They also burned the settlement of Providence to the ground on March 29. At the same time, a small band of Indians infiltrated and burned part of Springfield while the militia was away.\n\n[[File:Early American Conflict.jpg|thumb|right|Colonists defending their settlement (non-contemporary depiction)]]\nThe settlements within the modern-day [[State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|state of Rhode Island]] became a literal island colony for a time as the settlements at [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] were sacked and burned, and the residents were driven to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]].

The small towns of [[Northfield, Massachusetts|Northfield]], [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], and several others were abandoned as the surviving settlers retreated to the larger towns. The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period.

He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]].

Metacom ({{circa}}&nbsp;1638\u20131676) was his younger son, and he became tribal chief in 1662 after Massasoit's death. Metacom, however, did not maintain his father's alliance between the Wampanoags and the colonists. The colonists insisted that the peace agreement in 1671 should include the surrender of Indian guns; then three Wampanoags were hanged for murder in [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1675 which increased the tensions. Indian raiding parties attacked homesteads and villages throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine over the next six months, and the Colonial militia retaliated. The [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] remained neutral, but several individual Narragansetts participated in raids of colonial strongholds and militia, so colonial leaders deemed them to be in violation of peace treaties. The colonies assembled the largest army that New England had yet mustered, consisting of 1,000 militia and 150 Indian allies, and Governor Josiah Winslow marshaled them to attack the Narragansetts in November 1675. They attacked and burned Indian villages throughout Rhode Island territory, culminating with the attack on the Narragansetts' main fort in the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. An estimated 600 Narragansetts were killed, many of them women and children, and the Indian coalition was then taken over by Narragansett sachem Canonchet. They pushed back the colonial frontier in Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, and Rhode Island colonies, burning towns as they went, including [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] in March 1676. However, the colonial militia overwhelmed the Indian coalition and, by the end of the war, the Wampanoags and their Narragansett allies were almost completely destroyed.<ref>{{Britannica| url=https://www.britannica.com/event/King-Philips-War| title=King Philip's War BRITISH-NATIVE AMERICAN CONFLICT| last=Warren| first=Jason W.| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref> On August 12, 1676, Metacom fled to Mount Hope where he was killed by the militia.\n\nThe war was the greatest calamity in seventeenth-century New England and is considered by many to be the deadliest war in Colonial American history.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\">{{cite book |last=Drake |first=James David |date=1999 |title=King Philip's War: Civil War in New England, 1675-1676 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=The University of Massachusetts Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingphilipswarci00/page/1 1\u201315] |isbn=1558492240 }}</ref> In the space of little more than a year, 12 of the region's towns were destroyed and many more were damaged, the economy of Plymouth and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] Colonies was all but ruined and their population was decimated, losing one-tenth of all men available for military service.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\">{{cite journal| first=Philip| last=Gould| title=Reinventing Benjamin Church: Virtue, Citizenship and the History of King Philip's War in Early National America| work=Journal of the Early Republic| volume=16| date=Winter 1996|doi=10.2307/3124421}}</ref>{{rp|656}}<ref>{{cite book| last=Schultz| first=Eric B.| author2=Michael J.

The New England colonists faced their enemies without support from any outside government or military, and this began to give them a group identity separate and distinct from Britain.<ref>Lepore (1998), ''The Name of War'' (1999) pp 5-7</ref>\n\n==Historical context==\n[[Plymouth Colony]] was established in 1620 with significant early help from local Indians, particularly [[Squanto]] and Massasoit. Subsequent colonists founded [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Boston]], and many small towns around Massachusetts Bay between 1628 and 1640, during a time of increased English immigration. The colonists progressively expanded throughout the territories of the several [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes in the region. Prior to King Philip's War, tensions fluctuated between Indian tribes and the colonists, but relations were generally peaceful.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\nThe [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] colonies each developed separate relations with the [[Wampanoag]]s, [[Nipmuc]]ks, [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], [[Pequots]], and other tribes of New England, whose territories historically had differing boundaries. Many of the neighboring tribes had been traditional competitors and enemies. As the colonial population increased, the New Englanders expanded their settlements along the region's coastal plain and up the [[Connecticut River]] valley. By 1675, they had established a few small towns in the interior between Boston and the Connecticut River settlements.\n\nThe [[Wampanoag]] tribe under Metacomet's leadership had entered into an agreement with the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection. However, in the decades preceding the war, it became clear to them that the treaty did not mean that the Colonists were not allowed to settle in new territories.<ref name=\"Drake 1999\"/>\n\n===Failure of diplomacy===\n[[File:King Philip's Seat.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"King Philip's Seat,\" a meeting place on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\nMetacomet became [[sachem]] of the [[Pokanoket]] and Grand Sachem of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Confederacy in 1662 after the death of his older brother Grand Sachem [[Wamsutta]] (called \"Alexander\" by the colonists), who had succeeded their father [[Massasoit]] (d. 1661) as chief. Metacomet was well known to the colonists before his ascension as paramount chief to the Wampanoags, but he distrusted the colonists.\n\nThe Plymouth colonists had passed laws making it illegal to have commerce with the Wampanoags.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They learned that Wamsutta had sold a parcel of land to [[Roger Williams]], so Governor [[Josiah Winslow]] had Wamsutta arrested, even though Wampanoags who lived outside of colonist jurisdiction were not accountable to Plymouth Colony laws. Metacomet began negotiating with the other [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes against the Plymouth Colony soon after the death of his father and his brother.<ref name=\"George Howe 1958\">George Howe, ''Mount Hope'' (1958) {{ISBN|0670490814}}</ref>\n\n===Population===\nThe population of New England colonists totaled about 80,000 people. They lived in 110 towns, of which 64 were in the Massachusetts Bay colony, which then included the southwestern portion of Maine. The towns had about 16,000 men of military age who were almost all part of the militia, as universal training was prevalent in all [[colonial New England]] towns. Many towns had built strong garrison houses for defense, and others had stockades enclosing most of the houses. All of these were strengthened as the war progressed. Some poorly populated towns were abandoned if they did not have enough men to defend them.\n\nEach town had local militias based on all eligible men who had to supply their own arms. Only those who were too old, too young, disabled, or clergy were excused from military service. The militias were usually only minimally trained and initially did relatively poorly against the warring Indians, until more effective training and tactics could be devised. Joint forces of militia volunteers and volunteer Indian allies were found to be the most effective. The Indian allies of the colonists numbered about 1,000 from the [[Mohegan]]s and [[Praying Indian]]s, with about 200 warriors.<ref>Exact numbers of Indian allies are unavailable but about 200 warriors are mentioned in different dispatches implying a total population of about 800-1,000.</ref>\n\nBy 1676, the regional Indian population had decreased to about 10,000 (exact numbers are unavailable), largely because of epidemics. These included about 4,000 Narragansetts of western Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut, 2,400 [[Nipmuck]]s of central and western Massachusetts, and 2,400 combined in the Massachusett and Pawtucket tribes living around Massachusetts Bay and extending northwest to Maine. The Wampanoags and Pokanokets of Plymouth and eastern Rhode Island are thought to have numbered fewer than 1,000. About one in four were considered to be warriors. By then, the Indians had almost universally adopted steel knives, tomahawks, and [[flintlock]] muskets as their weapons. The various tribes had no common government. They had distinct cultures and often warred among themselves,<ref>Herbert L. Osgood, ''The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century'' (1904) 1: 543</ref> although they all spoke related languages from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]].\n\n===The trial===\n[[John Sassamon]] was an Indian convert to Christianity, commonly referred to as a \"[[praying Indian]].\" He played a key role as a \"cultural mediator,\" negotiating with both colonists and Indians while belonging to neither party.{{sfn|Lepore p. 10}} He was an early graduate of [[Harvard College]] and served as a translator and adviser to Metacomet. He reported to the governor of [[Plymouth Colony]] that Metacomet planned to gather allies for Indian attacks on widely dispersed colonial settlements.<ref name=Philbrick>{{cite book |first=Nathaniel |last=Philbrick| year=2006| title=Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War|url=https://archive.org/details/mayflower00nath |url-access=registration | location=New York |publisher= [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]| authorlink=Nathaniel Philbrick}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nMetacomet was brought before a public court, where court officials admitted that they had no proof but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if they had any further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered [[Assawompset Pond]], and Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors. A jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder, and they were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 [[Julian calendar|(O.S.)]], at Plymouth.\n\n==Southern theater, 1675==\n\n=== Raid on Swansea ===\nA band of [[Pokanoket]]s attacked several isolated homesteads in the small Plymouth colony settlement of [[Swansea, Massachusetts|Swansea]] on June 20, 1675.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t5m90c088;view=1up;seq=78| title=The History of King Philip's War| author=Church, Benjamin (1639-1718)| publisher=HathiTrust| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people.

The Narragansetts had not been directly involved in the war, but they had sheltered many of the Wampanoag fighters, women, and children. Some of their warriors had participated in several Indian attacks. The colonists distrusted the tribe and did not understand the various alliances. As the colonial forces went through Rhode Island, they found and burned several Indian towns which had been abandoned by the Narragansetts, who had retreated to a massive fort in a frozen swamp. The [[Little Ice Age|cold weather]] in December froze the swamp so that it was relatively easy to traverse. The colonial force found the Narragansett fort on December 19, 1675, near present-day [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island]]; they attacked in a combined force of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and Connecticut militia numbering about 1,000 men, including about 150 [[Pequots]] and [[Mohican]] Indian allies. The fierce battle that followed is known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. It is believed that the militia killed about 600 Narragansetts. They burned the fort (occupying over {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land) and destroyed most of the tribe's winter stores.\n\nMost of the Narragansett warriors  escaped into the frozen swamp. The colonists lost many of their officers in this assault; about 70 of their men were killed and nearly 150 more wounded.  The rest of the colonial assembled forces returned to their homes, lacking supplies for an extended campaign.

Philip led a force of 1,500 [[Wampanoag]], [[Nipmuc]], and [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] Indians in a dawn attack on the isolated village, which then included all or part of the neighboring modern communities of [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] and [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. They attacked five fortified houses. The house of the Rev. Joseph Rowlandson was set on fire, and most of its occupants were slaughtered\u2014more than 30 people. Rowlandson's wife [[Mary Rowlandson|Mary]] was taken prisoner, and afterward wrote a best-selling [[captivity narrative]] of her experiences. Many of the community's other houses were destroyed before the Indians retreated northward.\n\n=== Plymouth Plantation Campaign ===\n[[File:Site of Nine Men's Misery (Cumberland, Rhode Island).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Site of \"[[Nine Men's Misery]]\" in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island]] where Captain Pierce's troops were tortured]]\nThe spring of 1676 marked the high point for the combined tribes when they attacked Plymouth Plantation on March 12. The town withstood the assault, but the Indians had demonstrated their ability to penetrate deep into colonial territory. They attacked three more settlements; [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]] (near Springfield), Marlborough, and Simsbury were attacked two weeks later. They killed Captain Pierce<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/53528344| title=Capt Michael Pierce's Defeat (1615 - 1676) - Find a Grave Memorial| publisher=| accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref> and a company of Massachusetts soldiers between Pawtucket and the Blackstone's settlement. Several colonial men were tortured and buried at [[Nine Men's Misery]] in [[Cumberland, Rhode Island|Cumberland]] as part of the Indians' ritual torture of enemies. They also burned the settlement of Providence to the ground on March 29. At the same time, a small band of Indians infiltrated and burned part of Springfield while the militia was away.\n\n[[File:Early American Conflict.jpg|thumb|right|Colonists defending their settlement (non-contemporary depiction)]]\nThe settlements within the modern-day [[State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|state of Rhode Island]] became a literal island colony for a time as the settlements at [[Providence Plantations|Providence]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] were sacked and burned, and the residents were driven to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]]. The Connecticut River towns had thousands of acres of cultivated crop land known as the bread basket of New England, but they had to limit their plantings and work in large armed groups for self-protection.<ref name=\"Phelps\">{{cite book| last=Phelps| first=Noah Amherst| title=History of Simsbury, Granby, and Canton; from 1642 to 1845| url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsimsbur00phel| publisher=Press of Case, Tiffany and Burnham| location=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] |year=1845}}</ref>{{rp|20}} Towns such as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]], [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]], and [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] fortified themselves, reinforced their militias, and held their ground, though attacked several times. The small towns of [[Northfield, Massachusetts|Northfield]], [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], and several others were abandoned as the surviving settlers retreated to the larger towns. The towns of the Connecticut colony were largely unharmed in the war, although more than 100 Connecticut militia died in their support of the other colonies.\n\n=== Attack on Sudbury ===\nThe [[Attack on Sudbury]] was fought in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]] on April 21, 1676. The town was surprised by Indian raiders at dawn, who besieged a local [[garrison house]] and burned several unoccupied houses and farms. Reinforcements that arrived from nearby towns were drawn into ambushes by the Indians; Captain Samuel Wadsworth lost his life and half of a 70-man militia in such an ambush.\n\n=== Battle of Turner's Falls ===\nOn May 18, 1676, Captain William Turner of the Massachusetts Militia and a group of about 150 militia volunteers (mostly minimally trained farmers) attacked an Indian fishing camp at Peskeopscut on the [[Connecticut River]], now called [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. The colonists killed 100\u2013200 Indians in retaliation for earlier Indian attacks against Deerfield and other settlements and for the colonial losses in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]]. Turner and nearly 40 of the militia were killed during the return from the falls.<ref>Leach, Douglas Edward, ''Flintlock and Tomahawk \u2013 New England in King Philip's War'', pp. 200\u2013203</ref>\n\nThe colonists defeated an attack at [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] on June 12, 1676 with the help of their [[Mohegan people|Mohegan]] allies, scattering most of the Indian survivors into [[New Hampshire]] and farther north. Later that month, a force of 250 Indians was routed near [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. Combined forces of colonial volunteers and their Indian allies continued to attack, kill, capture, or disperse bands of [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]], [[Nipmucs]], and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] as they tried to plant crops or return to their traditional locations. The colonists granted amnesty to those who surrendered or who were captured and showed that they had not participated in the conflict. Captives who had participated in attacks on the many settlements were hanged, enslaved, or put to [[indentured servitude]], depending upon the colony involved.\n\n=== Battle of Mount Hope ===\n[[File:Colonel Benjamin Church.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]]: Father of [[United States Army Ranger|American Rangers]]]]\nMetacomet's allies began to desert him, and more than 400 had surrendered to the colonists by early July. Metacomet took refuge in the Assowamset Swamp below Providence, and the colonists formed raiding parties of militia and Indian allies. Metacomet was killed by one of these teams when he was tracked down by Captain [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] and Captain [[Josiah Standish]] of the Plymouth Colony militia at Mount Hope in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]]. He was shot and killed by an Indian named [[John Alderman]] on August 12, 1676.<ref name=\"Philip Gould\"/>{{rp|647}} Metacomet's corpse was beheaded, then [[drawn and quartered]], a traditional treatment of criminals in this time period. His head was displayed in Plymouth for a generation.<ref>Schultz, Eric and Michael Tougias. ''King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict\". The Countryman Press. 1999. p. 290</ref>\n\nCaptain Church and his soldiers captured Pocasset war chief Anawan on August 28, 1676 at [[Anawan Rock]] in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]]. He was an old man at the time, and a chief captain of [[Metacomet]]. His capture marked the final event in King Philip's War, as he was also beheaded.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Northern Theater (Maine and Acadia) ==\n[[File:Night Attack of Indians.jpg|thumb|right|Indian revenge on [[Richard Waldron]] for his role in King Philip's War, [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1689)]]\nFrench interests in Maine originated in the fur trade and the sale of fish, both to France. The French colonies in North America were primarily interested in trade and not in creating large cities. Instead, they preferred to convert the Indian population to Catholicism, or else to limit their contact with the Indians to trade. As English presence increased on the southern coast of Maine, the French [[Jesuits]] paid many of the area's tribes for the scalps of Protestant or English settlers, especially the [[Abenaki]]. The Jesuits in charge of coordinating with the tribes were located in a small mission town near [[Norridgewock, Maine]] and led by Jesuit Father [[S\u00e9bastien Rale]]. Two other mission towns were established, one based around [[Castine, Maine]] (established by Baron de St. Castin) and one on the [[Saint Francis River (Canada\u2013United States)|St. Francis River]] between [[New Brunswick]] and Maine.\n\nThe more permanent English settlers moved northward from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, most of them Puritans who were unhappy with the political climate in Massachusetts Bay. Constant friction over many issues became the reason for many Abenaki raids in southern Maine, specifically over the issue of fishing rights for cod. Up until 1675, however, fighting had been limited to minor skirmishes that were more about the destruction of supplies than murder.\n\nWhat is thought to have been the first action in Maine came when a 25-man militia gathered at [[Falmouth, Maine]] in 1675 and sailed to an Indian village, thought to be a part of the Abenaki, with a single sloop towing [[shallops]]. The Indians drove them off and took the shallops from them. Later that month, the tribe crossed the [[Saco River]] in the captured shallops and attacked the settlement of Winter Harbor. Little damage was caused, and similar raids were conducted against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] and Falmouth later that year. The ultimate cause leading to war was the ruling by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] in 1676 making it illegal to sell firearms, powder, or rounds to the area's tribes. New England tribes had grown dependent on the musket for hunting, and the English colonists' remaining Indian allies switched to the French side. The French encouraged them to raid the English settlements, due to the tension in Europe at the time.<ref>See [[War of the Spanish Succession]].</ref>\n\nMuch of the northern fighting was centered around raids meant to destroy property and infrastructure rather than to kill people. The lack of population on both sides meant that large battles were out of the question initially. For the majority of the war, ship combat mostly involved muskets, and the infantry relied more on melee fighting than guns. Later in the war, reinforcements from southern New England introduced modern and well-equipped ships and infantry, turning the tide permanently. This was also the first time that Colonial Rangers were used, acting as guides and scouts for the main party of militia. Much of the fighting was also conducted on the coast in small boats and ships.\n\n[[Richard Waldron]] and [[Charles Frost (military officer)|Charles Frost]] led the English colonial forces in the northern region, while [[Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin]] instructed the tribal chiefs in the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]]. Three major campaigns (one each year) were launched by the Indians in [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1675)|1675]], [[Northwest Coast Campaign (1676)|1676]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1677)|1677]], most of which led to a massive colonial response. Waldron sent forces so far north that he attacked the [[Mi'kmaq]] in [[Acadia]].\n\nThroughout the campaigns, a Wabanaki leader named Mugg Hegone repeatedly attacked towns such as Black Point ([[Scarborough, Maine|Scarborough]]), Wells, and [[Damariscove Island|Damariscove]], building an Indian navy out of the approximately 40 sloops and a dozen 30-ton ships previously armed by militia. Many of Maine's towns were burned, and most of the population left. Maine's fishing industry was completely destroyed by the Wabanaki flotilla. Records from Salem, Maine reported 20 ketches stolen and destroyed in one raid. Mugg Hegone was killed on his third raid on Black Point. With their leader gone, most of the Indian flotilla broke up and was hunted down by New York privateers and Royal Navy vessels.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\">Duncan, Roger F. Coastal Maine: A Maritime History. Woodstock: Countryman, 2002. Print.</ref>\n\nColonial responses to raids generally failed in both their objectives and accomplishments. Few Indians were lost, and only two French Jesuits were reported killed. The colonists were much more successful in the later campaigns when they had the advantage in weapons. Their most successful ventures were a surprise attack near [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in which more than 150 Indians were captured, and in the defense of [[Pemaquid, Maine]] from the Indian flotilla. One of the most notorious raids was in August 1679 when Indians attacked a settlement at the [[Sheepscot River]] near [[Merrymeeting Bay]] in Maine. Sir [[William Phips]] rescued local settlers by bringing them on board his vessel, abandoning his cargo of lumber. He was financially ruined when the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo, although he was recognized as a hero in Boston.<ref>Lounsberry, Alice (1941). ''Sir William Phips''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war, the Northern Campaigns saw approximately 400 settlers die, Maine's fishing economy gone, and the Indians maintaining power in eastern and northern Maine. There is not an accurate account of the number of Indians who died, but it is thought to be between 100 and 300.<ref name=\"Duncan, Roger F 2002\"/> The official fighting ended in the northern theater with the [[Treaty of Casco (1678)]]. Skirmishes continued until [[Father Rale's War]], after which the French left Maine.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Kingphilip.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The site of King Philip's death in Miery Swamp on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)]]]]\n\n=== Southern New England ===\nThe war in southern New England largely ended with Metacomet's death.

About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century.
