Their purpose is to assist recyclers with sorting the collected materials, but they do not necessarily mean that the product/packaging can be recycled either through domestic curbside collection or industrial collections.  The SPI symbols are loosely based on the M\u00f6bius loop symbol, but feature simpler bent (rather than folded over) arrows that can be embossed on plastic surfaces without loss of detail.  The arrows are formed into a flat, two-dimensional triangle rather than the pseudo-three-dimensional triangle used in the original recycling logo.\n\nThe different resin identification codes can be represented by [[Unicode]] icons <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2673</span> (U+2673), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2674</span> (U+2674), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2675</span> (U+2675), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2676</span> (U+2676), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2677</span> (U+2677), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2678</span> (U+2678), <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u2679</span> (U+2679), and <span style=\"font-size:87%;\">\u267a</span> (U+267A).\n\n[[Recycling codes]] extend these numbers above 7 to include various non-plastic materials, including metals, glass, paper, and batteries of various types.\n\n==Other variants==\n[[File:Recycle symbol Taiwan.svg|thumb|[[Taiwan]]'s recycling symbol features the use of [[negative space]] to also create arrows pointing outward]]\n\u267e, an [[infinity]] sign (\u221e) inside a circle, represents the '''permanent paper symbol''',  used in packaging and publishing to signify the use of durable [[acid-free paper]].   In some ways, this logo expresses the ''opposite'' intention from the recycle logo, in that the acid-free paper is intended to last indefinitely, rather than being recycled.  Nevertheless, acid-free paper does not usually contain toxic materials (although certain inks do), so it is easily recycled or composted.\n\nA satirical version of the classic recycling logo also exists, in which the three arrows are twisted from a circular pattern to pointing radially outward, thus symbolizing wasteful one-time usage rather than environmentally friendly recycling.  This message is reinforced by the circular inscription, \"THIS PROJECT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY\", surrounding the modified logo.

The Wages for Housework Campaign shared with ''operaismo'' the idea that fair working conditions including wages are key to the social recognition of labor. ''Operaismo'' encouraged workers to act in their direct interests, and engage in factory strikes to demand better conditions.

The Wages for Housework Campaign shared with ''operaismo'' the idea that fair working conditions including wages are key to the social recognition of labor. ''Operaismo'' encouraged workers to act in their direct interests, and engage in factory strikes to demand better conditions.

The result was Killing Joke's eighth album, ''[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]'', released on the German [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise International]] label in 1990.

Relations later soured between Coleman and Shihad due to a dispute over Coleman's production fee for ''Churn''.\n\nThe reactivated Killing Joke released two strong and well-received albums on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, ''Pandemonium'' and ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'', which saw the band shifting to a more varied approach and employing young talent like Waxworth Industries for 12-inch remixes.

The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven's name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003-2004, with ex-Prong drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.\n\nIn February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, [[Sack Trick]]), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. [[DVD]] and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s British tour; they then began work on their next album in [[Prague]].

It marked a return to a heavier sound, while incorporating elements of the previous two albums as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/mar/19/old-music-killing-joke-age-greed|title=Old music: Killing Joke \u2013 Age of Greed|first=Martin|last=Belam|date=19 March 2012|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/extremities-dirt-and-various-repressed-emotions-mw0000311317|title=Extremities, Dirt and Various Repressed Emotions - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> \"[[Money Is Not Our God]]\" was the lead single. Once again, the band toured Europe and North America, but by the middle of 1991, the new line-up had imploded. Coleman emigrated to New Zealand to live on a remote Pacific island, and Killing Joke entered a hiatus period.\n\nAtkins continued with Walker, Raven and the band's live keyboard player, [[John Bechdel]], as the short-lived [[Murder, Inc. (band)|Murder, Inc.]], recruiting Scottish vocalist [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] and reuniting with Ferguson as second drummer.\n\n===Return of Youth (1992\u20131996)===\n[[File:Killing Joke-1994-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|Youth and Coleman (1994)]]\nA Killing Joke anthology, ''Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!'', was released in 1992; during its production, Walker became reacquainted with Youth, who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs \"Change\" and \"Wardance\" in several new versions remixed by Youth, who was by then a very successful producer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/youth-killing-joke-paul-mccartney|title=Youth: From Killing Joke to Paul McCartney|website=Soundonsound.com}}</ref>\n\nColeman produced the 1993 debut album ''[[Churn (Shihad album)|Churn]]'' by the New Zealand band [[Shihad]], and Shihad drummer [[Tom Larkin]] played on some of the songs on the next Killing Joke album, ''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]''. Relations later soured between Coleman and Shihad due to a dispute over Coleman's production fee for ''Churn''.\n\nThe reactivated Killing Joke released two strong and well-received albums on Youth's [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, ''Pandemonium'' and ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'', which saw the band shifting to a more varied approach and employing young talent like Waxworth Industries for 12-inch remixes. The heavy, \"trance-inducing\" ''Pandemonium'' (1994) featured some of the Egyptian musicians that Coleman had previously worked with on ''Songs from the Victorious City'', including percussionist [[Hossam Ramzy]] and violinist Aboud Abdel Al.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pandemonium-mw0000119138|title=Pandemonium - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/|title=Kerrang!|website=Kerrang!}}</ref>, and earned Killing Joke a memorable ''Top of the Pops'' appearance for the single \"Millennium\", which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20).

Self-published.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the band recorded the song \"Hollywood Babylon\" for the soundtrack of [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s movie ''[[Showgirls]]''.\n\n''Democracy'' (1996) was more introspective and optimistic, introducing acoustic guitar into the mix, and garnered mixed reviews ranging from \"watered down\" to \"Killing Joke's best album in 11 years\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/killingjoke-pandaemonium-2495959879.html|title=Killing Joke: Pandemonium / Democracy|date=29 September 2005|website=PopMatters}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/democracy-mw0000182237|title=Democracy - Killing Joke &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The title track was again released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of ''Pandemonium'' and all of ''Democracy'' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore. He also played live with the band throughout this era. [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on ''Democracy'' and ''XXV Gathering''. Youth bowed out of live performance early in the ''Democracy'' tour and was replaced by [[Troy Gregory]], previously of [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref name=\"Hightower-Volume_30\" />\n\nAfter the ''Democracy'' tour, the band went on an extended hiatus. Coleman and Youth produced a string of well-received orchestral rock albums based on the music of [[classic rock]] artists such as Led Zeppelin, [[Pink Floyd]] and [[the Doors]].

The album, which fell just short of the UK Top 40 and spawned two singles, \"Loose Cannon\" (a UK Top 25 hit) and \"Seeing Red\". The songs were all credited to Coleman/Walker/Youth/Gill, although Raven's name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003-2004, with ex-Prong drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.\n\nIn February 2005, now with young drummer Ben Calvert (Twin Zero, [[Sack Trick]]), Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London's [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. [[DVD]] and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of the same year as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by remasters of their first four albums (''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the E.G. Records catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008. That year, Reza Udhin joined the band on keyboards when they supported [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]'s British tour; they then began work on their next album in [[Prague]].

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile.

No central database of Creative Commons works is controlling all licensed works and the responsibility of the Creative Commons system rests entirely with those using the licences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This situation is, however, not specific to Creative Commons. All copyright owners must individually defend their rights and no central database of copyrighted works or existing license agreements exists. The [[United States Copyright Office]] does keep a database of all works registered with it, but absence of registration does not imply absence of copyright, and CC licensed works can be registered on the same terms as unlicenced works or works licensed under any other licences.\n\nAlthough Creative Commons offers multiple licenses for different uses, some critics suggested that the licenses still do not address the differences among the media or among the various concerns that different authors have.<ref name=\"Niva Elkin-Koren, Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit\" />\n\nLessig wrote that the point of Creative Commons is to provide a middle ground between two extreme views of copyright protection \u2013 one demanding that all rights be controlled, and the other arguing that none should be controlled. Creative Commons provides a third option that allows authors to pick and choose which rights they want to control and which they want to grant to others. The multitude of licenses reflects the multitude of rights that can be passed on to subsequent creators.<ref name=\"Lawrence Lessig, The Creative Commons\" />\n\n===Criticism of the non-commercial license===\n[[File:Defining noncommercial Creative Commons 2009.pdf|thumb|\"Defining 'Noncommercial'\", a 2009 report from Creative Commons on the concept of noncommercial media]]\n{{main|Creative Commons NonCommercial license}}\nVarious commentators have reported confusion in understanding what \"noncommercial\" use means. Creative Commons issued a report in 2009, \"Defining noncommercial\", which presented research and various perspectives. The report claimed that noncommercial to many people means \"no exchange of money or any commerce\". Beyond that simple statement, many people disagree on whether noncommercial use permits publishing on websites supported with advertising, sharing noncommercial media through nonprofit publishing for a fee, and many other practices in contemporary media distribution. Creative Commons has not sought to resolve the confusion, in part because of high consumer demand for the noncommercial license as is with its ambiguity.\n\n===Personality rights===\nIn 2007, [[Virgin Mobile Australia]] launched a bus stop advertising campaign which promoted its mobile phone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to the photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] using a [[Creative Commons Attribution 2.5|Creative Commons by Attribution]] license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation being required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL, leading to the photographer's Flickr page, on each of their ads. However, one picture depicted 15-year-old Alison Chang posing for a photo at her church's fund-raising carwash, with the superimposed, mocking slogan \"Dump Your Pen Friend\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8494 |title=Lawsuit over Virgin Mobile's use of Flickr girl blames Creative Commons |work=Out-law.com |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\"permission\">{{cite news|first=Noam|last=Cohen|title=Use My Photo?

Creative Commons licenses do not replace copyright but are based upon it. They replace individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owner (licensor) and [[licensee]], which are necessary under an \"all rights reserved\" copyright management, with a \"some rights reserved\" management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no commercial compensation is sought by the copyright owner.

No central database of Creative Commons works is controlling all licensed works and the responsibility of the Creative Commons system rests entirely with those using the licences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} This situation is, however, not specific to Creative Commons. All copyright owners must individually defend their rights and no central database of copyrighted works or existing license agreements exists. The [[United States Copyright Office]] does keep a database of all works registered with it, but absence of registration does not imply absence of copyright, and CC licensed works can be registered on the same terms as unlicenced works or works licensed under any other licences.\n\nAlthough Creative Commons offers multiple licenses for different uses, some critics suggested that the licenses still do not address the differences among the media or among the various concerns that different authors have.<ref name=\"Niva Elkin-Koren, Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit\" />\n\nLessig wrote that the point of Creative Commons is to provide a middle ground between two extreme views of copyright protection \u2013 one demanding that all rights be controlled, and the other arguing that none should be controlled. Creative Commons provides a third option that allows authors to pick and choose which rights they want to control and which they want to grant to others.

Creative Commons issued a report in 2009, \"Defining noncommercial\", which presented research and various perspectives. The report claimed that noncommercial to many people means \"no exchange of money or any commerce\". Beyond that simple statement, many people disagree on whether noncommercial use permits publishing on websites supported with advertising, sharing noncommercial media through nonprofit publishing for a fee, and many other practices in contemporary media distribution. Creative Commons has not sought to resolve the confusion, in part because of high consumer demand for the noncommercial license as is with its ambiguity.\n\n===Personality rights===\nIn 2007, [[Virgin Mobile Australia]] launched a bus stop advertising campaign which promoted its mobile phone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to the photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] using a [[Creative Commons Attribution 2.5|Creative Commons by Attribution]] license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation being required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL, leading to the photographer's Flickr page, on each of their ads. However, one picture depicted 15-year-old Alison Chang posing for a photo at her church's fund-raising carwash, with the superimposed, mocking slogan \"Dump Your Pen Friend\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8494 |title=Lawsuit over Virgin Mobile's use of Flickr girl blames Creative Commons |work=Out-law.com |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref><ref name=\"permission\">{{cite news|first=Noam|last=Cohen|title=Use My Photo?

The racetrack closed in 1995 and the arena in 2002; the facility was demolished in 2005, and is currently being redeveloped for a variety of uses, including dormitory housing for the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] and the [[Aksarben Village]] development.\n\nAk-Sar-Ben is \"Nebraska\" spelled backwards.  The Knights originally said they were turning Nebraska around, thus \"Ak-Sar-Ben.\"\n\n==History==\n===Coliseum=== \nAk-Sar-Ben Coliseum was the premiere [[ice rink]] and [[concert]] [[arena]] in Omaha for more than 70 years. Popular acts ranging from [[Frank Sinatra]] to [[Elvis Presley]] to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] all performed to sold-out crowds.  It was also home to the [[Omaha Knights]], a [[minor league]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] team from 1959 to 1975. The Knights began operations in 1959 in the [[International Hockey League (1945&ndash;2001)|IHL]], and later moved to the now-defunct [[Central Hockey League (1963&ndash;1984)|CHL]], with teams affiliated with the [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[New York Rangers]], and both the [[Calgary Flames|Calgary and Atlanta Flames]].  The arena hosted the [[United States Hockey League|USHL]]'s [[Omaha Lancers]] for its final dozen years and the [[Omaha Racers]] [[basketball]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] from 1989 to 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=History of the Continental Basketball Association|url=http://hometown.aol.com/bradleyrd/cba7801.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wowt.com/sports/headlines/Omaha-Racers-Reunite-20-Years-After-Winning-CBA-Title-220952401.html |title=Omaha Racers Reunite 20 Years After Winning CBA Title |last1=Jernstrom |first1=Ross |last2= |first2= |date=August 24, 2013 |website=[[WOWT]] |publisher=[[Gray Television]] |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> The Coliseum also hosted world-class [[boxing]], was a major stop on the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] and attracted many popular comedians.\n\n===Horse racing===\nIn the racetrack's glory days, the Coliseum housed a cinema-sized screen and betting windows to handle the overflow of fans. In the mid-1980s, Ak-Sar-Ben was tenth in the nation in racetrack attendance, with up to 25,000 betting $2 million per day on weekends. Many festivals were also held in the Coliseum annually, including a Greek Festival and River City Roundup booths.\n\nFollowing his death in 1959, the 1935 [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] winner [[Omaha (horse)|Omaha]] was buried at the racetrack's Circle of Champions.  The [[thoroughbred]] spent his final nine years at a farm outside of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]] and made promotional appearances at the Ak-Sar-Ben racetrack during the 1950s.\n\n==Closure and demolition==\nHorse racing at Ak-Sar-Ben ended in August 1995, just ten years after its record season of 1985. [[Dog racing]] began in adjacent [[Iowa]] in 1986 and other forms of gambling followed, and attendance rapidly declined at Ak-Sar-Ben.

The racetrack closed in 1995 and the arena in 2002; the facility was demolished in 2005, and is currently being redeveloped for a variety of uses, including dormitory housing for the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] and the [[Aksarben Village]] development.\n\nAk-Sar-Ben is \"Nebraska\" spelled backwards.  The Knights originally said they were turning Nebraska around, thus \"Ak-Sar-Ben.\"\n\n==History==\n===Coliseum=== \nAk-Sar-Ben Coliseum was the premiere [[ice rink]] and [[concert]] [[arena]] in Omaha for more than 70 years. Popular acts ranging from [[Frank Sinatra]] to [[Elvis Presley]] to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] all performed to sold-out crowds.  It was also home to the [[Omaha Knights]], a [[minor league]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] team from 1959 to 1975. The Knights began operations in 1959 in the [[International Hockey League (1945&ndash;2001)|IHL]], and later moved to the now-defunct [[Central Hockey League (1963&ndash;1984)|CHL]], with teams affiliated with the [[National Hockey League|NHL's]] [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[New York Rangers]], and both the [[Calgary Flames|Calgary and Atlanta Flames]].  The arena hosted the [[United States Hockey League|USHL]]'s [[Omaha Lancers]] for its final dozen years and the [[Omaha Racers]] [[basketball]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] from 1989 to 1997.<ref>{{cite news|title=History of the Continental Basketball Association|url=http://hometown.aol.com/bradleyrd/cba7801.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wowt.com/sports/headlines/Omaha-Racers-Reunite-20-Years-After-Winning-CBA-Title-220952401.html |title=Omaha Racers Reunite 20 Years After Winning CBA Title |last1=Jernstrom |first1=Ross |last2= |first2= |date=August 24, 2013 |website=[[WOWT]] |publisher=[[Gray Television]] |accessdate=November 5, 2013}}</ref> The Coliseum also hosted world-class [[boxing]], was a major stop on the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]] and attracted many popular comedians.\n\n===Horse racing===\nIn the racetrack's glory days, the Coliseum housed a cinema-sized screen and betting windows to handle the overflow of fans. In the mid-1980s, Ak-Sar-Ben was tenth in the nation in racetrack attendance, with up to 25,000 betting $2 million per day on weekends. Many festivals were also held in the Coliseum annually, including a Greek Festival and River City Roundup booths.\n\nFollowing his death in 1959, the 1935 [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] winner [[Omaha (horse)|Omaha]] was buried at the racetrack's Circle of Champions.  The [[thoroughbred]] spent his final nine years at a farm outside of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]] and made promotional appearances at the Ak-Sar-Ben racetrack during the 1950s.\n\n==Closure and demolition==\nHorse racing at Ak-Sar-Ben ended in August 1995, just ten years after its record season of 1985. [[Dog racing]] began in adjacent [[Iowa]] in 1986 and other forms of gambling followed, and attendance rapidly declined at Ak-Sar-Ben. A portion of the property was sold to First Data Resources under the agreement that FDR would donate part of the land to the [[University of Nebraska Omaha]] (UNO) for its Aksarben Campus to build a new College of Information and Technology.<ref>(nd) [http://www.ist.unomaha.edu/ College of Information and Technology].</ref>\n\nAfter the remaining buildings and grandstand were torn down in early 2005, a proposal was put forth to create a mixed-use development called [[Aksarben Village]].<ref>(nd) [http://www.aksarbenvillage.com  Aksarben Village].
