When set up, this type of trailer provides a large amount of interior space when compared to its size when collapsed. Its relatively affordable price makes it a popular choice for some RVers and its small size contributes to easier [[towing]] than many other types of RVs.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:JaycoPopupCamperClosed-2009-11-19.jpg|thumb|right|Same pop-up camper closed for travel]]\nA conventional pop-up consists of a trailer frame, a box, a hard roof, pull-out bunks and \u201csoft\u201d walls. The walls are made of [[Vinyl siding|vinyl]], canvas or a similar material and include windows with screens.\n\nBasic popups usually include the following features: fold-down dinette (table top and bench seating combination), on-board fresh water tank, sink, 12-volt DC power system (including an AC to DC converter and a [[deep cycle battery]]), interior DC lighting, two sleeping bunks and storage cabinets. Many pop-ups also include a gas/electric [[absorption refrigerator]], stove, rooftop [[air conditioner]], propane furnace, water heater, electric water pump, exterior shower, skylight/roof vent, one or two propane tanks, electric or surge [[brakes]], large storage trunk at the front of the box, and an awning. Some premium models also include a shower, toilet, wastewater tanks, slide-out section (to increase interior space), [[Microwave oven|microwave]], and an oven.<ref>[http://www.campingearth.com/popups/ A Complete Guide To Popup Campers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince space is at a premium in popup campers, it is common for a single structure to serve multiple purposes. Generally, the dinette, which can seat four people for a meal, can be converted into a bed to provide additional sleeping space. Likewise, the couch, if present, can usually be folded down into a bed. Often, the inside table (part of the dinette) and the gas stove can be taken outside and attached to the side of the camper.\n\n===Dimensions===\nModern pop-ups range in weight from approximately {{convert|700|lb|kg}} to {{convert|3800|lb|kg}} <ref>https://www.rvingknowhow.com/average-pop-up-camper-weight/</ref>pounds empty or full.

When set up, this type of trailer provides a large amount of interior space when compared to its size when collapsed. Its relatively affordable price makes it a popular choice for some RVers and its small size contributes to easier [[towing]] than many other types of RVs.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:JaycoPopupCamperClosed-2009-11-19.jpg|thumb|right|Same pop-up camper closed for travel]]\nA conventional pop-up consists of a trailer frame, a box, a hard roof, pull-out bunks and \u201csoft\u201d walls. The walls are made of [[Vinyl siding|vinyl]], canvas or a similar material and include windows with screens.\n\nBasic popups usually include the following features: fold-down dinette (table top and bench seating combination), on-board fresh water tank, sink, 12-volt DC power system (including an AC to DC converter and a [[deep cycle battery]]), interior DC lighting, two sleeping bunks and storage cabinets. Many pop-ups also include a gas/electric [[absorption refrigerator]], stove, rooftop [[air conditioner]], propane furnace, water heater, electric water pump, exterior shower, skylight/roof vent, one or two propane tanks, electric or surge [[brakes]], large storage trunk at the front of the box, and an awning. Some premium models also include a shower, toilet, wastewater tanks, slide-out section (to increase interior space), [[Microwave oven|microwave]], and an oven.<ref>[http://www.campingearth.com/popups/ A Complete Guide To Popup Campers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince space is at a premium in popup campers, it is common for a single structure to serve multiple purposes. Generally, the dinette, which can seat four people for a meal, can be converted into a bed to provide additional sleeping space. Likewise, the couch, if present, can usually be folded down into a bed. Often, the inside table (part of the dinette) and the gas stove can be taken outside and attached to the side of the camper.\n\n===Dimensions===\nModern pop-ups range in weight from approximately {{convert|700|lb|kg}} to {{convert|3800|lb|kg}} pounds empty or full. Models are generally classified by the length of their box, which ranges from {{convert|8|ft|m}} to {{convert|16|ft|m}}. When opened, the length is roughly double the box length.

{"title_page": "Campervan", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of vehicle}}\n{{For|mobile homes without a built-in motor vehicle|travel trailer}}\n[[File:White Fiat Ducato Campervan 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|A coachbuilt [[Fiat]] campervan]]\n\nA '''campervan''' (or '''camper van'''), sometimes referred to as a '''camper''', '''caravanette''', or '''motor caravan''' is a self-propelled vehicle that provides both transport and sleeping accommodation. The term mainly describes vans that have been fitted out, often with a [[coachbuilding|coachbuilt]] body for use as accommodation.\n\n== Ambiguity with motorhome ==\n[[File:Motorhome-RV-Class-C-Sprinter-Ford-Chassis.jpg|thumb|240px|Two Class C campervans, a [[Freightliner Sprinter]] (left) and [[Ford E-Series]] (right) chassis.]]\n[[Image:Clubman.jpg|thumb|right|Volkswagen Autosleeper Clubman GL, a typical European campervan]]\nThe term [[motorhome]] is sometimes used interchangeably with campervan, but the former can also be a larger vehicle than a campervan and intended to be more comfortable, whilst the latter is more concerned with ease of movement and lower cost.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.campervan-adventures.com/campervans/index.htm | title=Campervans and motorhomes| work =Campervan Adventures }}</ref> For example, some campervans lack built-in toilets and showers, or a divide between the living compartment and the cab.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discovery-motorhomes.co.nz/differences.php | title=What are the Differences Between a Campervan and a Motorhome? | work =Discovery Homes New Zealand}}</ref>\n\nThe United States term \"[[recreational vehicle]]\" (RV) is more analogous to motorhome than campervan.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Features ==\nCampervans may be equipped either with a \"pop-up\" roof which is raised during [[camping]] or a fixed roof, either shared with the  commercial [[van]] that forms the basis of the vehicle (commonly a \"high-top\" model), or as part of a custom coachbuilt body.\n\nCampervans usually have a small kitchen with a [[refrigerator]] (which is often powerable by a choice of gas, battery, or mains electricity) and a two-burner gas [[Kitchen stove|hob]] and [[Grill (cooking)|grill]]. They generally have dual-voltage lighting which can work from either a dedicated battery (other than the van battery) known as a deep-cycle<ref>https://www.rvingknowhow.com/rv-deep-cycle-battery/</ref> or ''leisure battery'', or from [[AC power]], supplied at a [[campsite]] via a hook-up cable. Larger models may include a water heater, space heating and air conditioning, a [[portable toilet]] and even an internal shower. Smaller models often carry a \"porta-potty\" portable toilet, and sometimes an external shower which operates within the privacy of an awning.\n\nThe term \"[[Dormobile]]\" is sometimes used generically in the [[United Kingdom]] thanks to a once highly popular conversion brand, and \"Kombi\" is used in [[Australia]] and other countries. The popularity of this type expanded in the 1950s after [[Volkswagen]] commissioned the [[Westfalia]] company to use the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Kombi]] version of their [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 transporter]] as the basis for a campervan.\n\n== Off-road variations ==\n\nOften called a [[4WD]] camper or [[4x4]] camper, these vehicles are perfect for going off the beaten track and exploring unsealed roads. Some models include expandable tents mounted on the roof while others have pop-up roofs for additional sleeping space and storage.\n\nPop-up roof variants share certain design elements with [[roof tent]]s as sometimes fitted to more robust [[four wheel drive]] [[off-road vehicle]]s intended for expeditions rather than relaxed camping. A compromise between these two worlds is sometimes reached by basing the conversion on an off-road vehicle. Sometimes the conversion is demountable from the back of a [[pickup truck|pick-up]] truck body.\n\n== Classic Volkswagen and other campervans ==\n[[Image:VW Camper.jpg|Classic Volkswagen Camper|thumb|right]]\n{{Main|Volkswagen Westfalia Campers}}\n\nThere are several types of campervan all manufactured by [[Volkswagen]] but depending on their age they are colloquially referred to as either a [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)|splitty]] (split windscreen) a [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|bay]] (bay framed windscreen) or a [[Volkswagen Type 2  (T3)|bricky]] (\"brick\" shaped van).\n\nAlthough less popular, Mercedes also manufactured a similar-sized light van and conversions were reasonably common in the 1960s and '70s. Of a similar size and vintage is the British [[Commer Spacevan]] conversion.\n\n[[Image:Citro\u00ebn_Camionette_Type_H_Schaffen-Diest.jpg|Dutch-built version - with non-[[Suicide_door|suicide doors]] - of [[Citro\u00ebn_H_Van|Citro\u00ebn H-Van]] Camper|thumb|right]]In Europe the [[Citro\u00ebn_H_Van|Citro\u00ebn H-Van]] has also been used a base for many campervan conversions, and is popular amongst Dutch and Belgian users in particular. Ex-factory, it had several height and length configurations, and in all versions it had a low floor and high ceiling, a legacy of one of its original uses as a mobile shop. It does not usually need a pop-top to accommodate its users.\n\nModern mid-sized Japanese vans such as the [[Toyota Hiace]] are sometimes converted to have the appearance of a classic Volkswagen.\n\n== New concept car camper ==\n\nThe car camper is a station wagon converted into a travel home. The rear cargo area is converted into a full double bed area usually with a fabricated aluminium framework. All equipment necessary to set up a well-appointed camp site is stored under the double bed with access through lidded areas under the bed. Unlike a standard station wagon where the camping equipment has to be removed before sleeping or a tent set up, the car camper is self-contained.\n\n== British and European size and type classifications ==\n\n=== A-class (AC) ===\n\nSimilar to North American A-class recreational vehicles (sometimes known generically as \"Winnebagos\") but generally still smaller in [[Europe]]. Fully coachbuilt over a medium-to-large van chassis, from 7.5 tonnes and upwards. Highly appointed, sometimes with electrically operated slide-out (sideways) extensions to the living space, electricity-generating windmills and in very large models (of North American scale) sometimes even fitted with a [[fluid power|hydraulically]] operated garage capable of transporting a small car.\n\nSmaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A class vehicles are also popular in Europe, similar in size to Overcab Coachbuilts, but without the base vehicles cab. In its place, a (wider) cab is added, which allows for a drop-down bed to be fitted above. Recognisable by their large curved windscreens.\n\n=== Overcab (OC) ===\n[[File:CamperIVECOlaika.jpg|thumb|right|Typical \"overcab\" camper on a relatively large [[Iveco]] van base]]\n\nCoachbuilt body, retaining the base van's cab, with a raised [[Luton van]] style area over the cab containing a bed.<ref>{{cite book | last=Dorey | first=M. | title=The Camper Van Bible: Live, Eat, Sleep (Repeat) | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-4729-2655-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggklDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 | access-date=December 17, 2018 | page=74}}</ref> Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling.  Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Sometimes including a garage for bikes, and may be large enough to support a mechanism for towing a small [[city car]]. Roughly comparable to the North American C-class (CC).\n\nCommon base vehicles include the [[Fiat Ducato]], [[Renault Master]], and [[Ford Transit]].\n\n=== Low profile (LP) ===\n\nCoachbuilt but without a raised bed over the cab. Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling.  Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Garages and towing fittings may be carried as with the overcab designs.\n\nTypical base vehicles are lighter-duty and/or smaller-engined variants of the same vehicles used for overcab designs.\n\n=== High top (HT) ===\n[[Image:TalbotAutoSleeper1991.jpg|thumb|right|Autosleeper Harmony \"high top\" Campervan]]\n\nBased on a high-top van, typically of around 2.8 to 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight, without major coachbuilding modifications to the body. Beds typically fixed in place or built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles sometimes fitted.\n\nTypical base vehicles are the same as for the coachbuilt designs, above. Oftentimes a Dodge, GMC or Ford van will be professionally converted into a high top.\n\n=== Rising roof (RR) ===\n[[Image:Mazda-E2000-Campervan.jpg|thumb|right|Mazda \"rising roof\" campervan]]\n\nOften based on a relatively small van, typically 2 to 3 tonnes gross vehicle weight, including the classic Volkswagen Type 2, and with a roof which raises, usually with fabric sides, in a way not unlike a roof tent. Bed typically in the rising roof but also sometimes built by moving seats and tables. A rising roof is also sometimes used to allow for standing room in the vehicle.<ref>{{cite book | last=Watts | first=M.P. | title=Worcestershire's Motoring Heritage | publisher=Amberley Publishing | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4456-3714-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCxmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT109 | access-date=December 17, 2018 | page=109}}</ref> Shower and toilet cubicles rarely fitted.\n\nThe [[Volkswagen Transporter]] is a common base vehicle, and [[Ford Transit]]s are also reasonably common.\n\n=== Fixed roof (FR) ===\n\nAlso known as \"surf vans\" (or \"surf buses\") and \"day vans\". Typically similar in size to the rising roof designs. Beds usually built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles very rarely fitted.\n\nThe [[Volkswagen Transporter]] and [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] are particularly common base vehicles. They have become the successors to the classic Volkswagen Type 2.

The term mainly describes vans that have been fitted out, often with a [[coachbuilding|coachbuilt]] body for use as accommodation.\n\n== Ambiguity with motorhome ==\n[[File:Motorhome-RV-Class-C-Sprinter-Ford-Chassis.jpg|thumb|240px|Two Class C campervans, a [[Freightliner Sprinter]] (left) and [[Ford E-Series]] (right) chassis.]]\n[[Image:Clubman.jpg|thumb|right|Volkswagen Autosleeper Clubman GL, a typical European campervan]]\nThe term [[motorhome]] is sometimes used interchangeably with campervan, but the former can also be a larger vehicle than a campervan and intended to be more comfortable, whilst the latter is more concerned with ease of movement and lower cost.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.campervan-adventures.com/campervans/index.htm | title=Campervans and motorhomes| work =Campervan Adventures }}</ref> For example, some campervans lack built-in toilets and showers, or a divide between the living compartment and the cab.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.discovery-motorhomes.co.nz/differences.php | title=What are the Differences Between a Campervan and a Motorhome? | work =Discovery Homes New Zealand}}</ref>\n\nThe United States term \"[[recreational vehicle]]\" (RV) is more analogous to motorhome than campervan.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Features ==\nCampervans may be equipped either with a \"pop-up\" roof which is raised during [[camping]] or a fixed roof, either shared with the  commercial [[van]] that forms the basis of the vehicle (commonly a \"high-top\" model), or as part of a custom coachbuilt body.\n\nCampervans usually have a small kitchen with a [[refrigerator]] (which is often powerable by a choice of gas, battery, or mains electricity) and a two-burner gas [[Kitchen stove|hob]] and [[Grill (cooking)|grill]]. They generally have dual-voltage lighting which can work from either a dedicated battery (other than the van battery) known as a deep-cycle or ''leisure battery'', or from [[AC power]], supplied at a [[campsite]] via a hook-up cable. Larger models may include a water heater, space heating and air conditioning, a [[portable toilet]] and even an internal shower. Smaller models often carry a \"porta-potty\" portable toilet, and sometimes an external shower which operates within the privacy of an awning.\n\nThe term \"[[Dormobile]]\" is sometimes used generically in the [[United Kingdom]] thanks to a once highly popular conversion brand, and \"Kombi\" is used in [[Australia]] and other countries. The popularity of this type expanded in the 1950s after [[Volkswagen]] commissioned the [[Westfalia]] company to use the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Kombi]] version of their [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 transporter]] as the basis for a campervan.\n\n== Off-road variations ==\n\nOften called a [[4WD]] camper or [[4x4]] camper, these vehicles are perfect for going off the beaten track and exploring unsealed roads. Some models include expandable tents mounted on the roof while others have pop-up roofs for additional sleeping space and storage.\n\nPop-up roof variants share certain design elements with [[roof tent]]s as sometimes fitted to more robust [[four wheel drive]] [[off-road vehicle]]s intended for expeditions rather than relaxed camping. A compromise between these two worlds is sometimes reached by basing the conversion on an off-road vehicle. Sometimes the conversion is demountable from the back of a [[pickup truck|pick-up]] truck body.\n\n== Classic Volkswagen and other campervans ==\n[[Image:VW Camper.jpg|Classic Volkswagen Camper|thumb|right]]\n{{Main|Volkswagen Westfalia Campers}}\n\nThere are several types of campervan all manufactured by [[Volkswagen]] but depending on their age they are colloquially referred to as either a [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T1)|splitty]] (split windscreen) a [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|bay]] (bay framed windscreen) or a [[Volkswagen Type 2  (T3)|bricky]] (\"brick\" shaped van).\n\nAlthough less popular, Mercedes also manufactured a similar-sized light van and conversions were reasonably common in the 1960s and '70s. Of a similar size and vintage is the British [[Commer Spacevan]] conversion.\n\n[[Image:Citro\u00ebn_Camionette_Type_H_Schaffen-Diest.jpg|Dutch-built version - with non-[[Suicide_door|suicide doors]] - of [[Citro\u00ebn_H_Van|Citro\u00ebn H-Van]] Camper|thumb|right]]In Europe the [[Citro\u00ebn_H_Van|Citro\u00ebn H-Van]] has also been used a base for many campervan conversions, and is popular amongst Dutch and Belgian users in particular. Ex-factory, it had several height and length configurations, and in all versions it had a low floor and high ceiling, a legacy of one of its original uses as a mobile shop. It does not usually need a pop-top to accommodate its users.\n\nModern mid-sized Japanese vans such as the [[Toyota Hiace]] are sometimes converted to have the appearance of a classic Volkswagen.\n\n== New concept car camper ==\n\nThe car camper is a station wagon converted into a travel home. The rear cargo area is converted into a full double bed area usually with a fabricated aluminium framework. All equipment necessary to set up a well-appointed camp site is stored under the double bed with access through lidded areas under the bed. Unlike a standard station wagon where the camping equipment has to be removed before sleeping or a tent set up, the car camper is self-contained.\n\n== British and European size and type classifications ==\n\n=== A-class (AC) ===\n\nSimilar to North American A-class recreational vehicles (sometimes known generically as \"Winnebagos\") but generally still smaller in [[Europe]]. Fully coachbuilt over a medium-to-large van chassis, from 7.5 tonnes and upwards. Highly appointed, sometimes with electrically operated slide-out (sideways) extensions to the living space, electricity-generating windmills and in very large models (of North American scale) sometimes even fitted with a [[fluid power|hydraulically]] operated garage capable of transporting a small car.\n\nSmaller (sub 7.5 tonnes) A class vehicles are also popular in Europe, similar in size to Overcab Coachbuilts, but without the base vehicles cab. In its place, a (wider) cab is added, which allows for a drop-down bed to be fitted above. Recognisable by their large curved windscreens.\n\n=== Overcab (OC) ===\n[[File:CamperIVECOlaika.jpg|thumb|right|Typical \"overcab\" camper on a relatively large [[Iveco]] van base]]\n\nCoachbuilt body, retaining the base van's cab, with a raised [[Luton van]] style area over the cab containing a bed.<ref>{{cite book | last=Dorey | first=M. | title=The Camper Van Bible: Live, Eat, Sleep (Repeat) | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-4729-2655-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ggklDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 | access-date=December 17, 2018 | page=74}}</ref> Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling.  Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Sometimes including a garage for bikes, and may be large enough to support a mechanism for towing a small [[city car]]. Roughly comparable to the North American C-class (CC).\n\nCommon base vehicles include the [[Fiat Ducato]], [[Renault Master]], and [[Ford Transit]].\n\n=== Low profile (LP) ===\n\nCoachbuilt but without a raised bed over the cab. Other beds may be fixed in place, built by moving seats and tables, or lowered from the ceiling.  Shower and toilet cubicles usually fitted. Garages and towing fittings may be carried as with the overcab designs.\n\nTypical base vehicles are lighter-duty and/or smaller-engined variants of the same vehicles used for overcab designs.\n\n=== High top (HT) ===\n[[Image:TalbotAutoSleeper1991.jpg|thumb|right|Autosleeper Harmony \"high top\" Campervan]]\n\nBased on a high-top van, typically of around 2.8 to 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight, without major coachbuilding modifications to the body. Beds typically fixed in place or built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles sometimes fitted.\n\nTypical base vehicles are the same as for the coachbuilt designs, above. Oftentimes a Dodge, GMC or Ford van will be professionally converted into a high top.\n\n=== Rising roof (RR) ===\n[[Image:Mazda-E2000-Campervan.jpg|thumb|right|Mazda \"rising roof\" campervan]]\n\nOften based on a relatively small van, typically 2 to 3 tonnes gross vehicle weight, including the classic Volkswagen Type 2, and with a roof which raises, usually with fabric sides, in a way not unlike a roof tent. Bed typically in the rising roof but also sometimes built by moving seats and tables. A rising roof is also sometimes used to allow for standing room in the vehicle.<ref>{{cite book | last=Watts | first=M.P. | title=Worcestershire's Motoring Heritage | publisher=Amberley Publishing | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4456-3714-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCxmBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT109 | access-date=December 17, 2018 | page=109}}</ref> Shower and toilet cubicles rarely fitted.\n\nThe [[Volkswagen Transporter]] is a common base vehicle, and [[Ford Transit]]s are also reasonably common.\n\n=== Fixed roof (FR) ===\n\nAlso known as \"surf vans\" (or \"surf buses\") and \"day vans\". Typically similar in size to the rising roof designs. Beds usually built by moving seats and tables. Shower and toilet cubicles very rarely fitted.\n\nThe [[Volkswagen Transporter]] and [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] are particularly common base vehicles. They have become the successors to the classic Volkswagen Type 2.

Up until 1990, Irish Spring soap bars only came in one scent (known internally as \"[[Ulster]] Fragrance\"{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}), but the Colgate company has since branched out into several niche varieties and scents. Also, Irish Spring deodorants and shaving products were manufactured until the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2007, Irish Spring [[Shower gel|body wash]] was introduced.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In addition, in 2011, Irish Spring deodorant was reintroduced as part of Colgate-Palmolive's [[Speed Stick]] brand of products.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1986, the soap changed its formula, included a different scent, and added skin conditioners.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} HEJ\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:Bar_of_Irish_Spring_deodorant_soap.JPG|thumb|right|A bar of Irish Spring 'Original' soap.]]\nIrish Spring currently has nine variants:{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n*Original\n*Aloe\n*Clean Scrub\n*Clear & Fresh Skin\n*Deep Action Scrub\n*Hair & Body\n*Icy Blast\n*Intensify\n*Moisture Blast\n*Signature for Men\n\nThe following variants have been discontinued:{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n*Fresh\n*Irish Spring Deodorant Soap Microclean\u00ae with Microbeads\n*Mountain Spring\n*Reviving Mint\n*Sport\n*Vitamin\n*Waterfall Clean\n\n== Television advertisements ==\n\nTelevision advertisements for the product have usually been set in an Irish village or a forest. The product had one of the most famous slogans of the past few decades, uttered by a showering woman uttering the phrase, \"Manly, yes, but I like it too\", to describe its crossover appeal to both women and men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOther oft-used slogans included: \"Fresh and clean as a whistle\" (in which a [[wolf whistle]] was heard after \"fresh\" and before \"clean as a whistle\"), \"All the freshness of [[Ireland]] Bottled\", \"Clean a man up right\", \"The [[Irish people|Irish]] Never Quit\", and \"Smell like you're worth exploring\". Most currently, the tagline is: \"Add a little Irish to your Game\".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe television ads also featured people singing while bathing in the soap, sometimes in public and fully clothed, and a man carving off the side of the soap with a knife to reveal the soap's striped cross-section.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIrish Spring is also a sponsoring partner of [[Theonion.com|TheOnion.com]], a satirical newspaper-styled website.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe 2009 campaign focused on Irish Spring Body Wash, with the tagline: \"All the freshness of [[Ireland]] bottled\". They have a website (GetIrishNow.com) where the user can learn how to be more charming, download ringtones, get free T-shirt & bodywash giveaways, and learn more about their products.\n\nThe 2015 advertising campaign supported the new Irish Spring body wash and bar soap, Signature for Men.

Up until 1990, Irish Spring soap bars only came in one scent (known internally as \"[[Ulster]] Fragrance\"{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}), but the Colgate company has since branched out into several niche varieties and scents. Also, Irish Spring deodorants and shaving products were manufactured until the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In 2007, Irish Spring [[Shower gel|body wash]] was introduced.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In addition, in 2011, Irish Spring deodorant was reintroduced as part of Colgate-Palmolive's [[Speed Stick]] brand of products.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1986, the soap changed its formula, included a different scent, and added skin conditioners.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} HEJ\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:Bar_of_Irish_Spring_deodorant_soap.JPG|thumb|right|A bar of Irish Spring 'Original' soap.]]\nIrish Spring currently has nine variants:{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n*Original\n*Aloe\n*Clean Scrub\n*Clear & Fresh Skin\n*Deep Action Scrub\n*Hair & Body\n*Icy Blast\n*Intensify\n*Moisture Blast\n*Signature for Men\n\nThe following variants have been discontinued:{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n*Fresh\n*Irish Spring Deodorant Soap Microclean\u00ae with Microbeads\n*Mountain Spring\n*Reviving Mint\n*Sport\n*Vitamin\n*Waterfall Clean\n\n== Television advertisements ==\n\nTelevision advertisements for the product have usually been set in an Irish village or a forest. The product had one of the most famous slogans of the past few decades, uttered by a showering woman uttering the phrase, \"Manly, yes, but I like it too\", to describe its crossover appeal to both women and men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nOther oft-used slogans included: \"Fresh and clean as a whistle\" (in which a [[wolf whistle]] was heard after \"fresh\" and before \"clean as a whistle\"), \"All the freshness of [[Ireland]] Bottled\", \"Clean a man up right\", \"The [[Irish people|Irish]] Never Quit\", and \"Smell like you're worth exploring\". Most currently, the tagline is: \"Add a little Irish to your Game\".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe television ads also featured people singing while bathing in the soap, sometimes in public and fully clothed, and a man carving off the side of the soap with a knife to reveal the soap's striped cross-section.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIrish Spring is also a sponsoring partner of [[Theonion.com|TheOnion.com]], a satirical newspaper-styled website.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe 2009 campaign focused on Irish Spring Body Wash, with the tagline: \"All the freshness of [[Ireland]] bottled\".

[[Ian Smith]] remained as Prime Minister until the country became [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979.\n\n== Political system ==\n===1961 constitution===\n\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the [[unicameral]] Legislative Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a [[first past the post]] principle. At some stages, however, there were two-member constituencies, and in the early years there were some appointed members.  Under the Constitution, there was provision for the establishment of an [[upper house]] to be known as the Legislative Council, but none was ever established.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jun/22/southern-rhodesia Southern Rhodesia], ''[[Hansard]]'', HC Deb 22 June 1961 vol 642 cc1696-739</ref> The 1961 Constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\n\nAt the time of the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], Rhodesia's amended 1961 Constitution (which was annexed to the UDI) provided for an [[Officer Administering the Government]], to be appointed by Parliament if the Queen did not appoint a [[Governor-General]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vzNIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qgANAAAAIBAJ&pg=782%2C2383897 Ian Smith Strips Gibbs Of All Official Privilege], Associated Press, ''[[The Morning Record]]'', November 18, 1965</ref> Political power continued to reside with the Legislative Assembly.\n\nUnder the 1961 Constitution, the Legislative Assembly had 65 elected members: 50 constituency members and 15 district members. The voter rolls had education, property and income qualifications. The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95% of its members were white and 5% were black or Asian. The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90% of its members were black and 10% were white or Asian. The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll. Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts, but for elections in the constituencies, the B roll vote was capped at 20% of the total, and for elections in the districts, the A roll vote was capped at 20% of the total. This procedure was known as 'cross-voting'. In practice, the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\n\nThe [[Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962|1962 general election]] was a watershed for the country, since it resulted in the election of a [[Rhodesian Front]] government led by [[Winston Field]] that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia. The defeated [[United Federal Party]] led by [[Edgar Whitehead]] had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\n\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969. It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided. African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register, and those that had registered not to vote. Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote, and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25%.\n\nThe Rhodesians maintained the system was broadly fair since the 50/15 power share split reflected the relative contributions of white and black communities to the \"fisc\" (that is, the tax take). Progress to black majority rule was possible within the arrangement of the 1961 constitution as a result of advances in black wealth and education, although it would have taken some years to achieve. It would have required the black community to patiently accept an extended period of white minority rule followed by an extended period of power sharing. Black politicians in the early 1960s were not minded to accept such an arrangement. In any event, income and property qualifications for the electoral roll had become an anachronism.\n\nIan Smith and other Rhodesians claimed that this political arrangement would have resulted in an evolutionary transition to black majority rule which would have avoided the rushed transition that had caused difficulty in other African countries. But critics maintain that the stubborn refusal to make immediate and visible progress to majority rule in the early 1960s set in train events which are causing serious trouble in modern Zimbabwe to this day.\n\nIn 1965 there were revisions to the Constitution that reflected the new status of the nation after UDI. Primarily, the revisions erased the rights of the British Government to legislate and act on behalf of Rhodesia, and provided for further constitutional amendments on a two-thirds majority of parliament. The Officer Administering the Government was to be the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n===1969 (UDI) Constitution===\n\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution. This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic, following a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] result in favour in 1969. Under this new constitution, there was a [[bicameral]] Parliament consisting of an indirectly elected [[Senate of Rhodesia]], and a directly elected [[House of Assembly of Rhodesia]], in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the Constitution of 1961. The new office of [[President of Rhodesia|President]] was a ceremonial post, with executive power remaining with the [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]].\n\nThe 1969 Constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly. The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll, and 8 B roll seats. It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached. In addition to the B roll seats, the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly, with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well. \n\nThe new Constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms. The concept of \"separate development\" for blacks and whites was written into that constitution. The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted. This last feature underpinned the concept of 'equal partnership between black and white' as an alternative to majority rule. However, the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely, if not for ever. White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance, given enough time.<ref>Herald online :[http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2005/10/25/cols/hcols.htm article on UDI]</ref>\n\n== Politics in Rhodesia ==\n\nThe [[dexter]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} victory in the [[gareth general election, 1962|1962 general election]] and the subsequent UDI were in the populist tradition of Rhodesian politics.

It has been argued that the racial dimension of UDI was an incidental thing. Economic recessions in the early 1930s and the early 1960s had both produced the election of populist governments committed to securing standards of living for working people (albeit, the immediate concern was for working white people). It is significant that in the 1962 election, the RF recruited a slate of black candidates to contest the district (essentially B roll) seats. Those black RF candidates obtained little support from the B roll electorate and none were elected.<ref>[[Rhodesia general election, 1962]]</ref> \n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Smithy2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Prime Minister Ian Smith at a press conference in Salisbury, just before the end of UDI in 1979|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}]] -->\n\nRhodesia in the UDI era never quite took on the character of a one-party state. Although the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] was the real political contest, there was a conventional political opposition to the RF throughout the UDI period.\n\nThe opposition came from white liberals who would contest A roll seats in general elections and from some black parties that would contest B roll seats. The main white opposition was the Rhodesia Party, associated with veteran liberal politician (and former district Assembly member) Dr [[Ahrn Palley]].<ref>Dispatch online :[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2003/03/18/editoria/LP1.HTM Liberals in colonial Africa]</ref> In the [[Rhodesia general election, 1974|1974 general election]], Dr Palley came within 3 votes of taking Salisbury (City) from the RF. In that same election, [[Michael Auret]] took about 30% of the vote for the RP in Bulawayo (District). Auret later won Harare (Central) for the MDC in the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2000]].\n\nThe RP did manage to secure around 20% of the white vote nationally on a regular basis and it would pick up most of the non-white constituency votes, but the first-past-the-post electoral system meant that they never won seats in the Assembly. Widespread press censorship and government control of radio and TV inhibited opposition activity. The lack of an effective parliamentary opposition is one factor that made it difficult to end UDI when this measure had become clearly necessary.\n\nRP activists considered that most of their support came from the business elite, the professional class and from second or third generation Rhodesians. The more recent white immigrants tended to vote overwhelmingly for the RF. It has been suggested that Rhodesia hosted a peculiar brand of white politics traceable to British working-class immigrants who during the 20th century brought their successful struggle for a generous social welfare state out to the colonies.\n\n{{quote|My mother could not afford to pay school fees and I would not have received an education if the government of Rhodesia had not simply treated me like a special citizen and given me a free education of a very high standard.|Eddie Cross, Chairman of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industry and Economic Secretary of the Movement for Democratic Change, 2004}}\n\nThe RP group did not contest the 1977 general election because many of its activists had either been taken into one or other of various forms of detention or had been forced into exile. Michael Auret was expelled from Rhodesia in 1976 and told that he would be arrested immediately if he returned.<ref>Southern Cross:[http://www.thesoutherncross.co.za/features/auret.htm 2002 interview with Michael Auret] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424092334/http://www.thesoutherncross.co.za/features/auret.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}</ref> Auret was unable to return home until 1980. The Rhodesian government was never tolerant of dissent throughout the UDI period, but it became positively repressive as the final debacle approached.

K. van der Byl]], variously Minister of Information, then Defence and then Foreign Affairs in the Rhodesian Government. A key figure in loss of South African support for Rhodesia (photo by W Higham)]] -->\nThe final political events in white Rhodesia were the 1977 general election and the 1979 referendum on extending equal voting rights to all citizens. An extreme right wing group known as the [[Rhodesian Action Party]] ('RAP') opposed the RF in the election and campaigned for a No vote in the referendum. The RAP group favoured a continuation of white minority rule and undertaking extreme military measures to win the Bush War. RAP attracted significant electoral support (15% of the referendum vote).\n\nSome non-militant black groups and individuals contested and won B roll seats (often under the title \"ANC Independent\"). Under the 1969 constitution, the B roll was reserved exclusively for non-Europeans. This black political grouping was one of those that participated in the 1979 'internal settlement'. Association with the UDI state and with the internal settlement carried a collaborationist stigma that would damage the credibility of the black politicians involved.\n\n== The end of Rhodesia  ==\n\nWhen white minority rule was no longer tenable, Rhodesia moved first to a form of power sharing ('the internal settlement') and then to majority rule. At this point Rhodesia ceased to exist as a political entity and was replaced by Zimbabwe.\n\nThe end of UDI and of the Bush War were associated with an abrupt transfer of power to the insurgent backed, black political parties in 1980. Some observers feel that this resulted in some of the more stable elements in black civil society being marginalised. Consequently, Zimbabwe was not able to enjoy benefits of a managed transfer to democracy of the kind that took place in comparable neighbouring countries such as [[Botswana]] and South Africa.\n\n== References  ==\n\n*Results of Rhodesian and Zimbabwean elections [http://africanelections.tripod.com/zw.html]\n*[[Elections in Rhodesia]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Politics of Rhodesia| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Politics of Rhodesia}}\n:''This article relates to Southern Rhodesia up to 1964 and Rhodesia thereafter.

Those black RF candidates obtained little support from the B roll electorate and none were elected.<ref>[[Rhodesia general election, 1962]]</ref> \n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Smithy2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Prime Minister Ian Smith at a press conference in Salisbury, just before the end of UDI in 1979|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}]] -->\n\nRhodesia in the UDI era never quite took on the character of a one-party state. Although the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] was the real political contest, there was a conventional political opposition to the RF throughout the UDI period.\n\nThe opposition came from white liberals who would contest A roll seats in general elections and from some black parties that would contest B roll seats. The main white opposition was the Rhodesia Party, associated with veteran liberal politician (and former district Assembly member) Dr [[Ahrn Palley]].<ref>Dispatch online :[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2003/03/18/editoria/LP1.HTM Liberals in colonial Africa]</ref> In the [[Rhodesia general election, 1974|1974 general election]], Dr Palley came within 3 votes of taking Salisbury (City) from the RF. In that same election, [[Michael Auret]] took about 30% of the vote for the RP in Bulawayo (District). Auret later won Harare (Central) for the MDC in the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2000]].\n\nThe RP did manage to secure around 20% of the white vote nationally on a regular basis and it would pick up most of the non-white constituency votes, but the first-past-the-post electoral system meant that they never won seats in the Assembly. Widespread press censorship and government control of radio and TV inhibited opposition activity. The lack of an effective parliamentary opposition is one factor that made it difficult to end UDI when this measure had become clearly necessary.\n\nRP activists considered that most of their support came from the business elite, the professional class and from second or third generation Rhodesians. The more recent white immigrants tended to vote overwhelmingly for the RF. It has been suggested that Rhodesia hosted a peculiar brand of white politics traceable to British working-class immigrants who during the 20th century brought their successful struggle for a generous social welfare state out to the colonies.\n\n{{quote|My mother could not afford to pay school fees and I would not have received an education if the government of Rhodesia had not simply treated me like a special citizen and given me a free education of a very high standard.|Eddie Cross, Chairman of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industry and Economic Secretary of the Movement for Democratic Change, 2004}}\n\nThe RP group did not contest the 1977 general election because many of its activists had either been taken into one or other of various forms of detention or had been forced into exile. Michael Auret was expelled from Rhodesia in 1976 and told that he would be arrested immediately if he returned.<ref>Southern Cross:[http://www.thesoutherncross.co.za/features/auret.htm 2002 interview with Michael Auret] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424092334/http://www.thesoutherncross.co.za/features/auret.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}</ref> Auret was unable to return home until 1980. The Rhodesian government was never tolerant of dissent throughout the UDI period, but it became positively repressive as the final debacle approached. The liberal former Prime Minister [[Garfield Todd]] and members of his family were subject to various forms of detention and house arrest.\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Pk1.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[P. K. van der Byl]], variously Minister of Information, then Defence and then Foreign Affairs in the Rhodesian Government. A key figure in loss of South African support for Rhodesia (photo by W Higham)]] -->\nThe final political events in white Rhodesia were the 1977 general election and the 1979 referendum on extending equal voting rights to all citizens. An extreme right wing group known as the [[Rhodesian Action Party]] ('RAP') opposed the RF in the election and campaigned for a No vote in the referendum. The RAP group favoured a continuation of white minority rule and undertaking extreme military measures to win the Bush War. RAP attracted significant electoral support (15% of the referendum vote).\n\nSome non-militant black groups and individuals contested and won B roll seats (often under the title \"ANC Independent\"). Under the 1969 constitution, the B roll was reserved exclusively for non-Europeans. This black political grouping was one of those that participated in the 1979 'internal settlement'. Association with the UDI state and with the internal settlement carried a collaborationist stigma that would damage the credibility of the black politicians involved.\n\n== The end of Rhodesia  ==\n\nWhen white minority rule was no longer tenable, Rhodesia moved first to a form of power sharing ('the internal settlement') and then to majority rule. At this point Rhodesia ceased to exist as a political entity and was replaced by Zimbabwe.\n\nThe end of UDI and of the Bush War were associated with an abrupt transfer of power to the insurgent backed, black political parties in 1980. Some observers feel that this resulted in some of the more stable elements in black civil society being marginalised. Consequently, Zimbabwe was not able to enjoy benefits of a managed transfer to democracy of the kind that took place in comparable neighbouring countries such as [[Botswana]] and South Africa.\n\n== References  ==\n\n*Results of Rhodesian and Zimbabwean elections [http://africanelections.tripod.com/zw.html]\n*[[Elections in Rhodesia]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Politics of Rhodesia| ]]\n", "name_user": "GoingBatty", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Rhodesia (disambiguation), 1 to be fixed -Dexter/WP:WCWproject (Missing end bold/italic)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Rhodesia"}

After the death of [[Gerard van Papenbroek]], his [[Papenbroek Collection|collection]] was bequeathed to [[Leiden University]]. The bequest comprised about 150 antiquities and was published in 1746 by a professor of the university. It was put on public display but poorly cared for until half a century later when it would finally get an official curator.<ref>Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 20</ref> This curator was classicist Dr. [[Caspar Reuvens]], the world's first [[archaeology]] professor. Along with his duties as a professor at the university came the care of the archaeological cabinet, then consisting mainly of the Papenbroek inheritance.\n\nReuvens quickly added other collections from both within and outside Leiden to the university's antiquities.<ref>Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 34-43</ref> Antiquities from the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]] were transferred to Leiden with government support in 1825. Some pieces from the [[Thoms Collection]] were among the favorites of the director of the Amsterdam museum. It was agreed that these would not be moved to Leiden until after his directorship. These became part of the Leiden collection in 1844. In 1826, a collection of prehistorical materials arrived from the Museum of Natural History.\n\n===The contributions of Rottiers===\nThe growth of the National Museum of Antiquities would prove to be depended much more upon foreign investments. Despite the gathering of antiquities from various Dutch organizations, the really important additions to the museum would come from buying personal collections. Among the first of these was the first [[Rottiers Collection]]. It belonged to a retired Flemish colonel who had begun collecting during a stay in [[Athens]]. In 1820, this collection was offered to the government of the Low Countries and Reuvens was sent to determine its value and recommend on whether to buy or not. Reuvens was enthusiastic about the collection because it contained original Greek sculpture and Greek pottery, categories which lacked in the Leiden collection until then. Cautioning the ministry not to buy at any price, the Rottiers collection was eventually sold for the sum of 12,000 guilders and placed in the National Museum of Antiquities.\n\nIn 1822, Rottiers sold a second collection, of smaller importance, to the government. The best piece in this collection would later turn out to be a modern cast of a marble head, a forgery. With both the first and the second Rottiers collections, the origins would remain shady. In both cases it was hinted or outright claimed that Rottiers and his son had dug up at least part of the antiquities themselves. However, in both cases it would turn out that perhaps all of the collection was bought. Rottiers also repeatedly admitted to selling forgeries and misleading buyers, but told Reuvens that he would never do so to him and that his earlier mistakes were youthful folly.\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, Rottiers made a journey through the Mediterranean, paid for by the ministry. This journey was Rottiers' own idea, and the purpose of it was to buy antiquities. Reuvens, who was not very enthusiastic about this project, was asked to provide Rottiers with instructions. During these travels Rottiers complained a lot, and for a while failed to produce any real results. The ministry had to go as far as send him an official warning to stop using government funds for anything other than buying antiquities. Plans of Rottiers' to start his own excavations were never discussed with Reuvens, and eventually Rottiers actually excavated on [[Melos]]. After this excavation Rottiers continued his travels and bought antiquities. During a lengthy stay on [[Rhodes]], he studied and described the medieval architecture, large parts of which would later be destroyed, making the drawings commissioned by Rottiers invaluable.\n\nIn March and September 1826, the museum received the acquired antiquities. Reuvens wrote a largely negative report. Though he was pleased with some of the pieces, most were hardly special and Rottiers had not provided substantial background information.<ref>Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 67-70</ref>\n\n===The contributions of Humbert===\nRottiers was not the only agent working for the Dutch government procuring antiquities however. While Rottiers was working in the eastern Mediterranean, [[Jean Emile Humbert]] was collecting and excavating in [[Tunisia]]. After selling his personal collection to the government, Humbert was asked to return to Tunisia on an archaeological expedition. Raised to the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], with instructions from Reuvens and with a state-funded budget Humbert would collect and excavate antiquities in Tunisia from 1822 to 1824. Most important about this first expedition by Humbert was the acquisition of eight statues, which are still on display as centerpieces in the museum.\n\nA second expedition by Humbert never reached Tunisia because Humbert preferred staying in Italy. Despite this blatant disregard of the agreements, the expedition did produce some considerable results. A collection of [[Etruscan society|Etruscan]] artifacts, known as the ''Museo Corazzi'', was bought for over 30.000 guilders but pleased Reuvens because Etruscan antiquities were virtually unknown outside Italy at the time. \nBy far the most important deal of the expedition was the acquisition of the very large d'Anastasy Collection of Egyptian antiquities. After a lengthy period of negotiations by the Dutch ambassador in Rome and Humbert with agents of d'Anastasy the collection was eventually sold for roughly 115.000 guilders. It would be the largest deal in the careers of Humbert and Reuvens both, and provided the museum with an internationally appraised Egyptian collection.\n\n===Death of Reuvens===\nIn the final years of Reuvens' life, there was a severe decline in governmental support for the museum. The rebellion and seceding of Belgium in 1830 were costly matters for the king, and little to no room was found for adventurous expeditions or excavations.\nReuvens died in 1835, after suffering what seems to be a severe stroke by the reports.<ref>Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 142-3</ref> He left behind a young museum with a scholarly renowned collection, which had grown from the Papenbroek inheritance to now include a large amount of Etruscan, Egyptian, Carthaginian, Roman, Greek and other items.\n\n===Leemans takes over===\nAfter his death, Reuvens' work was taken over by his student, [[Conradus Leemans]], who had excavated with Reuvens and was present at his death. As described below, under Leemans, the museum would finally get its own building. Prospects for continuing the growth of the collection looked bleak, however, after royal interest waned and with the enormous cost of the d'Anastasy deal still in mind. Leemans found a solution by using the official gazette to appeal private collectors, Dutch ambassadors and consuls for donations and aid in building the collection. The appeal was successful and objects from all over the world kept flowing in.\n\nIn 1839, Leemans, now appointed director, bought some 100 vases with funds from the king. They belonged to a collection that had been excavated a decade before in Italy and belonged to Lucien Bonaparte. Leemans published this collection in 1840 and had published the Egyptian collection the year before. The Etruscan collection was published by a colleague. Publications would continue and the next period in the history of the museum is described as \"a period of consolidation after the restless pioneer years\".<ref>Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 152</ref>\n\n==History of the housing==\n===Before and under Reuvens===\nFinding an adequate building for the archaeological collection had been a matter of ongoing strife between Reuvens, the trustees of the museum and the Dutch government. When Reuvens was first appointed professor of archaeology, and thereby curator of the Papenbroek collection, the antiquities were housed in a building of the botanical gardens of the university. The damp atmosphere caused serious damage to the sculptures, however, and the collection had already outgrown its housing which resulted in several statues being placed outside.\n\nIn 1821, the archaeological cabinet was moved to a new wing of the Museum of Natural History. Reuvens was unhappy with this location as well though, because it was much too small for the growing collection and because the windows provided far from enough light. In 1824, Reuvens was offered some more room of the Museum of Natural History, but Reuvens refused the insufficient extra space and proposed an entirely new building designed especially for the National Museum of Antiquities, which would also give him a lecture hall, restoration facilities and other required rooms. Reuvens plans for this new building would prove much too expensive unfortunately.\n\nThe collection continued growing however and the room granted to it was obviously insufficient. Several other solutions were sought, including redecorating a medieval church and giving Reuvens part of a new academy building. Reuvens refused these options however, because they weren't real solutions. This led to considering a much more drastic plan: moving the museum altogether to another city. [[Brussels]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[the Hague]] were considered. Reuvens argued against all of these, using Leiden's thriving academic climate in the humanities as a main argument for keeping the collection there. Eventually, Amsterdam became the prime candidate, being the capital of the Netherlands and Brussels having seceded from the kingdom along with the rest of Belgium. Before the relocation could begin however, the academic world was shocked by the unexpected death of the still young Reuvens.\n\n===Under Leemans===\nReuvens' student, Conrad Leemans, was appointed temporary curator of the collection and was asked to compile reports on the state of the museum and Reuvens' intended publications. Leemans followed Reuvens in complaining about the poor state of the antiquities due to limited finances and a poor housing. In November 1835, a turning event occurred for the museum when the university bought an 18th-century mansion and offered to place the collection there. Leemans set to work in redecorating the mansion and moving the collection to the new building. Budgetary problems and the difficulties of transporting some of the largest pieces through the city were eventually overcome and, in August 1838, the National Museum of Antiquities finally had its official opening for the public. Reuvens' collection had grown to a real museum.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Temple of Taffeh]]\n* [[Caspar Reuvens]]\n* [[Jean Emile Humbert]]\n* [[Leiden University]]\n* [[Papenbroek Collection]]\n* [[Rottiers Collection]]\n* [[Thoms Collection]]\n* Papyrus of [[Qenna]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n\n* Halbertsma, R.

Several other solutions were sought, including redecorating a medieval church and giving Reuvens part of a new academy building. Reuvens refused these options however, because they weren't real solutions. This led to considering a much more drastic plan: moving the museum altogether to another city. [[Brussels]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[the Hague]] were considered. Reuvens argued against all of these, using Leiden's thriving academic climate in the humanities as a main argument for keeping the collection there. Eventually, Amsterdam became the prime candidate, being the capital of the Netherlands and Brussels having seceded from the kingdom along with the rest of Belgium. Before the relocation could begin however, the academic world was shocked by the unexpected death of the still young Reuvens.\n\n===Under Leemans===\nReuvens' student, Conrad Leemans, was appointed temporary curator of the collection and was asked to compile reports on the state of the museum and Reuvens' intended publications. Leemans followed Reuvens in complaining about the poor state of the antiquities due to limited finances and a poor housing. In November 1835, a turning event occurred for the museum when the university bought an 18th-century mansion and offered to place the collection there. Leemans set to work in redecorating the mansion and moving the collection to the new building. Budgetary problems and the difficulties of transporting some of the largest pieces through the city were eventually overcome and, in August 1838, the National Museum of Antiquities finally had its official opening for the public. Reuvens' collection had grown to a real museum.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Temple of Taffeh]]\n* [[Caspar Reuvens]]\n* [[Jean Emile Humbert]]\n* [[Leiden University]]\n* [[Papenbroek Collection]]\n* [[Rottiers Collection]]\n* [[Thoms Collection]]\n* Papyrus of [[Qenna]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n\n* Halbertsma, R.
