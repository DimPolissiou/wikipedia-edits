{"title_page": "Dungeon Hills", "text_new": "[[File:Dungeon Hills.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\nThe '''Dungeon Hills''' are a range of hills in the [[Galloway Hills]] range, part of the [[Southern Uplands]] of [[Scotland]]. The central of three parallel ridges, they are neighboured by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] to the west and the [[Rhinns of Kells]] to the east. The range is also perpendicular to the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range, immediately south. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the smallest and craggiest of the Galloway Hills with the highest, Mullwharchar, reaching 692m. They are split between [[East Ayrshire]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] along the Mullwharchar-Dungeon Hill col, following the Pulskaig Burn. Often regarded as the roughest hills in the Southern Uplands, walks can frequently take longer than anticipated due to the underfoot conditions of tussocks and bog. The range is the most remote of the Galloway Hills as the nearest road link to the north is approximately 2 miles away at Craigmalloch on the banks of Loch Doon, requiring an approach along an unclassified road. <ref>https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/loch-doon-castle/getting-here/</ref> As a result, many hillwalkers begin their walk at the Glentrool Visitor Centre to the southwest and follow the path past [[Loch Trool]] to then ascend opposite the Gairland Burn and eventually to [[Loch Valley]] and [[Loch Neldricken]]. A longer but initially easier path can be followed from the same start point, following the path to the [[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]], but cutting right at Culsharg bothy and following the Buchan Burn to Loch Enoch for a clockwise round instead.\n\nFrom north to south the hills are: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
