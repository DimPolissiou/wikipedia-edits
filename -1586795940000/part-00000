Established on 10 October 1845, under [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[George Bancroft]], it is the second oldest of the five [[United States service academies|U.S. service academies]], and educates officers for training known as \"C.O.C.K. Indoctrination\" and the [[United States Marine Corps]]. The {{convert|338|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} campus is located on the former grounds of [[Fort Severn]] at the confluence of the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], {{convert|33|mi|km|0}} east of Washington, D.C. and {{convert|26|mi|km|0|}} southeast of [[Baltimore]]. The entire campus (known to insiders as \"the Yard\") is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and home to many historic sites, buildings, and monuments. It replaced [[Philadelphia Naval Asylum]], in [[Philadelphia]], that served as the first United States Naval Academy from 1838 to 1845 when the Naval Academy formed in Annapolis.<ref name=toll>{{cite web|url=http://www.navalsquare.com/historic.html|title=History Meets Modern Luxury|author=Toll Brothers|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215124855/http://www.navalsquare.com/historic.html|archivedate=15 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCandidates for admission generally must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination, usually from a [[United States Congress|Member of Congress]]. Students are officers-in-training and are referred to as midshipmen. Tuition for [[midshipmen]] is fully funded by the Navy in exchange for an active duty service obligation upon graduation. Approximately 1,200 \"plebes\" (an abbreviation of the Ancient Roman word ''[[plebeian]]'') enter the Academy each summer for the rigorous [[Plebe Summer]]. About 1,000 midshipmen graduate. Graduates are usually [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as [[Ensign (rank)|ensigns]] in the Navy or [[second lieutenant]]s in the Marine Corps, but a small number can also be cross-commissioned as officers in other U.S. services, and the services of allied nations. The United States Naval Academy has some of the highest paid graduates in the country according to starting salary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Colleges with the highest-paid grads|url=http://money.cnn.com/gallery/pf/college/2014/09/10/higest-paid-graduates/2.html|website=CNN|date=10 September 2014}}</ref> The academic program grants a bachelor of science degree with a curriculum that grades midshipmen's performance upon a broad academic program, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics.

Due to his zeal and perseverance, the \"Nautical School\" was opened on board the frigate [[USS Guerriere (1814)|Guerriere]] on 3 Dec 1821 with between 40 and 50 midshipmen attached to the ship. The curriculum was diversified with Naval Tactics, Astronomy, Geography, French, History, English Grammar, and International Relations.

Miller. Benjamin states:<ref>{{cite book|title=The United States naval academy, being the yarn of the American midshipman, Naval Cadet|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924030752434|first=Park|last=Benjamin|location=New York and London|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|year=1900|page=349|quote=The whole is the design of the author, and was adopted by the Navy Department in 1898. Up to that year, the naval academy had possessed no authorized device, although it had printed on its registers an arbitrary symbol. The occasion which led to the adoption of the present design was the building of a new club-house by the University Club of New York, on the exterior of which the coats-of-arms of the several colleges were placed as an embellishment, and this brought the fact to general notice that the naval academy had no badge of the kind. The matter was at once taken up by Mr. Jacob W. Miller, of the class of 1867, and mainly through his endeavors the desired approval of the Navy Department was secured.}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The seal or coat-of-arms of the Naval Academy has for its crest a hand grasping a trident, below which is a shield bearing an ancient galley coming into action, bows on, and below that an open book, indicative of education, and finally bears the motto, 'Ex Scientia Tridens' (From knowledge, sea power).</blockquote>\n\nThe [[trident]], [[emblem]] of the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], represents seapower.{{needsref|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Early years===\nThe institution was founded as the Naval School on 10 October 1845 by [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[George Bancroft]]. The campus was established at [[Annapolis]] on the grounds of the former U.S. Army post [[Fort Severn]]. The school opened with 50 midshipman students and seven professors. The decision to establish an academy on land may have been in part a result of the {{USS|Somers|1842|2}} Affair, an alleged mutiny involving the Secretary of War's son that resulted in his execution at sea. [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] had a considerable interest in naval education, supporting an apprentice system to train new seamen, and helped establish the curriculum for the United States Naval Academy. He was also a vocal proponent of modernization of the navy.\n\nOriginally a course of study for five years was prescribed. Only the first and last were spent at the school with the other three being passed at sea. The present name was adopted when the school was reorganized in 1850 and placed under the supervision of the chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography. Under the immediate charge of the superintendent, the course of study was extended to seven years with the first two and the last two to be spent at the school and the intervening three years at sea. The four years of study were made consecutive in 1851 and practice cruises were substituted for the three consecutive years at sea. The first class of naval academy students graduated on 10 June 1854. They were considered as [[passed midshipmen]] until 1912, when graduates were first sworn in as officers.<ref name=greatwar>{{Cite journal |first=Jim |last=Cheevers  |year=2018 |title=The U.S. Naval Academy during the Great War |journal=Shipmate |volume=81 |issue=7 |pages=34\u201340}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, the [[Tripoli Monument]] was moved to the academy grounds. Later that year in August, the model of the USS ''Somers'' experiment was resurrected when {{USS|Constitution}}, then 60 years old, was recommissioned as a school ship for the fourth-class midshipmen after a conversion and refitting begun in 1857. She was anchored at the yard, and the plebes lived on board the ship to immediately introduce them to shipboard life and experiences.<ref name=\"Conrad, p.6\">{{harvnb|Conrad|2003|p=6}}</ref>\n\n===The American Civil War===\nThe [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was disruptive to the Naval Academy. Southern sympathy ran high in Maryland. Although riots broke out, Maryland did not declare secession. The United States government was planning to move the school, when the sudden outbreak of hostilities forced a quick departure. Almost immediately the three upper classes were detached and ordered to sea, and the remaining elements of the academy were transported to [[Fort Adams]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] by the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] in April 1861, where the academy was set up in temporary facilities and opened in May.<ref name=1860s>{{cite book|last1=Duchesneau |first1=John T|first2=Kathleen |last2=Troost-Cramer|title=Fort Adams: A History|date=2014|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-62619-528-8|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucyTAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA36&dq=%22benjamin%20k.%20pierce%22%20%22fort%20adams%22&pg=PA44}}</ref> The Annapolis campus, meanwhile, was turned into a United States Army Hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.joshualawrencechamberlain.com/annapolis.php|title=Echoes from Life In Camp}}</ref>\n[[File:USNA-Constitution&Santeelate1860s.jpg|thumb|right|US Naval Academy waterfront in the late 1860s with the barrack/school ships USS ''Constitution'' and ''Santee'' tied up in the back ground.

Lieutenant [[William Harwar Parker]], CSN, class of 1848, and instructor at USNA, joined the [[Virginia State Navy]], and then went on to become the superintendent of the Confederate States Naval Academy.\n\nLieutenant Charles \"Savez\" Read may have been \"anchor man\" (graduated last) in the class of 1860, but his later service to the Confederate States Navy included defending New Orleans, service on CSS ''Arkansas'' and CSS ''Florida'', and command of a series of captured Union ships that culminated in seizing the US Revenue Cutter ''Caleb Cushing'' in Portland, Maine. Lieutenant [[James Iredell Waddell]], CSN, a former instructor at the US Naval Academy, commanded the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']]. \nThe midshipmen and faculty returned to Annapolis in the summer of 1865, just after the war ended.\n\n===Porter's Academy - From the Civil War to the Spanish\u2013American War===\n[[File:David Dixon Porter - Mathew Brady's National Photographic Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[David Dixon Porter]]]]\nCivil War hero Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] became superintendent in 1865.

He concentrated on recruiting naval officers as opposed to civilians, a change of philosophy. He recruited teachers Stephen B.

Swimming was among a set of other qualifications that a pilot candidate must have passed before being accepted to aviation duty.  Pilot qualifications were in accordance with Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) standards.  In the presence of a committee of the Aero Club of America, a pilot candidate had to fly five figure eights around two flags buoyed 1500 feet apart then land within 150 feet of an established mark.  This course had to be completed twice.  The test also required the prospective aviator to climb to a minimum altitude of 150 ft (officially 50 meters).

It was presented to the Academy by the Class of 1891. This bust, one of the most famous relics on the campus, is commonly known as [[Tecumseh]]. However, when it adorned the American man-of-war, it commemorated not Tecumseh but [[Tamanend]], the revered Delaware chief who welcomed William Penn to America. The original wooden figurehead is in the Naval Academy fieldhouse. In times past, the bronze replica was considered a good-luck \"mascot\" for the midshipmen, who threw pennies at it and offered left-handed salutes whenever they wanted a 'favor', such as a sports win over West Point, spiritual help for examinations. It is also referred to as the god of 2.0 because 2.0 is the minimum passing GPA at USNA, and the mids offer pennies to Tecumseh to help achieve this. Today it is used as a morale booster during football weeks and on special occasions when Tecumseh is painted in themes to include super heroes, action heroes, humorous figures, a leprechaun (before Saint Patrick's Day) and a naval officer (during Commissioning Week).\n* [[Battle ensign]]s. Famous flags of the U.S. Navy and captured flags from enemy ships are displayed throughout the academy. The most famous, perhaps, is the \"Don't Give Up the Ship\" flag flown by Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] on 10 September 1813; it bears the dying words of Captain [[James Lawrence]], captain of the [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|USS ''Chesapeake'']]. It was displayed in Memorial Hall, which is in the portion of [[Bancroft Hall]] open to the general public until 2004.

The civilian professors nearly all have a PhD and can be awarded [[tenure]], usually upon promotion from assistant professor to [[associate professor]]. Fewer of the military instructors have a PhD but nearly all have a master's degree. Most of them are assigned to the Academy for only two or three years. Additionally, there are [[adjunct professor]]s, hired to fill temporary shortages in various disciplines. The Adjunct Professors are not eligible for tenure.\n\n;Permanent Military Professors (PMP)\nA small number of officers at the Academy are designated as Permanent Military Professors (PMP), initially at the academic rank of Assistant Professor. All PMPs have PhDs, and remain at the Academy until statutory retirement. Most are commanders in the Navy; a few are captains. Like civilian professors, they seek academic promotion to the rank of Associate Professor and Professor. However, they are not eligible for tenure.\n\n;Distinguished Visiting Professorships:\n''The Class of 1957 Distinguished Chair of Naval Heritage'' is an academic professorial chair in the History Department.<ref>McMullen Seapower Symposium Program for 2013</ref> In order to preserve and promote a better understanding of professional naval heritage in midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy, the Academy's Class of 1957 donated the funds to permanently endow this position.

Currently each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. When any appointee graduates or otherwise leaves the academy, a vacancy is created. Candidates are nominated by their senator, representative, or delegate in Congress, and those appointed at large are nominated by the Vice President. The applicants do not have to know their Congressman to be nominated. Congressmen generally nominate ten people per vacancy. They can nominate people in a competitive manner, or they can have a principal nomination. In a competitive nomination, all ten applicants are reviewed by the academy, to see who is the most qualified. If the congressman appoints a principal nominee, then as long as that candidate is physically, medically, and academically found qualified by the academy, he or she will be admitted, even if there are more qualified applicants. The degree of difficulty in obtaining a nomination varies greatly according to the number of applicants in a particular state. The process of obtaining a nomination typically consists of completing an application, completing one or more essays, and obtaining one or more letters of recommendation and often requires an interview either in person or over the phone. These requirements are set by the respective senator or representative and are in addition to the USNA application.<ref name=\"USNAA apps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/steps4.htm|title=Apply For Nomination|year=2009|publisher=United States Naval Academy|accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy may appoint 170 enlisted members of the Regular and Reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year. Additional sources of appointment are open to children of career military personnel (100 per year) and 65 appointments are available to children of military members who were killed in action, or were rendered 100% disabled due to injuries received in action, or are currently prisoners of war or missing in action. Typically five to ten candidates are nominated for each appointment, which are normally awarded competitively; candidates who do not receive the appointment they are competing for may still be admitted to the Academy as a qualified alternate. If a candidate is considered qualified but not picked up, they may receive an indirect admission to either a Naval Academy Foundation prep school or the [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]; the following year, these candidates enlist in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] (or, in the case of prior enlisted members, remain in the Navy) and are eligible for [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] nominations, which are granted as a matter of course. To receive an appointment to the Naval Academy, students at the Naval Academy Preparatory School must first pass with a 2.2 QPA (a combination of GPA and Fitness Assessments), although this is waiverable. A candidate must also receive a recommendation for appointment from the Commanding Officer. The appointment process has been criticized as giving preferential treatment towards athletes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/opinion/21fleming.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The Academies' March Toward Mediocrity |date=20 May 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bruce |last=Fleming}}</ref>\n\nChildren of [[Medal of Honor]] recipients are automatically appointed to the Naval Academy; they only need to meet admission requirements.<ref name=2005-2005admissions/>\n\n===Admissions requirements===\nTo be admitted, candidates must be between seventeen and twenty-three years of age upon entrance, unmarried with no children, and of good moral character.

Candidates for admission must also undergo a physical aptitude test (the CFA or Candidate Fitness Assessment [formerly the Physical Readiness Examination]) as well as a complete physical exam including a separate visual acuity test to be eligible for appointment. A medical waiver will automatically be sought on behalf of candidates with less than 20/20 vision, as well as a range of other injuries or illnesses.

In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law an act of Congress providing for the Bachelor of Science Degree for the Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies. The Class of 1933 was the first to receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, an act of Congress extended to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy the authority to award the Bachelor of Science degree to all living graduates.

However, midshipmen are allowed to confront someone they see violating the code without formally reporting it. It is believed that this method is a better way of developing the honor of midshipmen as opposed to the non-toleration clauses of the other service academies and is a better way of building honor and trust.\n\nBrigade Honor Committees composed of upper-class midshipmen are responsible for the education and training of the Honor Concept.

The Voluntary Graduate Education Program (VGEP) allows the midshipman to begin his studies the second semester of his senior year at a local university, usually [[University of Maryland]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Georgetown University]], or [[George Washington University]], and complete the degree by the following semester. Midshipmen accepted into prestigious scholarships, such as the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] are permitted to complete their studies before fulfilling their service obligation. Finally, the Bowman Scholarship allows Navy Nuclear Power candidates to complete their master's degrees at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] before continuing into the Navy.\n\n==Student activities==\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Main|Navy Midshipmen}}\n{{See also|Navy Midshipmen men's basketball|Navy Midshipmen football|Navy Midshipmen men's lacrosse|Navy Midshipmen men's soccer}}\n[[File:1926 Navy National Championship Team.JPG|thumb|The 1926 National Championship football team]]\n\nParticipation in athletics is, in general, mandatory at the Naval Academy and most midshipmen not on an [[college athletics|intercollegiate]] team must participate actively in [[intramural sports|intramural]] or club sports.

It is also sung in most companies by the plebes at the conclusion of the day during Plebe Summer and end of the week during the academic year; this event is also referred to as \"Blue and Gold,\" which is a short gathering to review the day for better or worse with the upperclass midshipmen. The original lyrics are:\n\n{{quote box\n|align=center\n|width=85%\n|{{poemquote|'''Blue and Gold'''\nNow college men from sea to sea may sing of colors true,\nBut who has better right than we, to hoist a symbol hue,\nFor sailor men in battle fair, since fighting days of old,\nHave proved the sailor's right to wear, the Navy Blue and Gold!}}\n}}\n\n:The second verse is sung at each graduation and commissioning ceremony and is often performed by the Glee Clubs.\n\n{{quote box\n|align=center\n|width=85%\n|{{poemquote|Four years together by the bay where [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn]] joins the tide,\nAnd by the service called away we scatter far and wide.\nBut still when two or three shall meet and old tales be retold,\nFrom low to highest in the Fleet, we'll pledge the Blue and Gold!}}\n}}\n\n:The wording of the first and third lines was changed slightly in 2004 to make them gender neutral.

The imaginary character narrating the poem assumes the role of a wise senior officer offering advice to the junior officers of the wardroom on the appropriate attitudes to have and the appropriate way to behave aboard a ship, delivered in the form of twenty-seven \"laws.\" The uninitiated should understand that \"law\" is entirely poetical and analogous, and that the \"laws\"  are not and never were part of any regulatory code in or out of any of the world's navies. Furthermore, the advice is of little import in the operation and management of real ships in the real navy. That being so, the outsider might well wonder what is the point of making a tradition of the poem. It is in fact one of a number of set pieces used as an exercise in memory training, much as schoolboys in Britain sometimes memorize Macaulay's ''Horatius at the Bridge''. Most of the other set pieces are totally whimsical, such as \"Sir, sir, is a subservient word surviving from the surly days in old Serbia, when certain serfs,  ...\", etc. Since these exercises are memorized by all midshipmen, they serve as a unifying common heritage of Academy culture. The poem was composed by Rear Admiral [[Ronald Arthur Hopwood|Ronald Hopwood]], Royal Navy, originally appearing in the ''Army and Navy Gazette'', 23 July 1896.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://history.navy.mil/photos/arttopic/titles/law-navy.htm | first=RA | last=Hopwood | title=The Laws of the Navy | publisher=Department of the Navy \u2013 Naval Historical Center | url-status=unfit | archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130503185151/http%3A//www.history.navy.mil/photos/arttopic/titles/law-navy.htm | archivedate=3 May 2013 | accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> By the mid-1920s the poem began to be published in the USNA's ''Reef Points'', the official midshipman handbook and training manual issued to all plebes during their induction.<ref group=note>Reef points on a sailing vessel are short pieces of line used to tie the bottom of the mainsail to the boom or spar so as to shorten the sail during a storm, diminishing the force on it and helping it to get through the gale without breakage of sail or mast.

The war on paper could well be waged in poetry, he felt, for it at least kept the mind higher. The older and more senior he became, the more would he try to lighten the mood of his cohorts by humor in prose and poetry, though the latter, many said, became increasingly atrocious the more elevated its author's naval rank.

Adjuncts to the tunnels lead underground to the basement levels of Michelson Hall, Chauvenet Hall, and Rickover Hall. The tunnels serve as a natural infiltration route for midshipman pranks, especially during the week leading up to the Army-Navy football game.

Up to that year, the naval academy had possessed no authorized device, although it had printed on its registers an arbitrary symbol. The occasion which led to the adoption of the present design was the building of a new club-house by the University Club of New York, on the exterior of which the coats-of-arms of the several colleges were placed as an embellishment, and this brought the fact to general notice that the naval academy had no badge of the kind.

The campus was established at [[Annapolis]] on the grounds of the former U.S. Army post [[Fort Severn]]. The school opened with 50 midshipman students and seven professors. The decision to establish an academy on land may have been in part a result of the {{USS|Somers|1842|2}} Affair, an alleged mutiny involving the Secretary of War's son that resulted in his execution at sea. [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] had a considerable interest in naval education, supporting an apprentice system to train new seamen, and helped establish the curriculum for the United States Naval Academy. He was also a vocal proponent of modernization of the navy.\n\nOriginally a course of study for five years was prescribed. Only the first and last were spent at the school with the other three being passed at sea. The present name was adopted when the school was reorganized in 1850 and placed under the supervision of the chief of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography. Under the immediate charge of the superintendent, the course of study was extended to seven years with the first two and the last two to be spent at the school and the intervening three years at sea. The four years of study were made consecutive in 1851 and practice cruises were substituted for the three consecutive years at sea. The first class of naval academy students graduated on 10 June 1854. They were considered as [[passed midshipmen]] until 1912, when graduates were first sworn in as officers.<ref name=greatwar>{{Cite journal |first=Jim |last=Cheevers  |year=2018 |title=The U.S. Naval Academy during the Great War |journal=Shipmate |volume=81 |issue=7 |pages=34\u201340}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, the [[Tripoli Monument]] was moved to the academy grounds. Later that year in August, the model of the USS ''Somers'' experiment was resurrected when {{USS|Constitution}}, then 60 years old, was recommissioned as a school ship for the fourth-class midshipmen after a conversion and refitting begun in 1857.

Southern sympathy ran high in Maryland. Although riots broke out, Maryland did not declare secession. The United States government was planning to move the school, when the sudden outbreak of hostilities forced a quick departure. Almost immediately the three upper classes were detached and ordered to sea, and the remaining elements of the academy were transported to [[Fort Adams]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] by the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']] in April 1861, where the academy was set up in temporary facilities and opened in May.<ref name=1860s>{{cite book|last1=Duchesneau |first1=John T|first2=Kathleen |last2=Troost-Cramer|title=Fort Adams: A History|date=2014|publisher=The History Press|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=978-1-62619-528-8|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucyTAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA36&dq=%22benjamin%20k.%20pierce%22%20%22fort%20adams%22&pg=PA44}}</ref> The Annapolis campus, meanwhile, was turned into a United States Army Hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.joshualawrencechamberlain.com/annapolis.php|title=Echoes from Life In Camp}}</ref>\n[[File:USNA-Constitution&Santeelate1860s.jpg|thumb|right|US Naval Academy waterfront in the late 1860s with the barrack/school ships USS ''Constitution'' and ''Santee'' tied up in the back ground.

Lieutenant [[William Harwar Parker]], CSN, class of 1848, and instructor at USNA, joined the [[Virginia State Navy]], and then went on to become the superintendent of the Confederate States Naval Academy.\n\nLieutenant Charles \"Savez\" Read may have been \"anchor man\" (graduated last) in the class of 1860, but his later service to the Confederate States Navy included defending New Orleans, service on CSS ''Arkansas'' and CSS ''Florida'', and command of a series of captured Union ships that culminated in seizing the US Revenue Cutter ''Caleb Cushing'' in Portland, Maine. Lieutenant [[James Iredell Waddell]], CSN, a former instructor at the US Naval Academy, commanded the [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']]. \nThe midshipmen and faculty returned to Annapolis in the summer of 1865, just after the war ended.\n\n===Porter's Academy - From the Civil War to the Spanish\u2013American War===\n[[File:David Dixon Porter - Mathew Brady's National Photographic Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[David Dixon Porter]]]]\nCivil War hero Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] became superintendent in 1865.

Swimming was among a set of other qualifications that a pilot candidate must have passed before being accepted to aviation duty.  Pilot qualifications were in accordance with Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) standards.  In the presence of a committee of the Aero Club of America, a pilot candidate had to fly five figure eights around two flags buoyed 1500 feet apart then land within 150 feet of an established mark.  This course had to be completed twice.  The test also required the prospective aviator to climb to a minimum altitude of 150 ft (officially 50 meters).

It was presented to the Academy by the Class of 1891. This bust, one of the most famous relics on the campus, is commonly known as [[Tecumseh]]. However, when it adorned the American man-of-war, it commemorated not Tecumseh but [[Tamanend]], the revered Delaware chief who welcomed William Penn to America. The original wooden figurehead is in the Naval Academy fieldhouse. In times past, the bronze replica was considered a good-luck \"mascot\" for the midshipmen, who threw pennies at it and offered left-handed salutes whenever they wanted a 'favor', such as a sports win over West Point, spiritual help for examinations. It is also referred to as the god of 2.0 because 2.0 is the minimum passing GPA at USNA, and the mids offer pennies to Tecumseh to help achieve this. Today it is used as a morale booster during football weeks and on special occasions when Tecumseh is painted in themes to include super heroes, action heroes, humorous figures, a leprechaun (before Saint Patrick's Day) and a naval officer (during Commissioning Week).\n* [[Battle ensign]]s. Famous flags of the U.S. Navy and captured flags from enemy ships are displayed throughout the academy.

The civilian professors nearly all have a PhD and can be awarded [[tenure]], usually upon promotion from assistant professor to [[associate professor]]. Fewer of the military instructors have a PhD but nearly all have a master's degree. Most of them are assigned to the Academy for only two or three years. Additionally, there are [[adjunct professor]]s, hired to fill temporary shortages in various disciplines. The Adjunct Professors are not eligible for tenure.\n\n;Permanent Military Professors (PMP)\nA small number of officers at the Academy are designated as Permanent Military Professors (PMP), initially at the academic rank of Assistant Professor. All PMPs have PhDs, and remain at the Academy until statutory retirement. Most are commanders in the Navy; a few are captains. Like civilian professors, they seek academic promotion to the rank of Associate Professor and Professor.

Currently each member of Congress and the Vice President can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. When any appointee graduates or otherwise leaves the academy, a vacancy is created. Candidates are nominated by their senator, representative, or delegate in Congress, and those appointed at large are nominated by the Vice President. The applicants do not have to know their Congressman to be nominated. Congressmen generally nominate ten people per vacancy. They can nominate people in a competitive manner, or they can have a principal nomination. In a competitive nomination, all ten applicants are reviewed by the academy, to see who is the most qualified. If the congressman appoints a principal nominee, then as long as that candidate is physically, medically, and academically found qualified by the academy, he or she will be admitted, even if there are more qualified applicants. The degree of difficulty in obtaining a nomination varies greatly according to the number of applicants in a particular state. The process of obtaining a nomination typically consists of completing an application, completing one or more essays, and obtaining one or more letters of recommendation and often requires an interview either in person or over the phone. These requirements are set by the respective senator or representative and are in addition to the USNA application.<ref name=\"USNAA apps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/steps4.htm|title=Apply For Nomination|year=2009|publisher=United States Naval Academy|accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy may appoint 170 enlisted members of the Regular and Reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year. Additional sources of appointment are open to children of career military personnel (100 per year) and 65 appointments are available to children of military members who were killed in action, or were rendered 100% disabled due to injuries received in action, or are currently prisoners of war or missing in action. Typically five to ten candidates are nominated for each appointment, which are normally awarded competitively; candidates who do not receive the appointment they are competing for may still be admitted to the Academy as a qualified alternate. If a candidate is considered qualified but not picked up, they may receive an indirect admission to either a Naval Academy Foundation prep school or the [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]; the following year, these candidates enlist in the [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] (or, in the case of prior enlisted members, remain in the Navy) and are eligible for [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] nominations, which are granted as a matter of course. To receive an appointment to the Naval Academy, students at the Naval Academy Preparatory School must first pass with a 2.2 QPA (a combination of GPA and Fitness Assessments), although this is waiverable. A candidate must also receive a recommendation for appointment from the Commanding Officer. The appointment process has been criticized as giving preferential treatment towards athletes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/opinion/21fleming.html?pagewanted=1 |title=The Academies' March Toward Mediocrity |date=20 May 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=Bruce |last=Fleming}}</ref>\n\nChildren of [[Medal of Honor]] recipients are automatically appointed to the Naval Academy; they only need to meet admission requirements.<ref name=2005-2005admissions/>\n\n===Admissions requirements===\nTo be admitted, candidates must be between seventeen and twenty-three years of age upon entrance, unmarried with no children, and of good moral character.

Candidates for admission must also undergo a physical aptitude test (the CFA or Candidate Fitness Assessment [formerly the Physical Readiness Examination]) as well as a complete physical exam including a separate visual acuity test to be eligible for appointment. A medical waiver will automatically be sought on behalf of candidates with less than 20/20 vision, as well as a range of other injuries or illnesses.

In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law an act of Congress providing for the Bachelor of Science Degree for the Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies. The Class of 1933 was the first to receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, an act of Congress extended to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy the authority to award the Bachelor of Science degree to all living graduates.

However, midshipmen are allowed to confront someone they see violating the code without formally reporting it. It is believed that this method is a better way of developing the honor of midshipmen as opposed to the non-toleration clauses of the other service academies and is a better way of building honor and trust.\n\nBrigade Honor Committees composed of upper-class midshipmen are responsible for the education and training of the Honor Concept.

However, a number of programs allow midshipmen to obtain graduate degrees before fulfilling their service obligation. The Immediate Graduate Education Program (IGEP) allows newly commissioned Ensigns or Second Lieutenants to proceed directly to graduate school and complete a master's degree. The Voluntary Graduate Education Program (VGEP) allows the midshipman to begin his studies the second semester of his senior year at a local university, usually [[University of Maryland]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Georgetown University]], or [[George Washington University]], and complete the degree by the following semester. Midshipmen accepted into prestigious scholarships, such as the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] are permitted to complete their studies before fulfilling their service obligation. Finally, the Bowman Scholarship allows Navy Nuclear Power candidates to complete their master's degrees at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] before continuing into the Navy.\n\n==Student activities==\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Main|Navy Midshipmen}}\n{{See also|Navy Midshipmen men's basketball|Navy Midshipmen football|Navy Midshipmen men's lacrosse|Navy Midshipmen men's soccer}}\n[[File:1926 Navy National Championship Team.JPG|thumb|The 1926 National Championship football team]]\n\nParticipation in athletics is, in general, mandatory at the Naval Academy and most midshipmen not on an [[college athletics|intercollegiate]] team must participate actively in [[intramural sports|intramural]] or club sports.

Many have been recorded over the years in academy publications. Some are as old as a century or more but few have persisted totally unchanged.\n* ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]'' is a popular song written historically at the Naval Academy, subsequently coming to stand for the entire United States Navy. The lyrics are by Midshipman Alfred H. Miles, set to music by 2nd Lieutenant [[Charles A. Zimmermann|Zimmerman]], USMC, bandmaster of the Naval Academy Band starting in 1887. After writing \"Anchors Aweigh\" they dedicated it to the Class of 1907. The song is sung during sporting events, pep rallies, and played by the Drum and Bugle Corps during noon meal formations. Members of the Navy and Marine Corps, unless marching, are supposed to come to attention while it is playing. The original verse (quoted below) is learned by midshipmen as plebes.\n\n{{quote box\n|align=center\n|width=60%\n|{{poemquote|'''Anchors Aweigh'''\nStand Navy down the field \nSails set to the sky\nWe'll never change our course\nSo Army you steer shy-y-y-y\nRoll up the score, Navy\nAnchors Aweigh\nSail Navy down the field \nAnd sink the Army, sink the Army Grey!<ref name=anchors>{{cite web | title=Anchors Aweigh | website=Naval Academy Band | publisher=USNA | url=https://www.usna.edu/USNABand/history/anchors.php | accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>}}\n}}\n\n* \"Beat Army\" is a stock phrase, most often said in the autumn before the [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army-Navy Football Game]] to which it refers. It is generally used in a traditional or ad hoc authoritative context, such as after the singing of the Academy's Alma Mater, \"Blue and Gold,\" at a rally. As an example of an ad hoc context, midshipmen officers with the approval of commanding officers may require it to be spoken smartly by plebes while squaring corners.\n* \"[[Navy Blue and Gold|Blue and Gold]]\" is the name of Naval Academy's [[Alma mater (song)|Alma Mater]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The song is sung at the conclusion of every sporting event, at the end of pep rallies and at alumni gatherings. It is also sung in most companies by the plebes at the conclusion of the day during Plebe Summer and end of the week during the academic year; this event is also referred to as \"Blue and Gold,\" which is a short gathering to review the day for better or worse with the upperclass midshipmen. The original lyrics are:\n\n{{quote box\n|align=center\n|width=85%\n|{{poemquote|'''Blue and Gold'''\nNow college men from sea to sea may sing of colors true,\nBut who has better right than we, to hoist a symbol hue,\nFor sailor men in battle fair, since fighting days of old,\nHave proved the sailor's right to wear, the Navy Blue and Gold!}}\n}}\n\n:The second verse is sung at each graduation and commissioning ceremony and is often performed by the Glee Clubs.\n\n{{quote box\n|align=center\n|width=85%\n|{{poemquote|Four years together by the bay where [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn]] joins the tide,\nAnd by the service called away we scatter far and wide.\nBut still when two or three shall meet and old tales be retold,\nFrom low to highest in the Fleet, we'll pledge the Blue and Gold!}}\n}}\n\n:The wording of the first and third lines was changed slightly in 2004 to make them gender neutral.

Various additional practices have included putting a small sum of money inside the cover for the benefit of children attending, or putting one's name and address inside to receive a letter and cake. The Cover Toss tradition started in 1912.\n* ''Goat Court''<ref name=\"gloss\"/> refers to either of two light wells inside the third and fourth wings of Bancroft, lined with five stories of room windows. The bottoms, forming a roof over the basement, feature large HVAC units. Policies of assignment to the more desirable, outside rooms have varied, but generally rank is the chief consideration.\n* ''[[Herndon Monument]] Climb'' \u2013 a year-end informal ritual (analogous to the \"cover toss\" at graduation) marking the passage from plebe to third-classman.

The imaginary character narrating the poem assumes the role of a wise senior officer offering advice to the junior officers of the wardroom on the appropriate attitudes to have and the appropriate way to behave aboard a ship, delivered in the form of twenty-seven \"laws.\" The uninitiated should understand that \"law\" is entirely poetical and analogous, and that the \"laws\"  are not and never were part of any regulatory code in or out of any of the world's navies. Furthermore, the advice is of little import in the operation and management of real ships in the real navy. That being so, the outsider might well wonder what is the point of making a tradition of the poem. It is in fact one of a number of set pieces used as an exercise in memory training, much as schoolboys in Britain sometimes memorize Macaulay's ''Horatius at the Bridge''. Most of the other set pieces are totally whimsical, such as \"Sir, sir, is a subservient word surviving from the surly days in old Serbia, when certain serfs,  ...\", etc. Since these exercises are memorized by all midshipmen, they serve as a unifying common heritage of Academy culture. The poem was composed by Rear Admiral [[Ronald Arthur Hopwood|Ronald Hopwood]], Royal Navy, originally appearing in the ''Army and Navy Gazette'', 23 July 1896.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://history.navy.mil/photos/arttopic/titles/law-navy.htm | first=RA | last=Hopwood | title=The Laws of the Navy | publisher=Department of the Navy \u2013 Naval Historical Center | url-status=unfit | archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130503185151/http%3A//www.history.navy.mil/photos/arttopic/titles/law-navy.htm | archivedate=3 May 2013 | accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> By the mid-1920s the poem began to be published in the USNA's ''Reef Points'', the official midshipman handbook and training manual issued to all plebes during their induction.<ref group=note>Reef points on a sailing vessel are short pieces of line used to tie the bottom of the mainsail to the boom or spar so as to shorten the sail during a storm, diminishing the force on it and helping it to get through the gale without breakage of sail or mast.

The war on paper could well be waged in poetry, he felt, for it at least kept the mind higher. The older and more senior he became, the more would he try to lighten the mood of his cohorts by humor in prose and poetry, though the latter, many said, became increasingly atrocious the more elevated its author's naval rank. Still it served its purpose admirably. As a junior officer it was a way to cloak his ideas in a patina of genteel wardroom horseplay, with the barb of criticism perfunctorily covered.|Capt. Edward L. Beach, USN<ref name=beach388/>}}\n\n:In later years Salty Sam led the enlightenment of Sims through ''The Log'' at USNA. Salty Sam reflects the spirit of Sims by questioning today's paradigms to ready the Navy for the future. The secret and anonymous tradition of Salty Sam is to teach Midshipman to bridle criticism in the ways of Sims humor, but to seek to inspire change and reform through the argument of the obvious.\n* The ''Steam Tunnels'', also later known as the ''Ho Chi Minh trail''<ref name=\"gloss\"/> are a network of underground brick-encased tunnels carrying steam pipes from the old Isherwood Hall, named after [[Benjamin F. Isherwood]] who served as the Engineer-in-Chief of the Navy during the [[American Civil War]]. The pipes carried steam to Bancroft Hall and Mahan Hall, primarily for heating the buildings. Adjuncts to the tunnels lead underground to the basement levels of Michelson Hall, Chauvenet Hall, and Rickover Hall. The tunnels serve as a natural infiltration route for midshipman pranks, especially during the week leading up to the Army-Navy football game. The original Isherwood Hall was located partially under the current Alumni hall and behind Mahan Hall toward the Nimitz Library. The Steam Plant was located under the front left of Rickover Hall and plaza, in the middle of the current {{convert|300|ft}} tow-tank. The Steam Tunnels were left in place after Isherwood Hall was demolished.\n\n==Alumni==\n{{Main|List of United States Naval Academy alumni|List of Medal of Honor recipients educated at the United States Naval Academy}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Notable people\">\nFile:JimmyCarterPortrait2.jpg|[[Jimmy Carter]]\nFile:JeremiahDentonSenate.jpg|[[Jeremiah Denton]]\nFile:GeoDewey.jpg|[[George Dewey]]\nFile:Heinlein-face.jpg|[[Robert A.

NH-66 mainly traverses through the west coast of India, sometimes touching the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]]. The NH66 touches the Arabian Sea at [[Maravanthe]] in Karnataka, [[Thalassery]], [[Alappuzha]] and [[Kollam]] in Kerala.

The lack of dividers has led to an increased incidence of head-on collisions between vehicles. At some places, signboards indicating left or right turns, speed-breakers, etc. are either damaged or missing. In addition to its narrow span, there are no guard railings along the sides of the highway. The sides of the road are at times at a lower level than the road.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-08/mumbai/31037385_1_mumbai-goa-nh-17-nh-4|title = Travelers forsake risky Goa road|accessdate= 2012-08-03 |publisher=www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}</ref> Due to heavy human settlement around the highway and narrow span, the average speed on this highway is far lesser than what can be attained on comparatively better highways such as NH3, NH4 or NH8. One can find carcasses of animals on the road, indicating the risk of inattentive animals coming into the road. Two-wheel vehicles must take a special note of this. The road surface is uneven at certain stretches, not just in rainy seasons, but even at other times.\n\nAt certain places in Karnataka, the surface is so badly damaged that the iron rods underneath are exposed. Presently, the work on widening this highway has been undertaken at certain stretches. Due to narrow span and lack of dividers, there are no separate lanes for oncoming traffic, driving and passing (over-taking). As a result, over-taking is quite rampant. At times, motorists attempt over-taking even on curves where the oncoming traffic cannot be seen. Other motorists are advised to be on the lookout for such oncoming vehicles.\n\nOn 19 March 2013 a bus carrying over 50 persons fell off a bridge close to a river in the Khed area of Ratnagiri district. 37 people were killed in the incident.\n\nThe highway in the state of Karnataka is being upgraded to a 60-metre-wide grade separated highway, in which vehicles can travel at a speed of 100&nbsp;km per hour. It is a major overhaul, in which certain bridges are being constructed as six-lane bridges for the smooth movement of traffic. The widening work is going on in the complete stretch from the Goa border to the Kerala border. The stretch between Suratkal (NITK) to Kankanady cross (Mahavir Circle) has been already converted to four lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newsid=221517&newstype=local|title=BC Road- Suratkal four laning to be completed by June|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=www.mangalorean.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222060828/http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newsid=221517&newstype=local|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The four-lane stretch between Surathkal and Coondaapur is under progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/81208/restrict-4-lane-road-widening.html|title =Restrict four lane widening to 45 metres|accessdate= 2012-08-03 |publisher=www.deccanherald.com}}</ref>\n\n== Connectivity ==\n\nPrior to the building of National Highway 66 (NH 66), then known as National Highway 17 (NH17), in the 1960s and 1970s, ships and steamers running between [[Mumbai]] and [[Mangalore]] calling at different ports were the only means of transport along the west coast of India adjoining the Arabian Sea. These ship services were abandoned later. The NH 66 connects the interior parts of the coastal regions with the rest of the country. The NH 66 connects the major sea ports of West India, Mumbai, [[JNPT]] at Nhava Sheva, Mormugao ([[Mormugao#Mormugao Port|MPT]]), New Mangalore ([[NMPT]]), [[International Container Transshipment Terminal, Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] [[Vizhinjam International Seaport|Vizhinjam Port]] and [[Ratnagiri]] Port and other important ports like [[Beypore|Beypore Port]] and [[Kollam Port]].\n\nHence this National Highway 66 allows for the movement of goods by trucks (lorries) from the hinterland to the major sea ports of India. Trade and commerce in the region have increased due to the expansion of markets for agricultural products and seafood produced in the region connected by this highway. The formation of NH 66 has led to the development of tourism in the region connected by this highway. Goa state is a classic example of this development. Many industries have been set up along National Highway 66, taking advantage of connectivity and proximity to ports on the Arabian Sea. The highway was the only source of connection between areas in the coastal districts, until the [[Konkan Railway]] was opened in 1998, between Mumbai and Mangalore.\n\nOne can still find old number NH-17 written on boards of shops and other establishments along NH-66 highway even in the year 2017 A.D.\n\n==Major cities and places on the highway==\n===Maharashtra state===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Panvel]] || [[Pen, India|Pen]] || [[Nagothana|Nagothane]] || [[Kolad]] INDAPUR\n\n| [[Mahad]] || [[Mangaon]] || [[Poladpur]] ||\n|-\n|[[Khed, Ratnagiri|Khed]] || [[Chiplun]] || [[Sangameshwar]] || [[Ratnagiri|Hatkhamba]] || [[Lanja]] || [[Rajapur, Maharashtra|Rajapur]] || \n|- \n| [[Kankavli]] ||[[Kudal]]|| [[Sawantwadi]] || [[Sindhudurg]] || [[Banda, Maharashtra|Banda]]\n|}\n\n===Goa state===\n[[File:NH17 Goa.jpg|thumb|right|NH-66 in Goa]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Pernem]] || [[Mapusa]] || [[Panjim]]\n|-\n| [[Margao]] || [[Cuncolim]] || [[Canacona]]\n|}\n\n===Karnataka state===\n[[Uttara Kannada]] District\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Karwar]] || [[Ankola]] || [[Kumta]] \n|-\n|[[Honnavar]] || [[Murudeshwar]] || [[Bhatkal]] \n|}\n \n[[Dakshina Kannada]] (Udupi and Mangaluru District)\n[[File:Highway 17 at Uttara Kannada.jpg|thumb|right|NH-66 in Karnataka]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Baindur]] || [[Bijjur]] || [[Maravanthe]] || [[Kundapur]]\n|-\n| [[Saligrama]] || [[Brahmavar]] || [[Udupi]] || [[Kapu, Karnataka|Kapu]] || [[Padubidre]]\n|-\n| [[Mulki, Karnataka|Mulki]] || [[Suratkal]] || [[Mangaluru]] || [[Ullal]]\n|}\n\n===Kerala state===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Kasaragod Town|Kasaragod]] || [[Kannur]]\n|- \n| [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mahe (Puducherry UT)]] || [[Kozhikode]]\n|- \n|Thrissur\n|-\n| [[Kochi]] || [[Alappuzha]]\n|-\n| [[Kollam]] || [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n|}\n\n===Tamilnadu state===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n| [[Nagercoil]] \n| [[Kanyakumari]]\n\n|}\n\n==Major city/town bypass roads on the highway==\n* [[Thiruvananthapuram]] Bypass - [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kollam Bypass]] - [[Kollam]] city, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kochi Bypass]] - [[Kochi]] city, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kodungallur bypass|Kodungallur Bypass]] - [[Kodungallur]] town, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kozhikode]] Bypass - [[Kozhikode]] city, [[Kerala]]\n*Sawantwadi  Bypass - Sawantwadi-Banda Section - Maharastra\n\n== Lifestyle along NH 66 ==\nNH 66 passes through hills, forests, rivers, rivulets, and streams, generally flowing westwards towards the Arabian Sea. Most of the region has typical scenes like [[coconut]] trees dotted all along with [[paddy field]]s and [[arecanut]] gardens. The road is uneven, and bumps, curves, steep rises and narrow paths in between hillocks are found all over this highway. As this region experiences heavy rainfall, potholes are abundant.\n\nAlthough the languages spoken vary along the highway, the food of the people along the NH 66 has some common ingredients like coconut, chili, pepper, coconut oil, and fish.

The lack of dividers has led to an increased incidence of head-on collisions between vehicles. At some places, signboards indicating left or right turns, speed-breakers, etc. are either damaged or missing. In addition to its narrow span, there are no guard railings along the sides of the highway. The sides of the road are at times at a lower level than the road.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-08/mumbai/31037385_1_mumbai-goa-nh-17-nh-4|title = Travelers forsake risky Goa road|accessdate= 2012-08-03 |publisher=www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}</ref> Due to heavy human settlement around the highway and narrow span, the average speed on this highway is far lesser than what can be attained on comparatively better highways such as NH3, NH4 or NH8. One can find carcasses of animals on the road, indicating the risk of inattentive animals coming into the road. Two-wheel vehicles must take a special note of this. The road surface is uneven at certain stretches, not just in rainy seasons, but even at other times.\n\nAt certain places in Karnataka, the surface is so badly damaged that the iron rods underneath are exposed. Presently, the work on widening this highway has been undertaken at certain stretches. Due to narrow span and lack of dividers, there are no separate lanes for oncoming traffic, driving and passing (over-taking). As a result, over-taking is quite rampant. At times, motorists attempt over-taking even on curves where the oncoming traffic cannot be seen. Other motorists are advised to be on the lookout for such oncoming vehicles.\n\nOn 19 March 2013 a bus carrying over 50 persons fell off a bridge close to a river in the Khed area of Ratnagiri district. 37 people were killed in the incident.\n\nThe highway in the state of Karnataka is being upgraded to a 60-metre-wide grade separated highway, in which vehicles can travel at a speed of 100&nbsp;km per hour. It is a major overhaul, in which certain bridges are being constructed as six-lane bridges for the smooth movement of traffic. The widening work is going on in the complete stretch from the Goa border to the Kerala border. The stretch between Suratkal (NITK) to Kankanady cross (Mahavir Circle) has been already converted to four lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newsid=221517&newstype=local|title=BC Road- Suratkal four laning to be completed by June|accessdate=2012-08-03|publisher=www.mangalorean.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222060828/http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newsid=221517&newstype=local|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The four-lane stretch between Surathkal and Coondaapur is under progress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/81208/restrict-4-lane-road-widening.html|title =Restrict four lane widening to 45 metres|accessdate= 2012-08-03 |publisher=www.deccanherald.com}}</ref>\n\n== Connectivity ==\n\nPrior to the building of National Highway 66 (NH 66), then known as National Highway 17 (NH17), in the 1960s and 1970s, ships and steamers running between [[Mumbai]] and [[Mangalore]] calling at different ports were the only means of transport along the west coast of India adjoining the Arabian Sea. These ship services were abandoned later. The NH 66 connects the interior parts of the coastal regions with the rest of the country. The NH 66 connects the major sea ports of West India, Mumbai, [[JNPT]] at Nhava Sheva, Mormugao ([[Mormugao#Mormugao Port|MPT]]), New Mangalore ([[NMPT]]), [[International Container Transshipment Terminal, Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] [[Vizhinjam International Seaport|Vizhinjam Port]] and [[Ratnagiri]] Port and other important ports like [[Beypore|Beypore Port]] and [[Kollam Port]].\n\nHence this National Highway 66 allows for the movement of goods by trucks (lorries) from the hinterland to the major sea ports of India. Trade and commerce in the region have increased due to the expansion of markets for agricultural products and seafood produced in the region connected by this highway. The formation of NH 66 has led to the development of tourism in the region connected by this highway. Goa state is a classic example of this development. Many industries have been set up along National Highway 66, taking advantage of connectivity and proximity to ports on the Arabian Sea. The highway was the only source of connection between areas in the coastal districts, until the [[Konkan Railway]] was opened in 1998, between Mumbai and Mangalore.\n\nOne can still find old number NH-17 written on boards of shops and other establishments along NH-66 highway even in the year 2017 A.D.\n\n==Major cities and places on the highway==\n===Maharashtra state===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Panvel]] || [[Pen, India|Pen]] || [[Nagothana|Nagothane]] || [[Kolad]] INDAPUR \n\n| [[Mahad]] || [[Mangaon]] || [[Poladpur]] ||\n|-\n|[[Khed, Ratnagiri|Khed]] || [[Chiplun]] || [[Sangameshwar]] || [[Ratnagiri|Hatkhamba]] || [[Lanja]] || [[Rajapur, Maharashtra|Rajapur]] || \n|- \n| [[Kankavli]] ||[[Kudal]]|| [[Sawantwadi]] || [[Sindhudurg]] || [[Banda, Maharashtra|Banda]]\n|}\n\n===Goa state===\n[[File:NH17 Goa.jpg|thumb|right|NH-66 in Goa]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Pernem]] || [[Mapusa]] || [[Panjim]]\n|-\n| [[Margao]] || [[Cuncolim]] || [[Canacona]]\n|}\n\n===Karnataka state===\n[[Uttara Kannada]] District\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Karwar]] || [[Ankola]] || [[Kumta]] \n|-\n|[[Honnavar]] || [[Murudeshwar]] || [[Bhatkal]] \n|}\n \n[[Dakshina Kannada]] (Udupi and Mangaluru District)\n[[File:Highway 17 at Uttara Kannada.jpg|thumb|right|NH-66 in Karnataka]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Baindur]] || [[Bijjur]] || [[Maravanthe]] || [[Kundapur]]\n|-\n| [[Saligrama]] || [[Brahmavar]] || [[Udupi]] || [[Kapu, Karnataka|Kapu]] || [[Padubidre]]\n|-\n| [[Mulki, Karnataka|Mulki]] || [[Suratkal]] || [[Mangaluru]] || [[Ullal]]\n|}\n\n===Kerala state===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[Kasaragod Town|Kasaragod]] || [[Kannur]]\n|- \n| [[Mah\u00e9, India|Mahe (Puducherry UT)]] || [[Kozhikode]]\n|- \n|Thrissur\n|-\n| [[Kochi]] || [[Alappuzha]]\n|-\n| [[Kollam]] || [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n|}\n\n===Tamilnadu state===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n| [[Nagercoil]] \n| [[Kanyakumari]]\n\n|}\n\n==Major city/town bypass roads on the highway==\n* [[Thiruvananthapuram]] Bypass - [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kollam Bypass]] - [[Kollam]] city, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kochi Bypass]] - [[Kochi]] city, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kodungallur bypass|Kodungallur Bypass]] - [[Kodungallur]] town, [[Kerala]]\n* [[Kozhikode]] Bypass - [[Kozhikode]] city, [[Kerala]]\n\n*Sawantwadi  Bypass - Sawantwadi-Banda Section - Maharastra\n\n== Lifestyle along NH 66 ==\nNH 66 passes through hills, forests, rivers, rivulets, and streams, generally flowing westwards towards the Arabian Sea. Most of the region has typical scenes like [[coconut]] trees dotted all along with [[paddy field]]s and [[arecanut]] gardens. The road is uneven, and bumps, curves, steep rises and narrow paths in between hillocks are found all over this highway. As this region experiences heavy rainfall, potholes are abundant. \n\nAlthough the languages spoken vary along the highway, the food of the people along the NH 66 has some common ingredients like coconut, chili, pepper, coconut oil, and fish.

informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms. Its historical background, growth and community life |first=Tello J. |last=D'Ap\u00e9ry| publisher= Magee Press| location=Philadelphia| year=1936| page=4| url=http://www.phillyh2o.org/backpages/PDFs_Misc/OverbrookFarms_Apery_1936.pdf#page=23}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built its main line during the early 19th century as part of the [[Main Line of Public Works]] that spanned Pennsylvania. Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]]. As such, communities west along the Main Line to Thorndale or even as far west as Parkesburg are considered to be a part of the Main Line.\n\n==Demographics==\nThere is no collective data for the Main Line, so all data is by [[ZIP code]]. In comparison, the median family income and home price for the state of Pennsylvania are $68,646 and $155,000, respectively.<ref>[http://www.brainyzip.com BrainyZip]</ref><ref>[http://www.zip-codes.com Zip-codes.com]</ref> The following ZIP codes are those within the previously mentioned municipalities that make up the Main Line.

Society, William Morrison Collection'')|279x279px]]\n\nThe '''Philadelphia Main Line''', known simply as the '''Main Line''', is an informally delineated historical and [[Social class in the United States|social]] region of suburban [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  Lying along the former [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s once prestigious [[Main Line (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Main Line]], it runs northwest from Center City Philadelphia parallel to [[Lancaster Avenue]] ([[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]]).\n\nThe railroad first connected the Main Line towns in the 19th century. They became home to sprawling [[Estate (land)#United States|country estate]]s belonging to Philadelphia's wealthiest families, and over the decades became a bastion of \"[[old money]]\". Today, the Main Line includes some of the wealthiest communities in the country, including [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/moneymag/1007/gallery.best_places_top_earning_towns.moneymag/5.html |title=Top-Earning Towns |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> [[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]], and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=America\u2019s Richest Zip Codes 2011|url=http://images.businessweek.com/slideshows/20111206/america-s-richest-zip-codes-2011#slide23}}</ref> Today, the railroad is [[Amtrak]]'s [[Keystone Corridor]], along which [[SEPTA]]'s [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] operates.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Wayne-Station-Pennsylvania-08.27.2010.jpg|279x279px|thumb|[[Wayne (SEPTA station)|Wayne Station]] on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale line after renovations in 2010]]\n\nThe Main Line region was long part of [[Lenapehoking]], the homeland of the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] [[Lenni Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (the \"true people\", or \"Delaware Indians\"). Europeans [[European colonization of the Americas|arrived]] in the 1600s, after [[William Penn]] sold a tract of land, called the [[Welsh Tract]], to a group of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in London in 1681. This accounts for the many Welsh place names in the area.<ref>{{cite book| title=Overbrook Farms.

Later in the century, the railroad, which owned much of the land surrounding the tracks, encouraged the development of this picturesque environment by building [[train station|way stations]] along the portion of its track closest to Philadelphia. The benefits of what was touted as \"healthy yet cultivated country living\" attracted Philadelphia's social [[American upper class|elite]], many of whom had one house in the city and another larger \"country home\" on the Main Line.\n\nIn the 20th century, many wealthy Philadelphia families moved to the Main Line suburbs. Part of the national trend of suburbanization, this drove rapid investment, prosperity, and growth that turned the area into greater Philadelphia's most affluent and fashionable region. Estates with sweeping lawns and towering maples, the [[d\u00e9butante]] balls and the [[Merion Cricket Club]], which drew crowds of 25,000 spectators to its matches in the early 1900s, were the setting for the 1940 [[Cary Grant|Grant]]/[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]]/[[James Stewart|Stewart]] motion picture ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]].''<ref>Fodor's Philadelphia & the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, 16th Edition (Fodor's Gold Guides), New York, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe railroad placed stops about two minutes apart, starting with Overbrook. The surrounding communities became known by the railroad station names which started at [[Broad Street Station (Philadelphia)|Broad Street Station]] in Center City Philadelphia and went on to 32nd Street Station (replaced by 30th Street Station in 1933), and then the Main Line stations: [[Overbrook_station|Overbrook]], [[Merion_station|Merion]], [[Narberth_station_(SEPTA)|Narberth]], [[Wynnewood Station|Wynnewood]], [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania (Amtrak station)|Ardmore]], [[Haverford station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|Haverford]], [[Bryn Mawr (SEPTA Regional Rail station)|Bryn Mawr]], [[Rosemont_station_(SEPTA)|Rosemont]], [[Villanova Station|Villanova]], [[Radnor_station_(SEPTA_Regional_Rail)|Radnor]], [[St._Davids_station|St. Davids]], [[Wayne_station|Wayne]], [[Strafford (SEPTA station)|Strafford]], [[Devon_station|Devon]], [[Berwyn (SEPTA station)|Berwyn]], [[Daylesford_station|Daylesford]], and [[Paoli Station|Paoli]].  At least five of these station buildings, along with the first Bryn Mawr Hotel, were designed by [[Wilson Brothers & Company]]. Broad Street Station was replaced with [[Suburban Station]] in 1930, and [[30th Street Station]] replaced 32nd Street three years later. Suburban service now extends west of the Main Line to the communities of Malvern, Exton, Whitford, Downingtown, and Thorndale.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/January-2008/COVER-STORY/|title=Where the Tracks Lie|author=Jim Waltzer|date=January 2008|magazine=Main Line Today|accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe railroad line then continued on to [[Chicago]], with major stations at [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The railroad, since taken over by [[Amtrak]], is still in service, although its route is slightly different from the original. It also serves the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]] of the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] Regional Rail system.<ref name=\"mainlinetoday\" />\n\n==Demographics of the Gilded Age==\nIt was not only extremely wealthy people on the Main Line in the period 1880-1920. Wealthy households required large numbers of servants in order to maintain their lifestyle. Often these servants were Black migrants from the South and recent immigrants from Europe. For example, in the 1900 census<ref>1900 census: Tredyffrin, Chester, Pennsylvania</ref>, Tredyffrin Township was 13.5% Black; another 15% had been born in Europe. The two largest countries of origin were Italy and Ireland. The corresponding figures for Lower Merion Township<ref>1900 census: Lower Merion, Montgomery, Pennsylvania</ref> were 6% Black and 15% born in Europe; almost 11% were from Ireland.\n\nAnother dimension of this story is illustrated by the community of Mount Pleasant, in Tredyffrin Township just north of Wayne. This is a community that became predominantly Black in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <ref>https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v12/v12n1p002.html\n</ref> As shown in the census for 1920<ref>US Census, 1920, Enumeration District 78, Tredyffrin, Eastern Precinct, Chester County, Pennsylvania</ref>, most of the Black residents of this neighborhood or their parents had come from the South. Many of the men in this neighborhood (along Henry Avenue and Mount Pleasant Avenue) were employed by the railroad, as quarry workers, or as chauffeurs and gardeners by private families. The occupations often given for women were cook and laundress. This remains a predominantly Black community to the present day.\n\n==The Main Line today==\n[[File:MilePostRadnor.JPG|thumb|Memorial [[Milestone|mile post]] on [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 30]], in front of the Anthony Wayne Theater with AT&T tower in background.|277x277px]]\n\nToday, the \"Main Line\" is another name for the western suburbs of Philadelphia along [[U.S. Route 30 in Pennsylvania|Lancaster Avenue (U.S. Route 30)]] and the former Pennsylvania Railroad Main Line, extending from the city limits to, traditionally, Bryn Mawr and ultimately [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]],<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/phillynrhs/prr.html Philly NRHS \u2013 PRR History]</ref> an area of about {{convert|200|sqmi|km2}}. The upper- and upper middle-class enclave has historically been one of the bastions of \"[[old money]]\" in the Northeast, along with places like Long Island's [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]], [[Westchester County, New York]], [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]].\n\nNeighborhoods along the Main Line include nineteenth and early twentieth-century [[Streetcar suburb#Railroad Suburbs|railroad suburbs]] and post-war subdivisions, as well as a few surviving buildings from before the suburban development era.\n\n==Communities on the Main Line==\nThe Main Line proper is a line of communities extending northwest from the City of Philadelphia, along what is currently the [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]], from City Line Avenue west to Paoli.\n\n===Core Main Line towns===\nThe original Main Line towns are widely considered to follow the acronym \"Old Maids Never Wed And Have Babies.\"<ref>http://www.e-scholium.org/2017/12/02/discovering-the-entire-hidden-history-of-the-main-line/</ref> From Philadelphia, they are:\n*[[Overbrook]]\n*[[Merion, Pennsylvania|Merion]]\n*[[Narberth, Pennsylvania|Narberth]]\n*[[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]]\n*[[Ardmore, Pennsylvania|Ardmore]]\n*[[Haverford, Pennsylvania|Haverford]]\n*[[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]]\n\nThese seven towns are characterized as one of the primary bastions of old money in Southeastern Pennsylvania. They are comparably more dense than other suburbs and have lively, walkable downtowns. All of these communities were established along Lancaster Avenue prior to the railroad's construction. Additionally, the following two towns are often grouped with the core Main Line, as they were established prior to the line's construction:\n*[[Wayne, Pennsylvania|Wayne]]\n*[[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]], widely considered the western anchor of the Main Line\n\n===Infill Communities===\nBeyond the 9 aforementioned communities, many nearby communities have seeded growth in the twentieth century, either in between the core towns or nearby them. They include:\n*[[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania|Gladwyne]], immediately to the northeast of Bryn Mawr\n*[[Villanova, Pennsylvania|Villanova]] and [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], between Bryn Mawr and Wayne\n*[[Devon, Pennsylvania|Devon]] and [[Berwyn, Pennsylvania|Berwyn]], between Wayne and Paoli\n\nThese communities are primarily residential and comprise of larger lot sizes than in the 9 core towns. All of them, except Gladwyne, are on the railroad and have their own station stop.\n\n===Exurban Communities===\nWhile the Main Line traditionally ends at Paoli, in the 1990s SEPTA extended service west to [[Thorndale, Pennsylvania|Thorndale]]. As such, communities west along the Main Line to Thorndale or even as far west as Parkesburg are considered to be a part of the Main Line.\n\n==Demographics==\nThere is no collective data for the Main Line, so all data is by [[ZIP code]]. In comparison, the median family income and home price for the state of Pennsylvania are $68,646 and $155,000, respectively.<ref>[http://www.brainyzip.com BrainyZip]</ref><ref>[http://www.zip-codes.com Zip-codes.com]</ref> The following ZIP codes are those within the previously mentioned municipalities that make up the Main Line.
