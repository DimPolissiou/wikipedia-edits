This stimulated the economy and trade, and mining and metallurgical industries were developed in the region.

Most water within the city limits is in [[Lake Tuscaloosa]], which is entirely in the city limits, and the [[Black Warrior River]].\n\nTuscaloosa is located at {{coord|33|12|24|N|87|32|5|W|type:city}} (33.206540, \u221287.534607),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. It lies on the [[fall line]] of the Black Warrior River, approximately {{convert|193|mi|km}} upriver from the river's confluence with the [[Tombigbee River]] at [[Demopolis, Alabama|Demopolis]]. Because of its location on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is diverse, varying from heavily forested hills to the northeast to a low-lying, marshy plain to the southwest.\n\n===Cityscape===\nMajor areas of Tuscaloosa city proper include:\n\n*[[West Tuscaloosa, Alabama|West Tuscaloosa]]\n*Central/Midtown Tuscaloosa\n*Downtown Tuscaloosa\n*[[The University of Alabama]] main campus\n*[[Alberta City, Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Alberta City]]\n*North River\n*Hillcrest\n\n===Major highways===\nTuscaloosa is served by many major highways, including [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]], [[Interstate 59|I-59]], and [[U.S. Route 82]]. I-20/59 run west to east through the southern part of the city, leading northeast 58&nbsp;mi (93&nbsp;km) to [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and southwest 96&nbsp;mi (154&nbsp;km) to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian, MS]]. US 82 runs northwest to southeast through the city, locally known as McFarland Boulevard, and leads southeast 103&nbsp;mi (166&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] and northwest 59&nbsp;mi (95&nbsp;km) to [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus, MS]]. Many other state and local highways run through the city as well, in addition to a tolled bypass on the western side of the city connecting those coming from the west on US 82 to I-20/59 without going through the main part of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n[[Image:Snow in tuscaloosa.jpg|thumb|right|A snowstorm paints a winter scene near Lake Tuscaloosa.]]\n\nTypical of the [[Deep South]], Tuscaloosa experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa'') with four distinct seasons. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist [[air mass|air]]. During the [[autumn|fall]], winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along [[weather fronts|fronts]] creates precipitation. These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the [[jet stream]]. Notable exceptions occur during [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]], where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling [[hurricane]]s. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the [[severe weather]] seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet stream flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently [[Precipitation (meteorology)#Convectional rainfall|convectional]], i.e., caused by the warm surface heating the air above.\n\nSevere [[thunderstorm]]s can bring damaging winds, large [[hail]], and occasionally tornadoes. An [[December 2000 Tuscaloosa tornado|F4 tornado]] struck Tuscaloosa County in December 2000, killing eleven people. Tuscaloosa was struck by an [[Fujita scale|F2]] tornado in [[January 1997 tornado outbreak#Tuscaloosa, Alabama|January 1997]], which resulted in the death of one person. In April 2011, two tornadoes in a span of twelve days hit the city, the first being an EF3 on [[Tornado outbreak of April 14\u201316, 2011|April 15]], and the second and more devastating being an EF4 on [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27]], when more than 50 deaths resulted.

These committees usually consist of three council members, one of whom will be chairman, and relevant non-voting city employees.\n\nTuscaloosa, as the largest county seat in western Alabama, serves a hub of state and federal government agencies. In addition to the customary offices associated with the county courthouse, namely two District Court Judges, six Circuit Court Judges, the [[District Attorney]] and the [[Public Defender]], several Alabama state government agencies have regional offices in Tuscaloosa, such as the Alabama Department of Transportation and the Alabama State Troopers (the state police).\n\nTuscaloosa is in the federal jurisdiction of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]]. There is a courthouse in Tuscaloosa simply called the Federal Courthouse. Several federal agencies operate bureaus out of the courthouse.\n\nFederally, Tuscaloosa is split between the 4th and 7th Congressional Districts, which are represented by [[Robert Aderholt]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]) and [[Terri Sewell]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]), respectively. In addition, Alabama's senior [[United States Senate|senator]], [[Richard Shelby]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]), is a resident of Tuscaloosa.\n\nOn the state level, the city is split among the 5th, 21st, and 24th Senate districts and 62nd, 63rd, and 70th House districts in the Alabama State Legislature.\n\nIn December 2009, construction on the new federal courthouse of Tuscaloosa began. The $67 million building was the centerpiece of a major downtown urban renewal project. According to information released by the General Services Administration, the building is  {{convert|129000|sqft|m2}} with parking. It houses the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Social Security Administration office.\n\nThe Northern District of Alabama has only one facility suitable for holding a major criminal trial in Huntsville. However, Huntsville's lacks the facilities for safely moving criminal suspects in and out of the building safely. Tuscaloosa's new federal courthouse will anchor the federal structure for the whole Northern District of Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20091206/NEWS/912059938?p=1&tc=pg |title=Construction begins on new federal courthouse |website=TuscaloosaNews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Government Buildings in Tuscaloosa\n|width= | height= | lines= |align=center |footer=\n|File:Tuscaloosa Court House.jpg |alt1=A view of the Tuscaloosa County Courthouse as seen from Greensboro Avenue |Tuscaloosa County courthouse\n|File:1tuscalfedchtus.jpg |alt2=A view of the Tuscaloosa Federal Courthouse as seen University Blvd |Tuscaloosa Federal Courthouse\n|File:AlvinDuPontMuncourtTuscaloosa.png |alt3=A view of the Municipal Court Building |The Alvin P.

They form a chain of narrow [[reservoirs]], providing aids to navigation and barge handling as well as [[hydroelectric power]] and drinking water. The Black Warrior River watershed is a vital [[river basin]] entirely contained within Alabama, America's leading state for freshwater [[biodiversity]]. Near Tuscaloosa, the river flows out of the rocky [[Cumberland Plateau]] and enters the sandy East [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. [[Barge]] transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Black Warrior a silent giant in the state of Alabama's economy.\nThough the Port of Tuscaloosa is a small one, it is one of the larger facilities on the Black Warrior River at [[waterway]] [[mile marker]] 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry [[bulk commodities]], including [[lignite]], [[coal]] and [[coal coke]]. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.\n\nAt waterway mile marker 343.2 on the opposite side of the river is a steel company with its own tracks at the rear of the plant connecting with the [[Kansas City Southern Railroad]] for barge shipments of iron and steel products such as [[ingots]], bars, rods, steel slabs, plates and coils. Tuscaloosa Steel Corporation was one of the first U.S. steel companies to implement the Steckel Mill Technology.\n\nThe Port of Tuscaloosa grew out of the system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River built by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the 1890s. Its construction opened up an inexpensive transportation link to the Gulf seaport of [[Mobile, Alabama]] that stimulated the [[mining]] and [[metallurgical]] industries of the region that are still in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimelawyer-alabama.com/port-of-tuscaloosa.asp |title=Port of Tuscaloosa Accidents &#124; Offshore Injury Attorney |website=Maritimelawyer-alabama.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] has maintained a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River for over a century to allow navigability all the way up to Birmingham.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Warrior River Watershed Management Plan|url=http://www.adem.state.al.us/programs/water/nps/files/BlackWarriorBMP.pdf|work=adem.state.al.us|publisher=[[Alabama Department of Environmental Management]]|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], on the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Emerging in the early first millennium of the common era were the people of the [[Mississippian culture]]. Like some of the generations before them, they built large earthwork mounds in planned sites that expressed their cosmology. Their large [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], built for political and religious rituals roughly from 900AD to 1500AD, expressed their cosmology.

Also among the historical tribes living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]] in the interior, believed to have migrated south centuries before from the Great Lakes area. The tribes of the coastal plain and Piedmont included the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobilian Jargon|Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title = Alabama Indian Tribes |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |year = 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1828, [[Andrew Jackson]] was elected president of the United States. He had gained popularity when he defeated the Creek at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814, following victories in the War of 1812.

They had already been under pressure from new settlers encroaching on their territory. Most Muscogee-speaking peoples were removed to Indian Territory during the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1834, although some remained behind.

A small assortment of log cabins soon arose near the large [[Creek (people)|Creek]] village at the fall line of the river, which the new settlers named in honor of the sixteenth-century [[Chief Tuskaloosa]] of a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean]]-speaking tribe. In 1817, [[Alabama]] became a [[Alabama Territory|territory]]. On December 13, 1819, the territorial legislature incorporated the town of Tuskaloosa,<ref name=\"alabama-law-1823\">''A Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama: Containing The Statutes and Resolutions in Force at the end of the General Assembly in January, 1823''.

The State House was built at the corner of 6th Street and 28th Avenue (now site of Capitol Park). In 1831, the [[University of Alabama]] was established and the town's population and economy grew rapidly, but the relocation of the capital to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] caused a severe decline. The state legislature established [[Alabama State Hospital for the Insane]] (now [[Bryce Hospital]]) in Tuskaloosa in the 1850s, which helped restore the city's fortunes.\n\n===Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] following Alabama's [[secession]] from the Union, several thousand men from Tuscaloosa fought in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armies. During the last weeks of the War, a brigade of Union troops raiding the city burned the campus of the university.

This stimulated the economy and trade, and mining and metallurgical industries were developed in the region. By the advent of the 20th century, the growth of the University of Alabama and the mental health-care facilities in the city, along with a strong national economy, fueled a steady growth in Tuscaloosa which continued unabated for 100 years.\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Autherine Lucy|Stand in the Schoolhouse Door}}\nIn the postwar era after World War II, African Americans increased their activism to regain their constitutional civil rights, and challenged southern segregation in numerous ways. In 1952, [[Autherine Lucy]] was admitted to the University as a graduate student, but her admission was rescinded when authorities discovered she was not white. After three years of legal wrangling, [[Thurgood Marshall]] and the [[NAACP]] got a court order preventing the University from banning Lucy and another student based on race.

Most water within the city limits is in [[Lake Tuscaloosa]], which is entirely in the city limits, and the [[Black Warrior River]].\n\nTuscaloosa is located at {{coord|33|12|24|N|87|32|5|W|type:city}} (33.206540, \u221287.534607),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. It lies on the [[fall line]] of the Black Warrior River, approximately {{convert|193|mi|km}} upriver from the river's confluence with the [[Tombigbee River]] at [[Demopolis, Alabama|Demopolis]]. Because of its location on the boundary between the Appalachian Highland and the Gulf Coastal Plain, the geography of the area around Tuscaloosa is diverse, varying from heavily forested hills to the northeast to a low-lying, marshy plain to the southwest.\n\n===Cityscape===\nMajor areas of Tuscaloosa city proper include:\n\n*[[West Tuscaloosa, Alabama|West Tuscaloosa]]\n*Central/Midtown Tuscaloosa\n*Downtown Tuscaloosa\n*[[The University of Alabama]] main campus\n*[[Alberta City, Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Alberta City]]\n*North River\n*Hillcrest\n\n===Major highways===\nTuscaloosa is served by many major highways, including [[Interstate 20 in Alabama|I-20]], [[Interstate 59|I-59]], and [[U.S. Route 82]]. I-20/59 run west to east through the southern part of the city, leading northeast 58&nbsp;mi (93&nbsp;km) to [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and southwest 96&nbsp;mi (154&nbsp;km) to [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian, MS]]. US 82 runs northwest to southeast through the city, locally known as McFarland Boulevard, and leads southeast 103&nbsp;mi (166&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] and northwest 59&nbsp;mi (95&nbsp;km) to [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus, MS]]. Many other state and local highways run through the city as well, in addition to a tolled bypass on the western side of the city connecting those coming from the west on US 82 to I-20/59 without going through the main part of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n[[Image:Snow in tuscaloosa.jpg|thumb|right|A snowstorm paints a winter scene near Lake Tuscaloosa.]]\n\nTypical of the [[Deep South]], Tuscaloosa experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa'') with four distinct seasons. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] heavily influences the climate by supplying the region with warm, moist [[air mass|air]]. During the [[autumn|fall]], winter, and spring seasons, the interaction of this warm, moist air with cooler, drier air from the North along [[weather fronts|fronts]] creates precipitation. These fronts usually move from west to east as they track along the [[jet stream]]. Notable exceptions occur during [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]], where storms may move from due south to due north or even from east to west during land-falling [[hurricane]]s. The interaction between low- and high-pressure air masses is most pronounced during the [[severe weather]] seasons in the spring and fall. During the summer, the jet stream flows well to the north of the southeastern U.S., and most precipitation is consequently [[Precipitation (meteorology)#Convectional rainfall|convectional]], i.e., caused by the warm surface heating the air above.\n\nSevere [[thunderstorm]]s can bring damaging winds, large [[hail]], and occasionally tornadoes. An [[December 2000 Tuscaloosa tornado|F4 tornado]] struck Tuscaloosa County in December 2000, killing eleven people. Tuscaloosa was struck by an [[Fujita scale|F2]] tornado in [[January 1997 tornado outbreak#Tuscaloosa, Alabama|January 1997]], which resulted in the death of one person. In April 2011, two tornadoes in a span of twelve days hit the city, the first being an EF3 on [[Tornado outbreak of April 14\u201316, 2011|April 15]], and the second and more devastating being an EF4 on [[2011 Super Outbreak|April 27]], when more than 50 deaths resulted.

These committees usually consist of three council members, one of whom will be chairman, and relevant non-voting city employees.\n\nTuscaloosa, as the largest county seat in western Alabama, serves a hub of state and federal government agencies. In addition to the customary offices associated with the county courthouse, namely two District Court Judges, six Circuit Court Judges, the [[District Attorney]] and the [[Public Defender]], several Alabama state government agencies have regional offices in Tuscaloosa, such as the Alabama Department of Transportation and the Alabama State Troopers (the state police).\n\nTuscaloosa is in the federal jurisdiction of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]].

The $67 million building was the centerpiece of a major downtown urban renewal project. According to information released by the General Services Administration, the building is  {{convert|129000|sqft|m2}} with parking. It houses the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Social Security Administration office.\n\nThe Northern District of Alabama has only one facility suitable for holding a major criminal trial in Huntsville. However, Huntsville's lacks the facilities for safely moving criminal suspects in and out of the building safely. Tuscaloosa's new federal courthouse will anchor the federal structure for the whole Northern District of Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20091206/NEWS/912059938?p=1&tc=pg |title=Construction begins on new federal courthouse |website=TuscaloosaNews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Government Buildings in Tuscaloosa\n|width= | height= | lines= |align=center |footer=\n|File:Tuscaloosa Court House.jpg |alt1=A view of the Tuscaloosa County Courthouse as seen from Greensboro Avenue |Tuscaloosa County courthouse\n|File:1tuscalfedchtus.jpg |alt2=A view of the Tuscaloosa Federal Courthouse as seen University Blvd |Tuscaloosa Federal Courthouse\n|File:AlvinDuPontMuncourtTuscaloosa.png |alt3=A view of the Municipal Court Building |The Alvin P.

They form a chain of narrow [[reservoirs]], providing aids to navigation and barge handling as well as [[hydroelectric power]] and drinking water. The Black Warrior River watershed is a vital [[river basin]] entirely contained within Alabama, America's leading state for freshwater [[biodiversity]]. Near Tuscaloosa, the river flows out of the rocky [[Cumberland Plateau]] and enters the sandy East [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. [[Barge]] transportation in and out of the Port of Tuscaloosa and other commercial navigation make the Black Warrior a silent giant in the state of Alabama's economy.\nThough the Port of Tuscaloosa is a small one, it is one of the larger facilities on the Black Warrior River at [[waterway]] [[mile marker]] 338.5. There are no railway connections at this port as they primarily concentrate on the shipment of dry [[bulk commodities]], including [[lignite]], [[coal]] and [[coal coke]]. The federal government and the City of Tuscaloosa share the ownership of the Port of Tuscaloosa; the operation of the port is leased out to Powell Sales and has been run by them since 1997.\n\nAt waterway mile marker 343.2 on the opposite side of the river is a steel company with its own tracks at the rear of the plant connecting with the [[Kansas City Southern Railroad]] for barge shipments of iron and steel products such as [[ingots]], bars, rods, steel slabs, plates and coils. Tuscaloosa Steel Corporation was one of the first U.S. steel companies to implement the Steckel Mill Technology.\n\nThe Port of Tuscaloosa grew out of the system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior River built by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the 1890s. Its construction opened up an inexpensive transportation link to the Gulf seaport of [[Mobile, Alabama]] that stimulated the [[mining]] and [[metallurgical]] industries of the region that are still in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimelawyer-alabama.com/port-of-tuscaloosa.asp |title=Port of Tuscaloosa Accidents &#124; Offshore Injury Attorney |website=Maritimelawyer-alabama.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] has maintained a system of locks and dams along the Black Warrior River for over a century to allow navigability all the way up to Birmingham.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Warrior River Watershed Management Plan|url=http://www.adem.state.al.us/programs/water/nps/files/BlackWarriorBMP.pdf|work=adem.state.al.us|publisher=[[Alabama Department of Environmental Management]]|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Barge traffic thus routinely runs through Tuscaloosa to the Alabama State Docks at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], on the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nEscalante has a total land area of {{convert|19276.303|ha}}. It is located on the northeastern tip of Negros Occidental, facing the island of Cebu.  It is {{convert|49|km}} from San Carlos City and {{convert|95|km}} from [[Bacolod City]], the provincial capital.  It is bounded on the north and west by the city of [[Sagay]], on the south by the town of [[Toboso, Negros Occidental|Toboso]] and on the east by the [[Ta\u00f1on Strait]].\n\nOutside the city center of Escalante, there is a separate region of low rolling hills, especially going to its upland barangays towards Mt. Lunay.  The hill land section is the remnant of past volcanism and probably, represents either dormant volcanic cinder cones or outliers of a once more extensive volcanic formation.  Local residents in the upland barangays of Escalante at the foot of Mt. Lunay testify to period rumblings of a volcano generally believed 'to be dead'. An indicator of the dormant character of Mt. Lunay is the existence to this day of a sulphur spring at its foot.  Often, the slopes of these hills as in Barangay Binaguiohan are quite steep.  However, the steepness of the slope has not stopped Escalantehanons in cultivation of the hillside.\n\n===Coastal environment===\n\nThe diversity of plants in the coastal environment of Escalante is one of the richest in Occidental Negros.  Its coasts comprise two surviving ecosystems: the mangrove, consisting of trees and shrubs that occupies the landward portion of its coastal areas; the seagrass, or grasslike plants, that thrive on it shallow nearshore area.  In a limited coastal zone, remnants of a third ecosystem, coral reef may be found but in residual, degraded form.  The marine waters of Escalante are generally warm throughout the year, except for early mornings of the cool months of December, January and February.  Salinity of its waters is within reasonable amount, at 28-36 parts per thousand.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Escalante1.jpg|thumb|Mt. Lunay in Barangay Paitan where The Giant Cross used to stand]]\nThe atmospheric conditions influencing the climate of Escalante as a whole are the same conditions operative in Negros Island. During the summer months (April to December) an air stream is directed from the south. This air current follows a counterclockwise path as it approaches the low-pressure center of the Asian continent, and reaches the Philippines from a southwestern direction as the southwestern monsoon or ''habagat''.  During the period from November to January, Negros has relatively cool weather as the Asian continent cools more rapidly than the surrounding seas, resulting in high-pressure centers leading to winds being deflected in a clockwise fashion.\n\nThis period is known as the northeastern monsoon or ''amihan''. From March to April the northeastern wind system dominates. The cool season in Escalante is from December through March. It is also the time when low tides called ''aya-ay'' prevail, making beachcombing of its shores more pleasurable. The latter part of March through June is when the highest temperatures prevail.  But being largely coastal, Escalante enjoys a constant flow of refreshing sea breeze.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nEscalante City is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s.  The following table shows its corresponding population, area, and distance from the city proper.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Barangay !!

But archaeological findings in October 1975 and May 1976 made by a team of Anthropology students led by Professor Lionel Chiong of Silliman University reveal an early record of men who inhabited not only the present city but also the island of Negros during the pre-Spanish time. The findings were recovered in nine (9) graves in what seemed to be an ancient burial ground in Barangay Japitan, a coastal barangay lying along the Ta\u00f1on Strait, facing the island of Cebu, some 17 kilometers from the city proper.  The artifacts consisted of celadon plate and bowls, stoneware bowls and jars, a Sung Dynasty (960-1280 A.D.) jarlet, gold beads, iron implements, daggers and a hunting knife with an ivory bone handle.\n\nObviously buried with the dead, the plate, bowls, jars and iron implements were found alongside the skeletal remains, the daggers and hunting knives on top of the breast section and the gold beads inside the skulls in-between the upper and lower jaws. When carbon-14 tested, these findings together with the human skeletal remains were found to date as far back as the 12th century A.D. All this proved that present-day Escalante was inhabited by settlers with a relatively developed culture who were engaged in some form of trade and commerce with the outside world, such as the Chinese and Japanese traders who could have brought the jarlet, stoneware and celadon pieces during the Ages of Contacts and Trade with the East (11th & 12th centuries A.D.)\n\n===Spanish Era===\nThe northeastern part of Negros Island was \"one of the most cultivated regions\" in the mid-19th century.\n\nOn November 28, 1856, Governor-General Manuel Crespo issued a decree creating the towns of Escalante and Saravia. The decree ordered \"that the two towns in question would be separated immediately from their mother town, Silay,\" although the spiritual separation of the two \"would await the building of churches and convents in Saravia and Escalante.\"  The latter had its seat of government in the barrio of Nueva Sevilla (Barangay Old Poblacion).<ref>History of Negros by Angel Martinez Cuesta. trans. from original Spanish by Alfonso Felix Jr., and Caritas Sevilla. Historical Conservation Society, Manila: 1980</ref>\n\nThe Parish of Escalante was finally established on May 22, 1860 with Fr. Cipriano Navarro, OAR, as the first Parish Priest.  Fr. Navarro, in a report to the Recollect Provincial in 1861, wrote that the inhabitants of his Parish and its 14 barrios lying along the northeast portion of the island from Calatrava to Himogaan, \"speak the Cebuano dialect and all, or the majority, came from Cebu, with the exception of those from Barrio Marianas (Himogaan) . . . who came from the district of Iloilo and speak the Hiligaynon dialect.\"\n\nIn 1859, a politico-Military Command was established in Bacolod under Governor Emilio E. Saravia with six towns under its jurisdiction: Escalante, Guihulngan, Jinuboan, Jimalalud, Tayasan, and Ayungon.<ref>http://www.cbcponline.net/dumaguete</ref> Two more were added, Arguelles (Sagay) and Calatrava when these were created into separate towns on July 3, 1863.  This ended with the division of Negros into two provinces in 1889.\n\nSchools for boys and girls were established in the late 1860s.  By 1869 a school for boys and another for girls were already operating in the town.  By 1890, these schools were among the very few managed by Normal School graduates.\n\nAs early as 1871, Escalante was a major link between Bacolod and Cebu.  A mail service route, Bacolod-Escalante-Tutuban-Toledo, Cebu was already exclusively in use by May 1871.  In 1875 a mail boat belonging to Emerenciano Amante, the Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) of Escalante, transported mail between Toledo and Escalante every week.\n\nA telegraphic station was established in 1894. The telegraphic cable was extended later on to Tuburan, Cebu and was operational by October 1897.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town lived from subsistence agriculture.  They produced among others, rice, corn, buri, edible root crops, and tobacco. Their second most important economic activity was fishing.\n\nTobacco was grown commercially but its production decreased when monopoly was established starting from the time of Don Emilio Saravia (1855\u20131857), the first politico-military of the Negros Island.  In its stead, sugarcane was gradually being grown. It was not clear when the first sugar mill was established in town. But by 1891, Escalante had already 6 steam-engine sugar mills; 36 powered by horses; and 11 by carabaos. Approximately 848 hectares were planted to sugarcane..\n\n===American Era===\nThe American period covering some 45 years (December, 1898 to July 3, 1946, except for a few years under the Japanese occupation) saw marked changes in the socio-cultural, economic and political complexion of the area and its people. To capture the hearts and minds of the inhabitants without the use of guns and cannons, the Americans opened the first free elementary school at Old Poblacion in the early 1900s.\n\nA Gabaldon-type elementary school building was constructed at Old Poblacion during the term of Mayor Fernando Lucot (1912\u20131918). The municipal hall and the town plaza were constructed and developed during the time of Francisco Ferrer, Sr. Also at this time, the first municipal school site where the first elementary school was located, was formally acquired, and the installation of the Rizal Monument at the public plaza completed.  The municipal portal and Rizal Monument was built on Sept. 15, 1955.  The bandstand and skating rink was constructed on September 28, 1935.\n\n===Japanese Era===\n\nIn 1942, the occupation by the Japanese Imperial forces entered the towns in Escalante. The establishment of the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and the 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active again on October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946 and military stationed in the town municipality of Escalante during the Japanese Occupation.\n\nIn 1945, local Filipino soldiers of the 7th, 72nd, 75th and 76th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated the towns in Escalante, Negros Occidental and helping Negrosanon guerrilla fighters defeats and attacking Japanese Imperial forces and ended of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1941, Victor Bedonia succeeded Francisco Ferrer Sr. as mayor, and was supported by the local guerillas. The siege of all Filipino troops of the Philippine Army and Constabulary units was found liberated in the town municipality on 1945 against the Japanese. He served until 1948. The Japanese however installed Enrique Ballesteros as mayor until the end of the war.\n\n===Post-War Era===\nTwo (2) years after liberation, Escalante was divided into two (2) municipalities.  President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order 141 dated May 19, 1948 \"Organizing certain barrios of the Municipality of Escalante, Province of Negros Occidental, into an independent municipality under the name Toboso\", to take effect July 1, 1948.  Victor Bedonia who was then the incumbent mayor of Escalante opted to become the first mayor of the newly created town of Toboso. Pedro Benignos took over until 1950. In 1951, Evaristo Sanz took over and was replaced thereafter by Amando Tambo. It was during Mayor Tambo\u2019s time when the seat of government, by virtue of Executive Order No. 301 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia on May 30, 1958, was transferred from Barangay Old Poblacion to its present site at Barangay Balintawak.\n\nThe first high school, the Escalante National High School, was donated by Manuel A. Lopez in 1946 and established in 1948.  A decade later, in 1961, the Mount Carmel College was established by the Order of the Carmelites.  Aside from the churches in the Municipality of Toboso, in Escalante and in Brgy Old. Poblacion, it also erected the Magdalen Hospital which was run by the Sisters of Julie Postel.  This hospital is now called the Dr. Vicente Gustilo District Hospital, under the management of the Provincial Government.  This placed the new town in an enviable position, not only being a center of higher education and quality medical care in this part of Negros.\n\nThis brought about profound changes in the socio-cultural, economic and political life of the town as it provided the much-needed opportunity for children of poor families in the area to acquire college education.  Other public schools were opened up later on, such that there are now 27 public elementary schools, 6 national public high schools and 3 extension high schools.\n\n===The Martial Law Years===\n\nDuring this time, a modern public market, new municipal building, and the 50,000-gallon reservoir was erected under the mayor Braulio P. Lumayno.  The Martial Law Years was seemingly  quiet.  However, the uneven land distribution, marginal food production, and the excesses of the political system created so much discontent especially in the sugarcane farms.  This was one of the reasons why the BAYAN-led \"Welgang Bayan\" which ended in the [[Escalante massacre]]. Twenty-one rallyists who were determined to paralyze traffic, died on the spot on the streets of Escalante when the militia of then-strongman Congressman Armando Gustilo, who was bent on dispersing the rally, fired their guns on rallyists. This event was one of the important factors for the downfall of the Marcos regime.\n\nWith the installation of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Mrs. Evelyn L. Hinolan was selected as OIC Mayor.  Then BAYAN Chairman Rolando Ponsica, who was one of the persecuted during the Martial Law years, easily became the mayor in 1988.\n\n==City Charter for Escalante==\n\nAfter 143 years of existence as a municipality, under the leadership of Mayor Santiago G. Barcelona, Jr., Escalante was now qualified to become a city.  On July 24, 1998, the Sangguniang Bayan of Escalante passed Resolution No. 98-79 \"requesting the  Congressman Julio A. Ledesma IV of the 1st District of Negros Occidental to file a bill in Congress creating / converting the Municipality of Escalante into a new City of Escalante.\"  Six days later, Congressman Ledesma filed House Bill No. 1514 \"An act converting the Municipality of Escalante into a component city to be known as the City of Escalante.\"  In spite of a moratorium on the creation of cities imposed by the Malaca\u00f1ang in 1999.\n\nCongress went ahead with its enactment.  After conducting a public hearing right here in the town on November 27, 1999, Congress passed the substitute bill, House Bill No. 8882, on second reading on December 9, 1999.  More than a week later, it passed the bill on third and final reading.\n\nA similar bill, Senate Bill No. 1786, was filed by Sen. Serge Osme\u00f1a III in the House of the Senate on October 22, 1999. Senate Bill No. 2245 (in substitution of Senate Bill No. 1786) was passed on third and final reading on February 8, 2001, the last session of the 11th Congress.\n\nBoth bills became Republic Act No. 9014, \"An act converting the Municipality of Escalante, Province of Negros Occidental into a component city to be known as the City of Escalante.\"  It was signed into law on February 28, 2001 by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and was ratified in a plebiscite held on March 31, 2001.  Of 14,723 who actually voted, 14,075 voted \"YES\" and only 648 voted \"NO\".<ref>City Planning and Development Office, City of Escalante</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Escalante\n| 1903 = 12192\n| 1918 = 29287\n| 1939 = 60152\n| 1948 = 56846\n| 1960 = 59768\n| 1970 = 52060\n| 1975 = 63969\n| 1980 = 71293\n| 1990 = 72685\n| 1995 = 79928\n| 2000 = 79098\n| 2007 = 92035\n| 2010 = 93725\n| 2015 = 94070\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nThe city has grown at a respectably fast rate, averaging 1.63% in the ten years (2000 thru 2010). The May 2010 Census on Population showed that population increased to 93,005 persons. This means that on average that population grew by 1.63% annually since 2000.  This is only about 3.20% of the province\u2019s population which includes Bacolod City or 3.88% without it. At this rate, the city\u2019s population is expected to double by year 2053.\n\nThe average household for 2000 was 4.89 persons per household, which is lower than the 5.0 national, 5.1 regional and the 5.24 provincial averages. NSO estimates there were 92,035 persons in 2007 in 18,644 households.  This means, the average households size increased to 4.94.<ref>Philippine Statistics Authority, PopCen 2007</ref>\n\nAs of December 2009, the average age is 24 years old.<ref>Escalante City Health Office 2009</ref>\n\nEscalante has the highest population density (persons/square kilometer) in 2007, among the provinces's cities at 736.3, second only to the provincial capital, Bacolod City.  The provincial average is 362.1, while the cities average 417.8.<ref>Negros Occidental Socio-Economic Trends 2008</ref>\n\nThe people in the city speak the [[Cebuano language]] (often called Bisaya) closely followed by [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] (often called Ilonggo).

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Geography==\n\nEscalante has a total land area of {{convert|19276.303|ha}}. It is located on the northeastern tip of Negros Occidental, facing the island of Cebu.  It is {{convert|49|km}} from San Carlos City and {{convert|95|km}} from [[Bacolod City]], the provincial capital.  It is bounded on the north and west by the city of [[Sagay]], on the south by the town of [[Toboso, Negros Occidental|Toboso]] and on the east by the [[Ta\u00f1on Strait]].\n\nOutside the city center of Escalante, there is a separate region of low rolling hills, especially going to its upland barangays towards Mt. Lunay.  The hill land section is the remnant of past volcanism and probably, represents either dormant volcanic cinder cones or outliers of a once more extensive volcanic formation.  Local residents in the upland barangays of Escalante at the foot of Mt. Lunay testify to period rumblings of a volcano generally believed 'to be dead'. An indicator of the dormant character of Mt. Lunay is the existence to this day of a sulphur spring at its foot.  Often, the slopes of these hills as in Barangay Binaguiohan are quite steep.  However, the steepness of the slope has not stopped Escalantehanons in cultivation of the hillside.\n\n===Coastal environment===\n\nThe diversity of plants in the coastal environment of Escalante is one of the richest in Occidental Negros.  Its coasts comprise two surviving ecosystems: the mangrove, consisting of trees and shrubs that occupies the landward portion of its coastal areas; the seagrass, or grasslike plants, that thrive on it shallow nearshore area.  In a limited coastal zone, remnants of a third ecosystem, coral reef may be found but in residual, degraded form.  The marine waters of Escalante are generally warm throughout the year, except for early mornings of the cool months of December, January and February.  Salinity of its waters is within reasonable amount, at 28-36 parts per thousand.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Escalante1.jpg|thumb|Mt. Lunay in Barangay Paitan where The Giant Cross used to stand]]\nThe atmospheric conditions influencing the climate of Escalante as a whole are the same conditions operative in Negros Island. During the summer months (April to December) an air stream is directed from the south. This air current follows a counterclockwise path as it approaches the low-pressure center of the Asian continent, and reaches the Philippines from a southwestern direction as the southwestern monsoon or ''habagat''.  During the period from November to January, Negros has relatively cool weather as the Asian continent cools more rapidly than the surrounding seas, resulting in high-pressure centers leading to winds being deflected in a clockwise fashion.\n\nThis period is known as the northeastern monsoon or ''amihan''. From March to April the northeastern wind system dominates. The cool season in Escalante is from December through March. It is also the time when low tides called ''aya-ay'' prevail, making beachcombing of its shores more pleasurable. The latter part of March through June is when the highest temperatures prevail.  But being largely coastal, Escalante enjoys a constant flow of refreshing sea breeze.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nEscalante City is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s.  The following table shows its corresponding population, area, and distance from the city proper.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Barangay !!

But archaeological findings in October 1975 and May 1976 made by a team of Anthropology students led by Professor Lionel Chiong of Silliman University reveal an early record of men who inhabited not only the present city but also the island of Negros during the pre-Spanish time. The findings were recovered in nine (9) graves in what seemed to be an ancient burial ground in Barangay Japitan, a coastal barangay lying along the Ta\u00f1on Strait, facing the island of Cebu, some 17 kilometers from the city proper.  The artifacts consisted of celadon plate and bowls, stoneware bowls and jars, a Sung Dynasty (960-1280 A.D.) jarlet, gold beads, iron implements, daggers and a hunting knife with an ivory bone handle.\n\nObviously buried with the dead, the plate, bowls, jars and iron implements were found alongside the skeletal remains, the daggers and hunting knives on top of the breast section and the gold beads inside the skulls in-between the upper and lower jaws. When carbon-14 tested, these findings together with the human skeletal remains were found to date as far back as the 12th century A.D. All this proved that present-day Escalante was inhabited by settlers with a relatively developed culture who were engaged in some form of trade and commerce with the outside world, such as the Chinese and Japanese traders who could have brought the jarlet, stoneware and celadon pieces during the Ages of Contacts and Trade with the East (11th & 12th centuries A.D.)\n\n===Spanish Era===\nThe northeastern part of Negros Island was \"one of the most cultivated regions\" in the mid-19th century.\n\nOn November 28, 1856, Governor-General Manuel Crespo issued a decree creating the towns of Escalante and Saravia. The decree ordered \"that the two towns in question would be separated immediately from their mother town, Silay,\" although the spiritual separation of the two \"would await the building of churches and convents in Saravia and Escalante.\"  The latter had its seat of government in the barrio of Nueva Sevilla (Barangay Old Poblacion).<ref>History of Negros by Angel Martinez Cuesta. trans. from original Spanish by Alfonso Felix Jr., and Caritas Sevilla. Historical Conservation Society, Manila: 1980</ref>\n\nThe Parish of Escalante was finally established on May 22, 1860 with Fr. Cipriano Navarro, OAR, as the first Parish Priest.  Fr. Navarro, in a report to the Recollect Provincial in 1861, wrote that the inhabitants of his Parish and its 14 barrios lying along the northeast portion of the island from Calatrava to Himogaan, \"speak the Cebuano dialect and all, or the majority, came from Cebu, with the exception of those from Barrio Marianas (Himogaan) . . . who came from the district of Iloilo and speak the Hiligaynon dialect.\"\n\nIn 1859, a politico-Military Command was established in Bacolod under Governor Emilio E. Saravia with six towns under its jurisdiction: Escalante, Guihulngan, Jinuboan, Jimalalud, Tayasan, and Ayungon.<ref>http://www.cbcponline.net/dumaguete</ref> Two more were added, Arguelles (Sagay) and Calatrava when these were created into separate towns on July 3, 1863.  This ended with the division of Negros into two provinces in 1889.\n\nSchools for boys and girls were established in the late 1860s.  By 1869 a school for boys and another for girls were already operating in the town.  By 1890, these schools were among the very few managed by Normal School graduates.\n\nAs early as 1871, Escalante was a major link between Bacolod and Cebu.  A mail service route, Bacolod-Escalante-Tutuban-Toledo, Cebu was already exclusively in use by May 1871.  In 1875 a mail boat belonging to Emerenciano Amante, the Gobernadorcillo (Mayor) of Escalante, transported mail between Toledo and Escalante every week.\n\nA telegraphic station was established in 1894. The telegraphic cable was extended later on to Tuburan, Cebu and was operational by October 1897.\n\nThe inhabitants of the town lived from subsistence agriculture.  They produced among others, rice, corn, buri, edible root crops, and tobacco. Their second most important economic activity was fishing.\n\nTobacco was grown commercially but its production decreased when monopoly was established starting from the time of Don Emilio Saravia (1855\u20131857), the first politico-military of the Negros Island.  In its stead, sugarcane was gradually being grown. It was not clear when the first sugar mill was established in town. But by 1891, Escalante had already 6 steam-engine sugar mills; 36 powered by horses; and 11 by carabaos. Approximately 848 hectares were planted to sugarcane..\n\n===American Era===\nThe American period covering some 45 years (December, 1898 to July 3, 1946, except for a few years under the Japanese occupation) saw marked changes in the socio-cultural, economic and political complexion of the area and its people. To capture the hearts and minds of the inhabitants without the use of guns and cannons, the Americans opened the first free elementary school at Old Poblacion in the early 1900s.\n\nA Gabaldon-type elementary school building was constructed at Old Poblacion during the term of Mayor Fernando Lucot (1912\u20131918). The municipal hall and the town plaza were constructed and developed during the time of Francisco Ferrer, Sr. Also at this time, the first municipal school site where the first elementary school was located, was formally acquired, and the installation of the Rizal Monument at the public plaza completed.  The municipal portal and Rizal Monument was built on Sept. 15, 1955.  The bandstand and skating rink was constructed on September 28, 1935.\n\n===Japanese Era===\n\nIn 1942, the occupation by the Japanese Imperial forces entered the towns in Escalante. The establishment of the general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active on January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 and the 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active again on October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946 and military stationed in the town municipality of Escalante during the Japanese Occupation.\n\nIn 1945, local Filipino soldiers of the 7th, 72nd, 75th and 76th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated the towns in Escalante, Negros Occidental and helping Negrosanon guerrilla fighters defeats and attacking Japanese Imperial forces and ended of the Second World War.\n\nIn 1941, Victor Bedonia succeeded Francisco Ferrer Sr. as mayor, and was supported by the local guerillas. The siege of all Filipino troops of the Philippine Army and Constabulary units was found liberated in the town municipality on 1945 against the Japanese. He served until 1948. The Japanese however installed Enrique Ballesteros as mayor until the end of the war.\n\n===Post-War Era===\nTwo (2) years after liberation, Escalante was divided into two (2) municipalities.  President Elpidio Quirino issued Executive Order 141 dated May 19, 1948 \"Organizing certain barrios of the Municipality of Escalante, Province of Negros Occidental, into an independent municipality under the name Toboso\", to take effect July 1, 1948.  Victor Bedonia who was then the incumbent mayor of Escalante opted to become the first mayor of the newly created town of Toboso. Pedro Benignos took over until 1950. In 1951, Evaristo Sanz took over and was replaced thereafter by Amando Tambo. It was during Mayor Tambo\u2019s time when the seat of government, by virtue of Executive Order No. 301 issued by President Carlos P. Garcia on May 30, 1958, was transferred from Barangay Old Poblacion to its present site at Barangay Balintawak.\n\nThe first high school, the Escalante National High School, was donated by Manuel A. Lopez in 1946 and established in 1948.  A decade later, in 1961, the Mount Carmel College was established by the Order of the Carmelites.  Aside from the churches in the Municipality of Toboso, in Escalante and in Brgy Old. Poblacion, it also erected the Magdalen Hospital which was run by the Sisters of Julie Postel.  This hospital is now called the Dr. Vicente Gustilo District Hospital, under the management of the Provincial Government.  This placed the new town in an enviable position, not only being a center of higher education and quality medical care in this part of Negros.\n\nThis brought about profound changes in the socio-cultural, economic and political life of the town as it provided the much-needed opportunity for children of poor families in the area to acquire college education.  Other public schools were opened up later on, such that there are now 27 public elementary schools, 6 national public high schools and 3 extension high schools.\n\n===The Martial Law Years===\n\nDuring this time, a modern public market, new municipal building, and the 50,000-gallon reservoir was erected under the mayor Braulio P. Lumayno.  The Martial Law Years was seemingly  quiet.  However, the uneven land distribution, marginal food production, and the excesses of the political system created so much discontent especially in the sugarcane farms.  This was one of the reasons why the BAYAN-led \"Welgang Bayan\" which ended in the [[Escalante massacre]]. Twenty-one rallyists who were determined to paralyze traffic, died on the spot on the streets of Escalante when the militia of then-strongman Congressman Armando Gustilo, who was bent on dispersing the rally, fired their guns on rallyists. This event was one of the important factors for the downfall of the Marcos regime.\n\nWith the installation of Pres. Corazon C. Aquino, Mrs. Evelyn L. Hinolan was selected as OIC Mayor.  Then BAYAN Chairman Rolando Ponsica, who was one of the persecuted during the Martial Law years, easily became the mayor in 1988.\n\n==City Charter for Escalante==\n\nAfter 143 years of existence as a municipality, under the leadership of Mayor Santiago G. Barcelona, Jr., Escalante was now qualified to become a city.  On July 24, 1998, the Sangguniang Bayan of Escalante passed Resolution No. 98-79 \"requesting the  Congressman Julio A. Ledesma IV of the 1st District of Negros Occidental to file a bill in Congress creating / converting the Municipality of Escalante into a new City of Escalante.\"  Six days later, Congressman Ledesma filed House Bill No. 1514 \"An act converting the Municipality of Escalante into a component city to be known as the City of Escalante.\"  In spite of a moratorium on the creation of cities imposed by the Malaca\u00f1ang in 1999.\n\nCongress went ahead with its enactment.  After conducting a public hearing right here in the town on November 27, 1999, Congress passed the substitute bill, House Bill No. 8882, on second reading on December 9, 1999.  More than a week later, it passed the bill on third and final reading.\n\nA similar bill, Senate Bill No. 1786, was filed by Sen. Serge Osme\u00f1a III in the House of the Senate on October 22, 1999. Senate Bill No. 2245 (in substitution of Senate Bill No. 1786) was passed on third and final reading on February 8, 2001, the last session of the 11th Congress.\n\nBoth bills became Republic Act No. 9014, \"An act converting the Municipality of Escalante, Province of Negros Occidental into a component city to be known as the City of Escalante.\"  It was signed into law on February 28, 2001 by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and was ratified in a plebiscite held on March 31, 2001.  Of 14,723 who actually voted, 14,075 voted \"YES\" and only 648 voted \"NO\".<ref>City Planning and Development Office, City of Escalante</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Escalante\n| 1903 = 12192\n| 1918 = 29287\n| 1939 = 60152\n| 1948 = 56846\n| 1960 = 59768\n| 1970 = 52060\n| 1975 = 63969\n| 1980 = 71293\n| 1990 = 72685\n| 1995 = 79928\n| 2000 = 79098\n| 2007 = 92035\n| 2010 = 93725\n| 2015 = 94070\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nThe city has grown at a respectably fast rate, averaging 1.63% in the ten years (2000 thru 2010).

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively.

He was Kiwi number 136 after playing two tests for New Zealand against Australia in 1919.\n\n==Early Life==\nIt is unclear where Thomas Haddon was born or raised. The first clear indication of him being in Auckland is with his debut for [[City Rovers]] in the opening game of the [[1918 Auckland Rugby League season]]. There are no records of him being born or marrying in [[New Zealand]]. At the start of 1920 he was thought to have moved to [[Australia]] to play rugby league but there are no records of him playing there after being given permission by the New Zealand Rugby League Council.\n\n==Playing career==\n===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand===\nTom Haddon first appeared for [[City Rovers]] in 1918 in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition, playing for them against [[Grafton Athletic]] in a preliminary round to open the season <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Northern Union/Teams for Saturday/North Shore\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLIX, Issue 99\n| date = 1918-04-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19180426.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>.

During the war the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had decided to largely cease its representative program. Haddon\u2019s debut was against [[Canterbury rugby league team]] and it resulted in a comfortable 45-9 victory to Auckland with Haddon scoring twice.

He was Kiwi number 136 after playing two tests for New Zealand against Australia in 1919.\n\n==Early Life==\nIt is unclear where Thomas Haddon was born or raised. The first clear indication of him being in Auckland is with his debut for [[City Rovers]] in the opening game of the [[1918 Auckland Rugby League season]]. There are no records of him being born or marrying in [[New Zealand]]. At the start of 1920 he was thought to have moved to [[Australia]] to play rugby league but there are no records of him playing there after being given permission by the New Zealand Rugby League Council.\n\n==Playing career==\n===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand===\nTom Haddon first appeared for [[City Rovers]] in 1918 in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition, playing for them against [[Grafton Athletic]] in a preliminary round to open the season <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Northern Union/Teams for Saturday/North Shore\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLIX, Issue 99\n| date = 1918-04-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19180426.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>.

During the war the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had decided to largely cease its representative program. Haddon\u2019s debut was against [[Canterbury rugby league team]] and it resulted in a comfortable 45-9 victory to Auckland with Haddon scoring twice. The match was played in front of 10,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nIn [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Haddon was again playing for City and in a round two match against [[North Shore Albions]] on the Devonport Domain in front of 500 spectators <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championships Continue/City V North Shore\n| page =5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVI| issue=17158\n| date = 1919-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190512.2.21.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>.

On air since September 1998 and devised by Briggs, the show's format sees contestants taking on multiple-choice questions based upon general knowledge, winning a cash prize for each question they answer correctly, with the amount offered increasing as they take on more difficult questions. To assist each contestant who takes part, they are given lifelines to use, may walk away with the money they already have won if they wish not to risk answering a question, and are provided with a safety net that gives them a guaranteed cash prize if they give an incorrect answer, provided they reach a specific milestone in the quiz.\n\nThe original series aired for 30 series and aired a total of 592 episodes, from 4 September 1998 to 11 February 2014, and was presented by [[Chris Tarrant]]. Over the course of its initial run, the show had five contestants achieve the show\u2019s ultimate aim and walk away with the cash prize of \u00a31&nbsp;million. The original format of the programme was tweaked in later years; this included changing the number of questions from fifteen to twelve, altering the payout structure and later incorporating a time limit which included an attainable fourth lifeline. There were several controversies during its run, including an attempt by a contestant to [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|defraud the show of its top prize]].\n\nFour years after the original series ended, ITV announced that the series would be revived, this time produced by [[Stellify Media]], to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the programme. The revival was based closely on the show\u2019s original format. It was hosted by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10 studios]]. The success of the revival series has ensured that subsequent series of the show have been commissioned, and in January 2019 the show reached the milestone of 600 episodes since first appearing on air.\n\nThe game show became one of the most significant shows in British popular culture, ranking 23rd in a list of the [[BFI TV 100|100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled in 2000 by the [[British Film Institute]]. It was the highest quiz programme to appear on the list. Its success led to versions in [[International versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|many other countries]] under an [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|international franchise of the same name]], all of which follow the same general format, though with some versions including unique differences in gameplay and lifelines provided.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width =\n| align = right\n| header = UK presenters of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''\n| image1 = Chris Tarrant Phooto.jpg\n| image2 = Jeremy Clarkson.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| width2 = 135\n| caption1 = [[Chris Tarrant]] (1998\u20132014)\n| caption2 = [[Jeremy Clarkson]] (2018\u2013present)\n| alt1 = Tarrant\n| alt2 = Clarkson\n}}\n\n===Creation===\nThe creation of the game show was led by David Briggs, assisted by Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had helped him before with creating a number of promotional games for Chris Tarrant's [[Capital Breakfast|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio. The basic premise for the show was a twist on the conventional game-show genre of the time, with a focus towards the setup used in radio quizzes, in that the programme would have one contestant taking on the game and answering questions, but with the ability to pull out at any time, to have certain points in the quiz where once passed, they could have a set prize given to them if they should give a wrong answer, and be provided with special forms of assistance during their game. During the design phase, the show was given the [[working title]] of \"Cash Mountain\", before Briggs decided upon using the name of the [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', as the show's finalised title.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After presenting their idea to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the broadcaster gave the green-light for production to begin on a series.\n\nThe set designed for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], who focused the design towards making contestants feel uncomfortable, creating an atmosphere of tension similar to [[Thriller film|movie thriller]].<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{Cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> The design was in stark contrast to the design of sets made for more typical game shows, which are designed to make contestants feel more at ease.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Walmsley's design feature a central stage made primarily with [[Plexiglas]], with a huge dish underneath covered in mirror paper,<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/><ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> onto which two slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs were chosen for use by both the contestant and the host, each having an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each that would be used to display questions and other pertinent information. The rest of the set featured seating spaced out around the main stage in a circle, with breaks in them to allow movement of people on and off the set. The lighting rig used for the set was designed so as to allow only the lights to switch from illuminating the entire set, to focusing on the host and contestant on the main stage when a game was underway, but to include special lighting effects when the contestant reached higher cash prize amounts. His overall conception would eventually prove to be a success, becoming one of the most reproduced scenic designs in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/>\n\nThe music provided for the show was composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. The Strachans' composition for the game show helped with Briggs' tense game design, by providing the necessary drama and tension. Unlike other game show musical scores, the music provided for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was designed to be played throughout the entire episode of the show. The Strachans main theme for the game show was inspired from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. For the main game of the show, the pair designed the music to feature three variations, with the second and third compositions focused on emphasising the increased tension of the game \u2013 as a contestant made progress to higher cash amounts, the pitch of the music was increased by a semitone for each subsequent question.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=21 March 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]]'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Original series===\nWith the show created, ITV assigned [[Chris Tarrant]] as its host, and set its premiere to 4 September 1998. The programme was assigned a timeslot of one hour, to provide room for three commercial breaks, with episodes produced by UK production company [[Celador]].

In three cases, the matters could not be proven by the claimants \u2013 in 2002, Mike Bull, a [[Southampton]]-based journalist, was given an out-of-court settlement when he claimed the authorship of lifelines was his work, though with a confidentiality clause attached; in 2003, Sydney resident John J.

In 2002, he started legal proceedings against the production company, ITV, and five individuals who had claimed they had created ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', stating that the idea from the show was taken from several elements he had created \u2013 a board game format he conceived in 1981; a two-page TV format, known as ''Millionaire'', made in 1987; and the telephone mechanics for a TV concept he created in 1989, ''BT Lottery''. In his claim, Bachini stated that he submitted documents for his TV concepts to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to [[Claudia Rosencrantz]] of ITV, also in January 1996, accusing both of using roughly 90% of the format for ''Millionaire'' in the pilot for the game show, including the use of twenty questions, lifelines and safety nets, although the lifelines were conceived under different names \u2013 Bachini claimed that he never coined the phrase \"phone-a-friend\" that Briggs designed in his format. In response to this claim, Celador made a counter-claim that the franchise originated from the basic format idea conceived by Briggs. The defendants in the claim took Bachini to a summary hearing but lost their right to have his claim dismissed. Although Bachini won the right to go to trial, he was unable to after the hearing due to serious illness. Celador eventually settled the matter with him out-of-court.<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, Celador began procedures to sell the format of the show and all UK episodes, as part of their first step towards the sale of their formats divisions.

Once an application was made, production staff selected an episode's contestants through a combination of random selection, and a potential contestant's ability to answer a set of test questions based on general knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Game rules=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right\"\t\n|-\t\n!colspan=4 style=\"background: #58B9E4\"| Payout structure\t\n|-\t\n!rowspan=2| Question<br>number\t\n!colspan=3| Question value\t\n|-\t\n! 1998\u20132007; 2018\u2013present\t\n! 2007\u20132014\t\n|-\t\n| 1\t\n| \u00a3100\t\n| \u00a3500\t\t\n|-\t\n| 2\t\n| \u00a3200\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a31,000'''\t\n|-\t\n| 3\t\n| \u00a3300\t\n| \u00a32,000\t\n|-\t\n| 4\t\n| \u00a3500\t\n| \u00a35,000\t\n|-\t\n| 5\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a31,000'''\t\n| \u00a310,000\t\n|-\t\n| 6\t\n| \u00a32,000\t\n| \u00a320,000\t\n|-\t\n| 7\t\n| \u00a34,000\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a350,000'''\t\n|-\t\n| 8\t\n| \u00a38,000\t\n| \u00a375,000\t\n|-\t\n| 9\t\n| \u00a316,000\t\n| \u00a3150,000\t\n|-\t\n| 10\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a332,000'''\t\n| \u00a3250,000\t\n|-\t\n| 11\t\n| \u00a364,000\t\n| \u00a3500,000\t\n|-\t\n| 12\t\n| \u00a3125,000\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''''\u00a31,000,000'''''\t\n|-\t\n| 13\t\n| \u00a3250,000\t\n| rowspan=3 {{N/A}}\t\n|-\t\n| 14\t\n| \u00a3500,000\n|-\t\n| 15\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''''\u00a31,000,000'''''\t\n|-\n\t\n|}\n\nOnce contestants auditioned for a part on the programme and filming took place, they undertook a preliminary round entitled \"Fastest Finger First\". Initially, the round required contestants to provide the correct answer to a question, but from series 2 onwards, they were tasked with putting four answers in the correct order stated within the question (i.e. earliest to latest). The contestant who answered the question correctly, and in the fastest time, won the opportunity to play the main game. In the event that no one answered the question correctly, a new question was asked, while if two or more contestants gave the correct answer in the same time, there was a tiebreaker question to determine who proceeded to the main game. The round was primarily used to determine the next contestant for the main game, and was more often than not used more than once in an episode.\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary round, the contestant began the main game, tackling a series of increasingly difficult questions, which offered progressively higher sums of money, up to the top prize of \u00a31,000,000. The stacks of 15 questions were randomly chosen from a list of pre generated questions based on general knowledge. For each question there were four options to choose from, labelled \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019. During the game, contestants were allowed to use a set of 3 lifelines to help them with a question at any time, and two monetary safety nets were provided: if a contestant got a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they left with that amount as their prize. If a contestant was unsure about a question they were facing, they were allowed to leave the game at that point with the cash amount they had already won. While the initial questions were typically generally easy, the subsequent ones after it required the contestant to confirm that their answer/decision is final, at which point it became locked in and could not be reversed. As a rule, host Tarrant was not shown the correct answer on his monitor until a contestant had given their final answer. If an episode had reached the end of its allotted time, an audio cue was triggered to highlight this; contestants who were still playing the main game were left to wait until filming for the next episode began before they could continue, though this was not the case for special editions of the show, such as celebrity episodes.\n\nOver the course of the show's history on British television, the format of the programme has been altered in a number of aspects, mainly towards the setup of questions and the payout structure used in the game show, along with minor tweaks and changes in other aspects:\n* Between September 1998 and July 2007, contestants had to answer 15 questions, with two safety nets placed at \u00a31,000 and \u00a332,000, and they were allowed three standard lifelines.\n* Between August 2007 and February 2014, the number of questions was reduced to 12, with most cash values adjusted. This alteration led to the second safety net being assigned to \u00a350,000.\n* From the start of the 27th series in August 2010, the format was changed to include a clock format, similar to the 2008\u201310 US version, but with some differences. The time limit was 15 seconds for the first two questions, and 30 seconds for the next five questions, but the last five questions had no time limit. The clock would start ticking down as soon as the answers appeared on screen, and the contestant would have to give his/her final answer within the time limit. If they ran out of time it was treated as an incorrect answer. The clock would briefly pause, however, if any lifeline was used. It also added a new, fourth lifeline, Switch, which would be made available after passing question seven. The first episode of this series also saw the discontinuation of 'Fastest Finger First' for the first time since the inception of the show, so the contestants were then pre-selected by the production staff.\n* For the revival in 2018 and subsequent series of the show, the show returned to the 1998\u20132007 format, including the original payout structure and fastest finger process, with minor differences. A new lifeline, \u2018Ask The Host\u2019, was introduced and the placement of the second safety net could be set by the contestant. Upon reaching \u00a31,000, the contestant would be asked before each subsequent question if they would like to set the safety net to the cash value, with it offered up to question 14, \u00a3500,000. The number of contestants for 'Fastest Finger First' were also reduced from ten to six.\n* At the end of the allotted time of each standard episode, a loud sound (one long brass note) indicates the end of the show. The host refers to this noise as the \u2018klaxon\u2019. During the live specials whilst Tarrant was host, the contestant's game would end and any question in play would be null and void unless they gave a final answer before the klaxon sounded. The contestant\u2019s game then carries on at the start of the next episode.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a contestant's game, they may make use of a set of lifelines to assist them on a question. Each lifeline may only be used once. Throughout the course of the show's history, these lifelines involve the following:\n* '''50:50''': (1998\u2013present): Two random incorrect answers are eliminated by the computer, leaving the correct answer and the one remaining incorrect answer, thus granting the contestant a 50/50 chance of answering the question correctly.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': (1998\u2013present): The contestant calls one of their friends, and has 30 seconds to read the question and answers to them. The friend uses the leftover time to offer an answer. Since 2011, a member of the production team accompanies the friend to prevent cheating, such as using the Internet or reading books, and is verified by the presenter before the contestant can confer.\n* '''Ask the Audience''': (1998\u2013present): Audience members use keypads to vote on what they believe to be the correct answer to the question they\u2019ve been asked. The percentage of each option selected by the audience is displayed to the contestant and audience after this vote.\n* '''Switch/Flip''' (2002\u201303, 2010\u201314): The computer replaces one question with another of the same monetary value. Any lifelines already used on the original question are not reinstated. In its original run, Switch was originally called \"Flip\" and could only be used if the contestant traded an unused lifeline for it, using it up to three times. From 2010 to 2014, this lifeline was separated and became available after the contestant answered seven questions correctly.\n* '''Ask the Host''' (2018\u2013present): The presenter offers advice or an answer to the question they are asked. The host usually discloses that he has no contact with outside sources, and there is no time limit as to how long he can offer help. The question's answer is not revealed to the host when this lifeline is used; instead, the computer reveals the answer to the host and contestant at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/who-wants-be-millionaire-returns-itv-saturday-brand-new-twists|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? returns to ITV this Saturday with brand new twists|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Series\n!Start date\n!End date\n!Episodes\n!Presenter\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|4 September 1998\n|25 December 1998\n|10\n| rowspan=\"30\" |[[Chris Tarrant]]\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|1 January 1999\n|13 January 1999\n|13\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|5 March 1999\n|16 March 1999\n|12\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|3 September 1999\n|14 September 1999\n|13\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|5 November 1999\n|25 December 1999\n|18\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|16 January 2000\n|22 January 2000\n|7\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|26 March 2000\n|1 May 2000\n|13\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|7 September 2000\n|6 January 2001\n|55\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|8 January 2001\n|26 April 2001\n|45\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|4 September 2001\n|29 December 2001\n|43\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|5 January 2002\n|9 April 2002\n|55\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|31 August 2002\n|28 December 2002\n|20\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|4 January 2003\n|31 May 2003\n|22\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|30 August 2003\n|27 December 2003\n|22\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|3 January 2004\n|5 June 2004\n|23\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|18 September 2004\n|25 December 2004\n|16\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|1 January 2005\n|11 June 2005\n|25\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|17 September 2005\n|31 December 2005\n|10\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|7 January 2006\n|8 July 2006\n|28\n|-\n|'''20'''\n|9 September 2006\n|6 January 2007\n|13\n|-\n|'''21'''\n|10 March 2007\n|28 July 2007\n|18\n|-\n|'''22'''\n|18 August 2007\n|30 October 2007\n|10\n|-\n|'''23'''\n|1 January 2008\n|3 June 2008\n|20\n|-\n|'''24'''\n|16 August 2008\n|31 January 2009\n|18\n|-\n|'''25'''\n|13 June 2009\n|20 December 2009\n|20\n|-\n|'''26'''\n|13 April 2010\n|8 June 2010\n|8\n|-\n|'''27'''\n|3 August 2010\n|23 December 2010\n|10\n|-\n|'''28'''\n|2 April 2011\n|19 December 2011\n|6\n|-\n|'''29'''\n|3 January 2012\n|20 December 2012\n|10\n|-\n|'''30'''\n|1 January 2013\n|11 February 2014\n|10\n|-\n|'''31'''\n|5 May 2018\n|11 May 2018\n|7\n| rowspan=\"6\" |[[Jeremy Clarkson]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''32'''\n| 1 January 2019\n| 6 January 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10\n|-\n|4 March 2019\n|8 March 2019\n|-\n|'''33'''\n|24 August 2019 \n|20 October 2019\n|10\n|-\n|'''34'''\n|25 December 2019\n|TBC 2020\n|12\n|}\n\n===Specials===\n*'''''Is that Your Final Answer?''''' \u2013 a one-hour documentary about the show, which aired on ITV on 24 December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukchristmastv.weebly.com/itv-1999.html|title=ITV 1999|website=UK Christmas TV|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xrMLC3tA0|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire \u2013 Is That Your Final Answer Documentary (1999)|first=|last=Coldclough|publisher=|accessdate=5 January 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> Directed and produced by Robin Lough, it featured rare footage from the unaired pilot version of the programme, which has completely different music and behind the scenes footage from the programmes aired in Series 4 (September 1999).

The documentary later aired on 15 February 2004, with subtitles, on [[HRT 2]] in Croatia. A special episode of the French version of ''Millionaire'', entitled \"''L'\u00e9mission interdite''\" (English translation: ''Prohibited episode''), was devoted to the scandal.

The competition was offered to viewers at home to play the text game where they had to answer the question, if a contestant decided to walk home with the cash prize they have got, by choosing the letters 'A, B, C or D' within 30 seconds to a specific mobile number. The viewer who answered the question won \u00a31,000 by having their entries selected randomly.\n\nOn 9 September 2006, there were some changes. The competition stayed the same but this time, they played it before some commercial breaks.  A question to which the contestant had given their final answer, but the correct answer had not yet been revealed, was offered as a competition to viewers.

On air since September 1998 and devised by Briggs, the show's format sees contestants taking on multiple-choice questions based upon general knowledge, winning a cash prize for each question they answer correctly, with the amount offered increasing as they take on more difficult questions. To assist each contestant who takes part, they are given lifelines to use, may walk away with the money they already have won if they wish not to risk answering a question, and are provided with a safety net that gives them a guaranteed cash prize if they give an incorrect answer, provided they reach a specific milestone in the quiz.\n\nThe original series aired for 30 series and aired a total of 592 episodes, from 4 September 1998 to 11 February 2014, and was presented by [[Chris Tarrant]]. Over the course of its initial run, the show had five contestants achieve the show\u2019s ultimate aim and walk away with the cash prize of \u00a31&nbsp;million. The original format of the programme was tweaked in later years; this included changing the number of questions from fifteen to twelve, altering the payout structure and later incorporating a time limit which included an attainable fourth lifeline. There were several controversies during its run, including an attempt by a contestant to [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|defraud the show of its top prize]].\n\nFour years after the original series ended, ITV announced that the series would be revived, this time produced by [[Stellify Media]], to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the programme. The revival was based closely on the show\u2019s original format. It was hosted by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10 studios]]. The success of the revival series has ensured that subsequent series of the show have been commissioned, and in January 2019 the show reached the milestone of 600 episodes since first appearing on air.\n\nThe game show became one of the most significant shows in British popular culture, ranking 23rd in a list of the [[BFI TV 100|100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled in 2000 by the [[British Film Institute]]. It was the highest quiz programme to appear on the list. Its success led to versions in [[International versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|many other countries]] under an [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|international franchise of the same name]], all of which follow the same general format, though with some versions including unique differences in gameplay and lifelines provided.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width =\n| align = right\n| header = UK presenters of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''\n| image1 = Chris Tarrant Phooto.jpg\n| image2 = Jeremy Clarkson.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| width2 = 135\n| caption1 = [[Chris Tarrant]] (1998\u20132014)\n| caption2 = [[Jeremy Clarkson]] (2018\u2013present)\n| alt1 = Tarrant\n| alt2 = Clarkson\n}}\n\n===Creation===\nThe creation of the game show was led by David Briggs, assisted by Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had helped him before with creating a number of promotional games for Chris Tarrant's [[Capital Breakfast|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio. The basic premise for the show was a twist on the conventional game-show genre of the time, with a focus towards the setup used in radio quizzes, in that the programme would have one contestant taking on the game and answering questions, but with the ability to pull out at any time, to have certain points in the quiz where once passed, they could have a set prize given to them if they should give a wrong answer, and be provided with special forms of assistance during their game. During the design phase, the show was given the [[working title]] of \"Cash Mountain\", before Briggs decided upon using the name of the [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', as the show's finalised title.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After presenting their idea to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the broadcaster gave the green-light for production to begin on a series.\n\nThe set designed for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], who focused the design towards making contestants feel uncomfortable, creating an atmosphere of tension similar to [[Thriller film|movie thriller]].<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{Cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> The design was in stark contrast to the design of sets made for more typical game shows, which are designed to make contestants feel more at ease.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Walmsley's design feature a central stage made primarily with [[Plexiglas]], with a huge dish underneath covered in mirror paper,<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/><ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> onto which two slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs were chosen for use by both the contestant and the host, each having an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each that would be used to display questions and other pertinent information. The rest of the set featured seating spaced out around the main stage in a circle, with breaks in them to allow movement of people on and off the set. The lighting rig used for the set was designed so as to allow only the lights to switch from illuminating the entire set, to focusing on the host and contestant on the main stage when a game was underway, but to include special lighting effects when the contestant reached higher cash prize amounts. His overall conception would eventually prove to be a success, becoming one of the most reproduced scenic designs in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/>\n\nThe music provided for the show was composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. The Strachans' composition for the game show helped with Briggs' tense game design, by providing the necessary drama and tension. Unlike other game show musical scores, the music provided for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was designed to be played throughout the entire episode of the show. The Strachans main theme for the game show was inspired from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. For the main game of the show, the pair designed the music to feature three variations, with the second and third compositions focused on emphasising the increased tension of the game \u2013 as a contestant made progress to higher cash amounts, the pitch of the music was increased by a semitone for each subsequent question.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=21 March 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]]'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Original series===\nWith the show created, ITV assigned [[Chris Tarrant]] as its host, and set its premiere to 4 September 1998. The programme was assigned a timeslot of one hour, to provide room for three commercial breaks, with episodes produced by UK production company [[Celador]]. Originally, the show was broadcast on successive evenings for around ten days, before the network modified its broadcast schedule in autumn 2000<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/29/broadcasting3|title=Millionaire ratings slide|first=Jason|last=Deans|date=29 November 2001|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> to air it within a primetime slot on Saturday evenings, with occasional broadcasts on Tuesday evenings.

In three cases, the matters could not be proven by the claimants \u2013 in 2002, Mike Bull, a [[Southampton]]-based journalist, was given an out-of-court settlement when he claimed the authorship of lifelines was his work, though with a confidentiality clause attached; in 2003, Sydney resident John J.

In 2002, he started legal proceedings against the production company, ITV, and five individuals who had claimed they had created ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', stating that the idea from the show was taken from several elements he had created \u2013 a board game format he conceived in 1981; a two-page TV format, known as ''Millionaire'', made in 1987; and the telephone mechanics for a TV concept he created in 1989, ''BT Lottery''. In his claim, Bachini stated that he submitted documents for his TV concepts to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to [[Claudia Rosencrantz]] of ITV, also in January 1996, accusing both of using roughly 90% of the format for ''Millionaire'' in the pilot for the game show, including the use of twenty questions, lifelines and safety nets, although the lifelines were conceived under different names \u2013 Bachini claimed that he never coined the phrase \"phone-a-friend\" that Briggs designed in his format. In response to this claim, Celador made a counter-claim that the franchise originated from the basic format idea conceived by Briggs. The defendants in the claim took Bachini to a summary hearing but lost their right to have his claim dismissed. Although Bachini won the right to go to trial, he was unable to after the hearing due to serious illness. Celador eventually settled the matter with him out-of-court.<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, Celador began procedures to sell the format of the show and all UK episodes, as part of their first step towards the sale of their formats divisions.

Initially, the round required contestants to provide the correct answer to a question, but from series 2 onwards, they were tasked with putting four answers in the correct order stated within the question (i.e. earliest to latest). The contestant who answered the question correctly, and in the fastest time, won the opportunity to play the main game. In the event that no one answered the question correctly, a new question was asked, while if two or more contestants gave the correct answer in the same time, there was a tiebreaker question to determine who proceeded to the main game. The round was primarily used to determine the next contestant for the main game, and was more often than not used more than once in an episode.\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary round, the contestant began the main game, tackling a series of increasingly difficult questions, which offered progressively higher sums of money, up to the top prize of \u00a31,000,000. The stacks of 15 questions were randomly chosen from a list of pre generated questions based on general knowledge. For each question there were four options to choose from, labelled \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019. During the game, contestants were allowed to use a set of 3 lifelines to help them with a question at any time, and two monetary safety nets were provided: if a contestant got a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they left with that amount as their prize. If a contestant was unsure about a question they were facing, they were allowed to leave the game at that point with the cash amount they had already won. While the initial questions were typically generally easy, the subsequent ones after it required the contestant to confirm that their answer/decision is final, at which point it became locked in and could not be reversed. As a rule, host Tarrant was not shown the correct answer on his monitor until a contestant had given their final answer. If an episode had reached the end of its allotted time, an audio cue was triggered to highlight this; contestants who were still playing the main game were left to wait until filming for the next episode began before they could continue, though this was not the case for special editions of the show, such as celebrity episodes.\n\nOver the course of the show's history on British television, the format of the programme has been altered in a number of aspects, mainly towards the setup of questions and the payout structure used in the game show, along with minor tweaks and changes in other aspects:\n* Between September 1998 and July 2007, contestants had to answer 15 questions, with two safety nets placed at \u00a31,000 and \u00a332,000, and they were allowed three standard lifelines.\n* Between August 2007 and February 2014, the number of questions was reduced to 12, with most cash values adjusted. This alteration led to the second safety net being assigned to \u00a350,000.\n* From the start of the 27th series in August 2010, the format was changed to include a clock format, similar to the 2008\u201310 US version, but with some differences. The time limit was 15 seconds for the first two questions, and 30 seconds for the next five questions, but the last five questions had no time limit. The clock would start ticking down as soon as the answers appeared on screen, and the contestant would have to give his/her final answer within the time limit. If they ran out of time it was treated as an incorrect answer. The clock would briefly pause, however, if any lifeline was used. It also added a new, fourth lifeline, Switch, which would be made available after passing question seven. The first episode of this series also saw the discontinuation of 'Fastest Finger First' for the first time since the inception of the show, so the contestants were then pre-selected by the production staff.\n* For the revival in 2018 and subsequent series of the show, the show returned to the 1998\u20132007 format, including the original payout structure and fastest finger process, with minor differences. A new lifeline, \u2018Ask The Host\u2019, was introduced and the placement of the second safety net could be set by the contestant. Upon reaching \u00a31,000, the contestant would be asked before each subsequent question if they would like to set the safety net to the cash value, with it offered up to question 14, \u00a3500,000. The number of contestants for 'Fastest Finger First' were also reduced from ten to six.\n* At the end of the allotted time of each standard episode, a loud sound (one long brass note) indicates the end of the show. The host refers to this noise as the \u2018klaxon\u2019. During the live specials whilst Tarrant was host, the contestant's game would end and any question in play would be null and void unless they gave a final answer before the klaxon sounded. The contestant\u2019s game then carries on at the start of the next episode.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a contestant's game, they may make use of a set of lifelines to provide assistance on a question. Each lifeline may only be used once. Throughout the course of the show's history, these lifelines involve the following:\n* '''50:50''': Two random incorrect answers are eliminated by the computer, leaving the correct answer and the one remaining incorrect answer, thus granting the contestant a 50/50 chance of answering the question correctly.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': The contestant calls one of their friends, and has 30 seconds to read the question and answers to them. The friend uses the leftover time to offer an answer. Since 2011, a member of the production team accompanies the friend to prevent cheating, such as using the Internet or reading books. Since the revival in 2018, host Jeremy Clarkson makes sure this is carried out over each phone a friend phone call by asking the contestant\u2019s phone a friend to confirm that a member of the production office is present to record them and ensure no form of cheating occurs.\n* '''Ask the Audience''': Audience members use keypads to vote on what they believe to be the correct answer to the question they\u2019ve been asked. The percentage of each option selected by the audience is displayed to the contestant after this vote, as well as appearing on TV.\n* '''Switch/Flip''' (2002\u201303, 2010\u201314): The computer replaces one question with another of the same monetary value. Any lifelines already used on the original question are not reinstated. In its original run, Switch was originally called \"Flip\" and could only be used if the contestant chose to trade in one of their unused lifelines for it, using it up to three times. From 2010 to 2014, this lifeline was separated and became available after the contestant answered seven questions correctly.\n* '''Ask the Host''' (2018\u2013present): Host Jeremy Clarkson offers advice or an answer to the question he is asked. This lifeline can also be used just once. He must disclose that he has no contact with outside sources and there is no time limit as to how long he can offer help. On this question, the answer does not reveal itself to the host when the contestant plays; instead, the computer reveals the answer to the host and contestant at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/who-wants-be-millionaire-returns-itv-saturday-brand-new-twists|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? returns to ITV this Saturday with brand new twists|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Series\n!Start date\n!End date\n!Episodes\n!Presenter\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|4 September 1998\n|25 December 1998\n|10\n| rowspan=\"30\" |[[Chris Tarrant]]\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|1 January 1999\n|13 January 1999\n|13\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|5 March 1999\n|16 March 1999\n|12\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|3 September 1999\n|14 September 1999\n|13\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|5 November 1999\n|25 December 1999\n|18\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|16 January 2000\n|22 January 2000\n|7\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|26 March 2000\n|1 May 2000\n|13\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|7 September 2000\n|6 January 2001\n|55\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|8 January 2001\n|26 April 2001\n|45\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|4 September 2001\n|29 December 2001\n|43\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|5 January 2002\n|9 April 2002\n|55\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|31 August 2002\n|28 December 2002\n|20\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|4 January 2003\n|31 May 2003\n|22\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|30 August 2003\n|27 December 2003\n|22\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|3 January 2004\n|5 June 2004\n|23\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|18 September 2004\n|25 December 2004\n|16\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|1 January 2005\n|11 June 2005\n|25\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|17 September 2005\n|31 December 2005\n|10\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|7 January 2006\n|8 July 2006\n|28\n|-\n|'''20'''\n|9 September 2006\n|6 January 2007\n|13\n|-\n|'''21'''\n|10 March 2007\n|28 July 2007\n|18\n|-\n|'''22'''\n|18 August 2007\n|30 October 2007\n|10\n|-\n|'''23'''\n|1 January 2008\n|3 June 2008\n|20\n|-\n|'''24'''\n|16 August 2008\n|31 January 2009\n|18\n|-\n|'''25'''\n|13 June 2009\n|20 December 2009\n|20\n|-\n|'''26'''\n|13 April 2010\n|8 June 2010\n|8\n|-\n|'''27'''\n|3 August 2010\n|23 December 2010\n|10\n|-\n|'''28'''\n|2 April 2011\n|19 December 2011\n|6\n|-\n|'''29'''\n|3 January 2012\n|20 December 2012\n|10\n|-\n|'''30'''\n|1 January 2013\n|11 February 2014\n|10\n|-\n|'''31'''\n|5 May 2018\n|11 May 2018\n|7\n| rowspan=\"6\" |[[Jeremy Clarkson]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''32'''\n| 1 January 2019\n| 6 January 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10\n|-\n|4 March 2019\n|8 March 2019\n|-\n|'''33'''\n|24 August 2019 \n|20 October 2019\n|10\n|-\n|'''34'''\n|25 December 2019\n|TBC 2020\n|12\n|}\n\n===Specials===\n*'''''Is that Your Final Answer?''''' \u2013 a one-hour documentary about the show, which aired on ITV on 24 December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukchristmastv.weebly.com/itv-1999.html|title=ITV 1999|website=UK Christmas TV|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xrMLC3tA0|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire \u2013 Is That Your Final Answer Documentary (1999)|first=|last=Coldclough|publisher=|accessdate=5 January 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> Directed and produced by Robin Lough, it featured rare footage from the unaired pilot version of the programme, which has completely different music and behind the scenes footage from the programmes aired in Series 4 (September 1999). A similar documentary of the same name was also aired in Australia during 2000. A shorter half-hour Russian version was aired on 4 November 2000.

It also looked at the original [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (American game show)|U.S.]] and [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

The documentary later aired on 15 February 2004, with subtitles, on [[HRT 2]] in Croatia. A special episode of the French version of ''Millionaire'', entitled \"''L'\u00e9mission interdite''\" (English translation: ''Prohibited episode''), was devoted to the scandal.

The competition was offered to viewers at home to play the text game where they had to answer the question, if a contestant decided to walk home with the cash prize they have got, by choosing the letters 'A, B, C or D' within 30 seconds to a specific mobile number. The viewer who answered the question won \u00a31,000 by having their entries selected randomly.\n\nOn 9 September 2006, there were some changes. The competition stayed the same but this time, they played it before some commercial breaks.  A question to which the contestant had given their final answer, but the correct answer had not yet been revealed, was offered as a competition to viewers. Entry was via [[SMS]] text message at a cost of \u00a31 per entry, and the competition ran through the commercial break, after which the answer was revealed and the game continued.

Her manager, Max Gredinger, has presented her with [[Billie Eilish]] and [[Shawn Mendes]] as models for potential super-stardom.{{R|Coscarelli}}\n\nCoscarelli wrote: \"Maia, who overflows with earnestness and giggles, has assembled an independent, D.I.Y. mini-empire almost by accident.\"{{R|Coscarelli}} Bote described Maia as \"really, really good at the internet\".{{r|Bote}} Maia makes comedy videos on the video sharing platform, [[TikTok]], where she has amassed 1.3 million followers and 46&nbsp;million likes as of October 2019.{{r|TikTok}} To date, she has made appearances on [[Vine (service)|Vine]], [[Tumblr]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Snapchat]], [[Bandcamp]], [[Pinterest]] and [[SoundCloud]] as well as TikTok.{{R|Coscarelli}} Her music has been streamed over 300 million times across all online platforms collectively.{{r|Cohen}} As of October 2019, her YouTube channel has over 43 million total video views and 504 thousand subscribers.{{r|YT}} As of October 2019, Maia has almost 4 million [[List of most-streamed artists on Spotify|monthly streamers]] on [[Spotify]].{{R|Spotify}}{{needs update|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n=== Influences ===\nMaia has cited [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[The Black Keys]], [[Sufjan Stevens]] and [[Elliott Smith]] as her influences.{{r|Smith}}\n\n==Personal life==\nMaia identifies as \"a young [[bisexual]] woman of color from a family of immigrants\"{{r|Cline}} and currently lives in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], where she writes, records and produces her own music from the guest room of her parents' home.{{r|OTW}} She graduated from high school in June 2018.{{r|Tweet4}} While Maia was growing up, her parents played [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], including [[Salt-N-Pepa]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]], which she still listens to for nostalgia.{{R|Sidewalk}}\n\n== Discography ==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Details\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\" |[[Top Heatseekers|US<br />Heat.]]<br />{{r|Masquerade US Heat}}\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\" |[[Independent Albums|US <br />Indie]]<br />{{r|Masquerade US Indie}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[The Masquerade (mxmtoon album)|the masquerade]]''\n|\n* Released: September 17, 2019\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: CD, digital download, streaming, vinyl\n|{{align|center|17}}\n|{{align|center|45}}\n|}\n\n===Extended plays===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Details\n! scope=\"col\" |Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''plum blossom''{{r|AM2}}\n|\n* Released: December 7, 2018\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: CD, digital download, streaming, vinyl\n|{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| total_length = 22:20\n| title1 = clich\u00e9\n| length1 = 3:04\n| title2 = i feel like chet\n| length2 = 3:03\n| title3 = feelings are fatal\n| length3 = 2:05\n| title4 = the idea of you\n| length4 = 2:48\n| title5 = porcelain\n| length5 = 4:32\n| title6 = temporary nothing\n| length6 = 3:07\n| title7 = i miss you\n| length7 = 3:41\n}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''plum blossom (the edits)''{{r|PBTE}}\n|\n*Released: April 26, 2019\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: Digital download, streaming\n|{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| total_length = 8:29\n| title1 = temporary nothing {{Small|(feat.
