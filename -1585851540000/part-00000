Throughout his lifetime, Baldung developed a distinctive style, full of color, expression and imagination. His talents were varied, and he produced a great and extensive variety of work including portraits, woodcuts, altarpieces, drawings, tapestries, allegories and mythological motifs.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHans Baldung was born in [[Swabia]], Germany around the year 1484 to a family of intellectuals, academics and professionals. His father was a lawyer and his uncle was a doctor, and many other of his family members maintained professional degrees. In fact, Baldung was the first male in his family not to attend university, but was one of the first German artists to come from an academic family.<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 303-304., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> His earliest training as an artist began around 1500 in the Upper Rhineland by an artist from Strasbourg.\n\n==Life as a student of D\u00fcrer==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Die Kreuzigung Christi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Crucifixion]]\n\nBeginning in 1503, during the \"Wanderjahre\" required of artists of the time, Baldung became an assistant to the most well renowned German artist of the day: Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Here, he may have been given his nickname \u201cGrien.\u201d This name is thought to have come foremost from a preference to the color green:  he seems to have worn green clothing. He probably also got this nickname to distinguish him from at least two other Hanses in D\u00fcrer's shop, Hans Sch\u00e4ufelein and Hans Suess von Kulmbach. He later included the name \"Grien\" in his monogram, and it has also been suggested that the name came from, or consciously echoed, \"grienhals\", a German word for witch\u2014one of his signature themes.  Hans quickly picked up D\u00fcrer's influence and style, and they became friends:  Baldung seems to have managed D\u00fcrer's workshop during the latter's second sojourn in Venice. In a later trip to the Netherlands in 1521 D\u00fcrer's account book records that he took with him and sold prints by Baldung. On D\u00fcrer's death Baldung was sent a lock of his hair, which suggests a close friendship. Near the end of his Nuremberg years, Grien oversaw the production by D\u00fcrer of stained glass, woodcuts and engravings, and therefore developed an affinity for these media and for the Nuremberg master's handing of them.\n\n==Strasbourg==\n\nIn 1509, when Baldung's time in Nuremberg was complete, he moved back to Strasbourg and became a [[Citizenship#Middle Ages|citizen there]]. He became a celebrity of the town, and received many important [[commissioner|commissions]].  The following year he married Margarethe Herlin, a local merchant's daughter,<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 305, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> joined the [[guild]] \"zur Steltz\", opened a workshop, and began signing his works with the HGB [[monogram]] that he used for the rest of his career. His style also became much more deliberately individual\u2014a tendency [[art historians]] used to term \"[[mannerist]].\"\n\n==Witchcraft and religious imagery==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0]]'']] \n\nIn addition to traditional religious subjects, Baldung was concerned during these years with the profane theme of the imminence of death and with scenes of sorcery and [[witchcraft]]. He helped introduce supernatural and [[Erotic art|erotic]] themes into German art, although these were already amply present in D\u00fcrer's work. Most famously, he depicted witches, also a local interest: Strasbourg's humanists studied witchcraft and its bishop was charged with finding and prosecuting witches. His most characteristic works in this area are small in scale and mostly in the medium of drawing; these include a series of puzzling, often erotic allegories and mythological works executed in pen and ink and white body color on prepared paper. The number of Hans Baldung's religious works diminished with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which generally repudiated church art as either wasteful or idolatrous. But earlier, around the same time that he produced an important chiaroscuro woodcut of Adam and Eve, the artist became interested in themes related to death, the supernatural, witchcraft, sorcery, and the relation between the sexes.  Baldung's fascination with witchcraft began early, with his first chiaroscuro print (1510) lasted to the end of his career.\n\nHans Baldung Grien's work depicting witches was produced in the first half of the 16th century, before [[witch hunting]] became a widespread cultural phenomenon in Europe. According to one view, Baldung's work did not represent widespread cultural beliefs at the time of creation but reflected largely individual choices.<ref name=\":0\">Sullivan, Margaret A. \u201cThe Witches of D\u00fcrer and Hans Baldung Grien.\u201d Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 53, no. 2, 2000, pp. 333\u2013401., www.jstor.org/stable/2901872.</ref> On the other hand, through his family, Baldung stood as closer to the leading intellectuals of the day than any of his contemporaries, and could draw on a burgeoning literature on witchcraft, as well as on developing juridical and forensic strategies for witch-hunting.  Furthermore, Baldung never worked directly with any Reformation leaders to spread religious ideals through his artwork, although living in fervently religious Strasbourg,<ref>Rowlands, John. \"Washington and Yale. Hans Baldung Grien\", ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol. 123, no. 937, 1981, pp. 263\u2013263., [www.jstor.org/stable/880364 JSTOR]</ref> although he was a supporter of the movement, working on the high altar in the city of M\u00fcnster, Germany.<ref>Nenonen, Marko, and Raisa Maria Toivo, eds. ''Writing witch-hunt histories: challenging the paradigm''. Brill, 2013.</ref>\n\nBaldung was the first artist to heavily incorporate witches and witchcraft into his artwork (his mentor Albrecht D\u00fcrer had sporadically included them but not as prominently as Baldung would). During his lifetime there were few witch trials, therefore, some believe Baldung's depictions of witchcraft to be based on folklore rather than the cultural beliefs of his time. By contrast, throughout the early sixteenth century, [[humanism]] became very popular, and within this movement, Latin literature was valorized, particularly poetry and satire, some of which included views on witches that could be combined with witch lore massively accumulated in works such as the Malleus Maleficarum. Baldung partook in this culture, producing not only many works depicting Strasbourg humanists and scenes from ancient art and literature, but what an earlier literature on the artist described as his satirical take on his depiction of witches. Gert von der Osten comments on this aspect of \"Baldung [treating] his witches humorously, an attitude that reflects the dominant viewpoint of the humanists in Strasbourg at this time who viewed witchcraft as 'lustig,' a matter that was more amusing than serious\".<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the separation of a satirical tone from deadly serious vilifying intent proves difficult to maintain for Baldung as it is for many other artists, including his rough contemporary [[Hieronymus Bosch]].  Baldung's art simultaneously represents ideals presented in ancient Greek and Roman poetry, such as the pre-16th century notion that witches could control the weather, which Baldung is believed to have alluded to in his 1523 oil painting \"Weather Witches\", which showcases two attractive and naked witches in front of a stormy sky.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nBaldung also regularly incorporated scenes of witches flying in his art, a characteristic that had been contested centuries before his artwork came into being. Flying was inherently attributed to witches by those who believed in the myth of the Sabbath (without their ability to fly, the myth fragmented), such as Baldung, which he depicted in works like \"Witches Preparing for the Sabbath Flight\" (1514).<ref>Hults, Linda C. \"Baldung and the Witches of Freiburg: The Evidence of Images\", ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', vol. 18, no. 2, 1987, pp. 249\u2013276., [www.jstor.org/stable/204283 JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Bildnis einer Dame (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza).jpg|thumb|Throughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations.]]\n\nThroughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations. While D\u00fcrer rigorously details his models, Baldung's style differs by focusing more on the personality of the represented character, an abstract conception of the model's state of mind. Baldung settled eventually in Strasbourg and then to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he executed what is held to be his masterpiece. Here in painted an eleven-panel altarpiece for the Freiburg Cathedral, still intact today, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, including, The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Flight into Egypt, The Crucifixion, Four Saints and The Donators. These depictions were a large part of the artist's greater body of work containing several renowned pieces of the Virgin.{{sfn|Cleef|1907}}\n\nThe earliest pictures assigned to him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram '''H. B.''' interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near [[Baden-Baden]]. Another early work is a portrait of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Maximilian]], drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at [[Karlsruhe]]. \"The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany\" (now Berlin, 1507), were painted for the market-church of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in Saxony.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nBaldung's [[old master print|prints]], though D\u00fcreresque, are very individual in style, and often in subject. They show little direct Italian influence. His paintings are less important than his prints. He worked mainly in [[woodcut]], although he made six [[engraving]]s, one very fine. He joined in the fashion for [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, adding a tone block to a woodcut of 1510.  Most of his hundreds of woodcuts were commissioned for books, as was usual at the time; his \"single-leaf\" woodcuts (i.e. prints not for book illustration) are fewer than 100, though no two catalogues agree as to the exact number.\n\nUnconventional as a draughtsman, his treatment of human form is often exaggerated and eccentric (hence his linkage, in the art historical literature, with European [[Mannerism]]), whilst his ornamental style\u2014profuse, eclectic, and akin to the self-consciously \"German\" strain of contemporary [[Tilia|limewood]] sculptors\u2014is equally distinctive.  Though Baldung has been commonly called the [[Correggio]] of the north, his compositions are a curious medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red and glowing green. Flesh is a mere glaze under which the features are indicated by lines.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nHis works are notable for their individualistic departure from the Renaissance composure of his model, D\u00fcrer, for the wild and fantastic strength that some of them display, and for their remarkable themes.  In the field of painting, his ''[[Eve, the Serpent and Death]]'' ([[National Gallery of Canada]]) shows his strengths well.  There is special force in the \"Death and the Maiden\" panel of 1517 (Basel), in the \"Weather Witches\" (Frankfurt), in the monumental panels of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" (Madrid), and in his many powerful portraits. Baldung's most sustained effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Twelve Apostles, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Flight into Egypt, and the Crucifixion, with [[donor portrait|portraits of donors]], are executed with some of that fanciful power that [[Martin Schongauer]] bequeathed to the [[Swabian school]].{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nAs a portrait painter he is well known. He drew [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as well as Maximilian; and his bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as early as 1514. At a later period he had sittings with Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children, and the picture containing these portraits is still in the gallery at Karlsruhe. Like D\u00fcrer and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], Baldung supported the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He was present at the [[diet of Augsburg]] in 1518, and one of his [[woodcut]]s represents [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in quasi-saintly guise, under the protection of (or being inspired by) the Holy Spirit, which hovers over him in the shape of a dove.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail) - WGA01206.jpg|thumb|Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail)]]\n\n*Two altar wings (Charles the Great, St. George), Augsburg, State Gallery.\n*The birth Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1510\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel,  1512\n*Death and the Maiden, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1517\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1512\n*The Lamentation of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1516\n*Pyramus and Thisbe, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, around 1530\n*The Mass of St. Gregory, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, 1511\n*Christ as a gardener, Darmstadt, Hessen State Museum, 1539\n*The Adoration of the Magi, Dessau, Anhalt Art Gallery, 1510\n*Adam and Eva, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi - Uffizi  \n*Frankfurt am Main, St\u00e4del The Baptism of Christ . 1518\n*Portrait of a youth, Hampton Court, Royal Collection  1509\n*The unlikely couple, Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, 1527\n*Portrait of a man, London, National Gallery, 1514 \n* [[The Three Ages of Man and Death]], Museo del Prado, Madrid\n*The Holy Trinity, London, National Gallery, 1512\n*Venus with Cupid, Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, 1525\n*Phyllis and Aristotle, Paris, Louvre . 1503\n*Stockholm, National Museum Mercury as a planet God . for 1530-1540\n*Vienna, Paintings Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts The Rest on the Flight into Egypt . 1513\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 135px\" caption=\"Selected works\">\nFile:Hans Baldung - Die Heilige Jungfrau als K\u00f6nigin des Himmels mit dem Christkind.jpg|The Virgin as Queen of Heaven with the Christ Child in her arms\nFile:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa - WGA01205.jpg|Mater Dolorosa \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|''Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten''\nFile:Baldung FR Hochaltar.02.JPG|Nativity\nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Venus and Amor - Google Art Project.jpg| Venus and Amor \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Adam \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Eve - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Eve \nFile:Hans Baldung - The Three Graces - WGA01196.jpg|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]\nFile:Hans Baldung called Grien - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg| Lucretia.

Near the end of his Nuremberg years, Grien oversaw the production by D\u00fcrer of stained glass, woodcuts and engravings, and therefore developed an affinity for these media and for the Nuremberg master's handing of them.\n\n==Strasbourg==\n\nIn 1509, when Baldung's time in Nuremberg was complete, he moved back to Strasbourg and became a [[Citizenship#Middle Ages|citizen there]]. He became a celebrity of the town, and received many important [[commissioner|commissions]].  The following year he married Margarethe Herlin, a local merchant's daughter,<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 305, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> joined the [[guild]] \"zur Steltz\", opened a workshop, and began signing his works with the HGB [[monogram]] that he used for the rest of his career. His style also became much more deliberately individual\u2014a tendency [[art historians]] used to term \"[[mannerist]].\"\n\n==Witchcraft and religious imagery==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0]]'']] \n\nIn addition to traditional religious subjects, Baldung was concerned during these years with the profane theme of the imminence of death and with scenes of sorcery and [[witchcraft]]. He helped introduce supernatural and [[Erotic art|erotic]] themes into German art, although these were already amply present in D\u00fcrer's work. Most famously, he depicted witches, also a local interest: Strasbourg's humanists studied witchcraft and its bishop was charged with finding and prosecuting witches. His most characteristic works in this area are small in scale and mostly in the medium of drawing; these include a series of puzzling, often erotic allegories and mythological works executed in pen and ink and white body color on prepared paper. The number of Hans Baldung's religious works diminished with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which generally repudiated church art as either wasteful or idolatrous. But earlier, around the same time that he produced an important chiaroscuro woodcut of Adam and Eve, the artist became interested in themes related to death, the supernatural, witchcraft, sorcery, and the relation between the sexes.  Baldung's fascination with witchcraft began early, with his first chiaroscuro print (1510) lasted to the end of his career.\n\nHans Baldung Grien's work depicting witches was produced in the first half of the 16th century, before [[witch hunting]] became a widespread cultural phenomenon in Europe. According to one view, Baldung's work did not represent widespread cultural beliefs at the time of creation but reflected largely individual choices.<ref name=\":0\">Sullivan, Margaret A. \u201cThe Witches of D\u00fcrer and Hans Baldung Grien.\u201d Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 53, no. 2, 2000, pp. 333\u2013401., www.jstor.org/stable/2901872.</ref> On the other hand, through his family, Baldung stood as closer to the leading intellectuals of the day than any of his contemporaries, and could draw on a burgeoning literature on witchcraft, as well as on developing juridical and forensic strategies for witch-hunting  <ref name=\":0\">Koerner, Joseph Leo. ''The Moment of Self-Portraiture in German Renaissance Art''.  Chicago, 1993.</ref>  Furthermore, Baldung never worked directly with any Reformation leaders to spread religious ideals through his artwork, although living in fervently religious Strasbourg,<ref>Rowlands, John. \"Washington and Yale. Hans Baldung Grien\", ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol. 123, no. 937, 1981, pp. 263\u2013263., [www.jstor.org/stable/880364 JSTOR]</ref> although he was a supporter of the movement, working on the high altar in the city of M\u00fcnster, Germany.<ref>Nenonen, Marko, and Raisa Maria Toivo, eds. ''Writing witch-hunt histories: challenging the paradigm''. Brill, 2013.</ref>\n\nBaldung was the first artist to heavily incorporate witches and witchcraft into his artwork (his mentor Albrecht D\u00fcrer had sporadically included them but not as prominently as Baldung would). During his lifetime there were few witch trials, therefore, some believe Baldung's depictions of witchcraft to be based on folklore rather than the cultural beliefs of his time. By contrast, throughout the early sixteenth century, [[humanism]] became very popular, and within this movement, Latin literature was valorized, particularly poetry and satire, some of which included views on witches that could be combined with witch lore massively accumulated in works such as the Malleus Maleficarum. Baldung partook in this culture, producing not only many works depicting Strasbourg humanists and scenes from ancient art and literature, but what an earlier literature on the artist described as his satirical take on his depiction of witches. Gert von der Osten comments on this aspect of \"Baldung [treating] his witches humorously, an attitude that reflects the dominant viewpoint of the humanists in Strasbourg at this time who viewed witchcraft as 'lustig,' a matter that was more amusing than serious\".<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the separation of a satirical tone from deadly serious vilifying intent proves difficult to maintain for Baldung as it is for many other artists, including his rough contemporary [[Hieronymus Bosch]].  Baldung's art simultaneously represents ideals presented in ancient Greek and Roman poetry, such as the pre-16th century notion that witches could control the weather, which Baldung is believed to have alluded to in his 1523 oil painting \"Weather Witches\", which showcases two attractive and naked witches in front of a stormy sky.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\nBaldung also regularly incorporated scenes of witches flying in his art, a characteristic that had been contested centuries before his artwork came into being. Flying was inherently attributed to witches by those who believed in the myth of the Sabbath (without their ability to fly, the myth fragmented), such as Baldung, which he depicted in works like \"Witches Preparing for the Sabbath Flight\" (1514).<ref>Hults, Linda C. \"Baldung and the Witches of Freiburg: The Evidence of Images\", ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', vol. 18, no. 2, 1987, pp. 249\u2013276., [www.jstor.org/stable/204283 JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Bildnis einer Dame (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza).jpg|thumb|Throughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations.]]\n\nThroughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations. While D\u00fcrer rigorously details his models, Baldung's style differs by focusing more on the personality of the represented character, an abstract conception of the model's state of mind. Baldung settled eventually in Strasbourg and then to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he executed what is held to be his masterpiece. Here in painted an eleven-panel altarpiece for the Freiburg Cathedral, still intact today, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, including, The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Flight into Egypt, The Crucifixion, Four Saints and The Donators. These depictions were a large part of the artist's greater body of work containing several renowned pieces of the Virgin.{{sfn|Cleef|1907}}\n\nThe earliest pictures assigned to him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram '''H. B.''' interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near [[Baden-Baden]]. Another early work is a portrait of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Maximilian]], drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at [[Karlsruhe]]. \"The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany\" (now Berlin, 1507), were painted for the market-church of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in Saxony.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nBaldung's [[old master print|prints]], though D\u00fcreresque, are very individual in style, and often in subject. They show little direct Italian influence. His paintings are less important than his prints. He worked mainly in [[woodcut]], although he made six [[engraving]]s, one very fine. He joined in the fashion for [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, adding a tone block to a woodcut of 1510.  Most of his hundreds of woodcuts were commissioned for books, as was usual at the time; his \"single-leaf\" woodcuts (i.e. prints not for book illustration) are fewer than 100, though no two catalogues agree as to the exact number.\n\nUnconventional as a draughtsman, his treatment of human form is often exaggerated and eccentric (hence his linkage, in the art historical literature, with European [[Mannerism]]), whilst his ornamental style\u2014profuse, eclectic, and akin to the self-consciously \"German\" strain of contemporary [[Tilia|limewood]] sculptors\u2014is equally distinctive.  Though Baldung has been commonly called the [[Correggio]] of the north, his compositions are a curious medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red and glowing green. Flesh is a mere glaze under which the features are indicated by lines.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nHis works are notable for their individualistic departure from the Renaissance composure of his model, D\u00fcrer, for the wild and fantastic strength that some of them display, and for their remarkable themes.  In the field of painting, his ''[[Eve, the Serpent and Death]]'' ([[National Gallery of Canada]]) shows his strengths well.  There is special force in the \"Death and the Maiden\" panel of 1517 (Basel), in the \"Weather Witches\" (Frankfurt), in the monumental panels of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" (Madrid), and in his many powerful portraits. Baldung's most sustained effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Twelve Apostles, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Flight into Egypt, and the Crucifixion, with [[donor portrait|portraits of donors]], are executed with some of that fanciful power that [[Martin Schongauer]] bequeathed to the [[Swabian school]].{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nAs a portrait painter he is well known. He drew [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as well as Maximilian; and his bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as early as 1514. At a later period he had sittings with Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children, and the picture containing these portraits is still in the gallery at Karlsruhe. Like D\u00fcrer and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], Baldung supported the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He was present at the [[diet of Augsburg]] in 1518, and one of his [[woodcut]]s represents [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in quasi-saintly guise, under the protection of (or being inspired by) the Holy Spirit, which hovers over him in the shape of a dove.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail) - WGA01206.jpg|thumb|Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail)]]\n\n*Two altar wings (Charles the Great, St. George), Augsburg, State Gallery.\n*The birth Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1510\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel,  1512\n*Death and the Maiden, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1517\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1512\n*The Lamentation of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1516\n*Pyramus and Thisbe, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, around 1530\n*The Mass of St. Gregory, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, 1511\n*Christ as a gardener, Darmstadt, Hessen State Museum, 1539\n*The Adoration of the Magi, Dessau, Anhalt Art Gallery, 1510\n*Adam and Eva, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi - Uffizi  \n*Frankfurt am Main, St\u00e4del The Baptism of Christ . 1518\n*Portrait of a youth, Hampton Court, Royal Collection  1509\n*The unlikely couple, Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, 1527\n*Portrait of a man, London, National Gallery, 1514 \n* [[The Three Ages of Man and Death]], Museo del Prado, Madrid\n*The Holy Trinity, London, National Gallery, 1512\n*Venus with Cupid, Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, 1525\n*Phyllis and Aristotle, Paris, Louvre . 1503\n*Stockholm, National Museum Mercury as a planet God . for 1530-1540\n*Vienna, Paintings Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts The Rest on the Flight into Egypt . 1513\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 135px\" caption=\"Selected works\">\nFile:Hans Baldung - Die Heilige Jungfrau als K\u00f6nigin des Himmels mit dem Christkind.jpg|The Virgin as Queen of Heaven with the Christ Child in her arms\nFile:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa - WGA01205.jpg|Mater Dolorosa \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|''Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten''\nFile:Baldung FR Hochaltar.02.JPG|Nativity\nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Venus and Amor - Google Art Project.jpg| Venus and Amor \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Adam \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Eve - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Eve \nFile:Hans Baldung - The Three Graces - WGA01196.jpg|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]\nFile:Hans Baldung called Grien - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg| Lucretia.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.\n\nUnlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians do not need ''Letters of Bourgeoisie'' to prove their status.\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris (but not in the [[suburb]]s) as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions of heritage, [[oath]] or other unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] for example.\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges are numerous, varied, sometimes ephemeral, and for the most part very variable according to the period, which in 1884 led to an author of ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious): \"The list of privileges of the bourgeois of Paris sometimes looks like an inventory \u00e0 la [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert|Pr\u00e9vert]] (with no connection to each other), and changes over the decades. \" Recently Laurence Croq, who has devoted a thesis to the study of the notion of the bourgeois of Paris in the 18th century, said that this quality had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.\n\nUnlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians do not need ''Letters of Bourgeoisie'' to prove their status.\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris (but not in the [[suburb]]s) as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions of heritage, [[oath]] or other unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] for example.\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges are numerous, varied, sometimes ephemeral, and for the most part very variable according to the period, which in 1884 led to an author of ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious): \"The list of privileges of the bourgeois of Paris sometimes looks like an inventory \u00e0 la [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert|Pr\u00e9vert]] (with no connection to each other), and changes over the decades. \" Recently Laurence Croq, who has devoted a thesis to the study of the notion of the bourgeois of Paris in the 18th century, said that this quality had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

But [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] restricted this privilege in 1577 to the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|Provost of the Merchants]] and the [[Alderman|Aldermen]] alone. It was suppressed in 1667, restored in 1707; suppressed again in 1715, and finally restored in 1716, as it stands today. \"<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Alexandre Aubert de La Chesnaye-Desbois, Dictionary of the nobility, Foreword, Volume I, Paris, 1770, p. IX.</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris enjoyed the right to the noble guard, called for them the bourgeois guard.\n\n== Birth of the bourgeoisie in Paris ==\nThe oldest [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporations]] or [[guild]]s in Paris were [[Tailor|clothiers]], [[grocers]], [[haberdasher]]s, and [[Fur clothing|furriers]].\n\nWith the water merchants, heirs of the ''nautes of Lut\u00e8ce'' who exercise the [[monopoly]] that holds the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] for the trade along the [[Seine]], and the ''Grande Boucherie'' (Big Butchery), which reunites the owners of farms of the suburbs and those of salting workshops intra and extramurals, they constitute alongside the [[clergy]] and the [[French nobility|nobility]] a [[Third estate|third power]] that will consecrate in 1357 the Great Ordinance of the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[\u00c9tienne Marcel|Etienne Marcel]], and which will become financially decisive, as the will illustrate the [[Cabochien revolt]].\n\nIn 1190, before going on a crusade, [[Philip II of France|King Philippe Auguste]] wrote his [[Will and testament|will]] and placed six \"loyal men\" at the head of the provost: Thibaut Le Riche, Athon de Greve, Evrouin Le Changeur, Robert de Chartres, Baudouin Bruneau and Nicolas Boucel.<ref>Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'', \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, coll. \u00ab Bouquins \u00bb, 1996, 1 590 <abbr>p.</abbr> ({{ISBN|978-2221078624}}).</ref>\n\nThe ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (Book of [[Tradesman|Trades]]) and the ''Livre de la taille'' (Book of the [[Taille]]), written under the provost of [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]], allow us to better understand this rising bourgeoisie. Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities.

{"title_page": "Wigwag (flag signals)", "text_new": "[[File:Civil War Signal Corps Kit.jpg|thumb|Wigwag flags, wigwag torches and kerosene canteen, and a signal rocket]]\n'''Wigwag''' (more formally, '''aerial telegraphy''') is an historical form of [[flag signals|flag signaling]] that passes messages by waving a single flag.  It differs from [[flag semaphore]] in that it uses one flag rather than two, and the symbols for each letter are represented by the motion of the flag rather than its position.  The larger flag and its motion allow messages to be read over greater distances than semaphore.  Messages could be sent at night using torches instead of flags.\n\nThe most common code used with wigwag had three motions, only two of which were needed to form letters of the alphabet.  These two were waving the flag, respectively, to the left and right \u2013 the wigwagging motion.  A [[Character (computing)|character]] was formed by sequentially displaying a number of motions (elements).  Like [[Morse code]], the number of elements in each character was not fixed, the most common letters being assigned the shortest codes.  A number of other codes were used at times, some of them with a fixed number of elements and up to four different motions.  Morse code was used with wigwag after it became an international standard.\n\nThe wigwag system was invented in the 1850s by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] who became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively by both sides in the [[American Civil War]] and continued to see use in both America and Europe until the end of the century.  After that, long distance communication was performed by [[electrical telegraphy]], or in some places where the telegraph was not available, by [[heliograph]].\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Wigwag motions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The basic wigwag signaling motions<ref>Myer (1866), plate F</ref>]]\nThe wigwag system consisted of a signalman waving a single large flag or other display device in different motions sequentially.  At night, a lamp on a pole could be used, or over short distances the signalman might hold a small disk.  The usual wigwag code was ternary, that is, there were three different motions (symbols) that could be displayed. However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary.  The third symbol only appeared in [[control character]]s.  The neutral position was the signalman holding the flag vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.<ref>Myer (1866), p. 83</ref>  Some sources define the movement to the left as \"1\" and to the right as \"2\" and list the code with \"1\" and \"2\" interchanged.<ref>Raines, p. 7</ref>\n\nLike [[Morse code]], the normal wigwag code did not have a fixed length (number of elements) for each [[Character (computing)|character]].  For instance, ''i'' was coded as \"1\", but ''d'' was coded as \"222\".<ref>Wolters, p. 10</ref>  The table shows the commonly used wigwag code and the diagram shows the flag motions.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 68</ref>  It is as defined in the [[General Service Code]] of July 1864 issued to standardize signals of the US Army and Navy.<ref>Raines, p. 13</ref>  Further details of the code and an alternate four-symbol representation are given in {{sectionlink|#Code details}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Wigwag code (General Service Code)\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\nThe elements of a character are performed rapidly without pause between them, only returning the flag to the rest position at the end of the character.<ref>{{multiref|Coe, p. 3|Myer (1866), pp. 53, 80}}</ref>  The US Army ''Manual of Signals'' lists several alternative codes, including a three-element fixed-length code using four symbols (1866 edition), and a three-element fixed-length code using three symbols (1872 edition). There is no indication in the manual that these codes were actually in use.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 97|Myer (1872), p. 96}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wigwag flag colours.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Available colors for wigwag flags]]\nWigwag has an advantage over [[flag semaphore]] in that only one flag is used instead of two.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref>  Thus, both arms could be used to raise the flag and a larger, heavier flag could be employed.  Nevertheless, signalmen required great strength to use a 4-foot flag on a 16-foot pole.  Even a light wind would multiply the difficulty and rain made the flag heavier.  Contemporary flags were heavier than modern equivalents, being made of linen<ref>Myer (1866), p. 176</ref> or cotton.  Modern large flags designed to be hand held might be made of lighter silk or nylon and are more resistant to moisture retention.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 159</ref>\n\n=== Flags and disks ===\nThe flags came in seven combinations of colors and sizes.  They were all square flags with a smaller square (one third the width) of a different color in the center.  The colors available were a white flag with a red center, a black flag with a white center, and a red flag with a white center.  All three were produced in the most commonly used four foot ({{nowrap|120 cm}}) size.  The white and black flags came in a six foot ({{nowrap|180 cm}}) size for greater range, and the white and red flags had a two foot ({{nowrap|60 cm}}) size.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 176|Raines, p. 13}}</ref>  The size and color of flag was chosen depending on lighting conditions and distance.  The white flag was the most common and was used against dark backgrounds.  Against light or varied backgrounds, the red flag was more effective and was also used at sea.<ref>{{multiref|Greely, pp. 308\u2013309|Thompson, p. 12|Raines, p. 14}}</ref>  The black flag was used against a background of snow.<ref>Greely, pp. 308\u2013309</ref>  The two foot flags, called ''action flags'', were used in situations where the signalman needed to stay under cover from enemy fire or wished to signal less obtrusively.<ref>Raines, p. 14</ref>  Each flag had a number of ties or tapes sewn along hoist edge.  These were used to fix the flag to a four-section staff, each section four feet long and fitted with ferrules for joining.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nThe disks were 12 to 18&nbsp;inches (30 to 46&nbsp;cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the heavy flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \"foot torch\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 176\u2013178</ref>  A 30X telescope was a standard part of the wigwag kit.  This was used by a signaler alongside the flagman to read the signals from the remote station, which could be at a distance of up to 20 miles.<ref>Thompson, p. 12</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe wigwag system filled a gap in the history of military communication between the age of close-quarter fighting and the age of modern long-range weapons.  In the 1860s, [[radio]] and [[telephone]] communications had yet to be invented and [[electrical telegraphy]], although established, was still in its infancy.  It was still being worked out how the latter could be used on the battlefield, and portable equipment ruggedized for military use was not available early in the decade.  Wigwag provided a method that was both simple to use and faster and more reliable than couriers.<ref>Raines, p. 31</ref>  By the start of [[World War I]], the range and accuracy of modern weapons had made flag signaling too dangerous to use on the front line, and more sophisticated technology was then available.<ref>Woods & Stirling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Albert J Myer in the field during American Civil War.png|thumb|Albert J. Myer (center) during the [[Peninsula campaign]] (1862)<ref>Raines, p. 24</ref> of the American Civil War]]\nThe wigwag system was invented by US Army surgeon Major [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s.  Myer took his inspiration from the [[telegraph code]] of [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], although the [[codepoint]]s finally used were not the same as Bain's.  The Bain code, invented 1843, was used on the chemical [[printing telegraph]] of that inventor and was a dot-dash code similar to the [[Morse code]].  Myer came across it while working as a [[telegraph operator]], work he did for a period after his graduation in 1847.  In 1851, Myer produced ''A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes'' as the thesis for his medical doctorate.  In this publication Myer used the Bain code as the basis for communication with a deaf person by tapping a hand or cheek.  Alternatively, tapping a table with which the person was also in contact could be used to pass messages.  In 1854, Myer joined the army as an assistant surgeon and was posted to Texas.  It was in Texas that he developed the idea of the wigwag flag or torch code for military use, building on his previous work with the deaf.<ref>{{multiref|Raines, p. 5|Chambers, p. 171}}</ref>\n\nIn 1856, while stationed at [[Fort Duncan]], Texas, Myer wrote to [[Jefferson Davis]], then [[Secretary of War]], proposing his signaling system.  He was supported by [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]] the Army [[Chief of Engineers]] but failed to get a hearing due to lack of detail in his proposal.  In 1857, Totten tried again with a new Secretary of War, [[John B. Floyd]].  In 1859, a board of examination under [[Robert E. Lee]] considered the proposal but thought it had only limited use.  They did not put it into operation but allowed Myer to continue with tests.  Myer conducted these tests starting in April, initially at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia, and later in New York and Washington.<ref>Raines, p. 6</ref>\n\nMyer, with Floyd's support, proposed that a new post of signal officer to the Army staff should be created, with him filling it.  In February 1860, Myer got a hearing before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs under the chairmanship of Jefferson Davis which supported the introduction of the system.  Davis opposed the creation of the signal officer post when it came before congress; he wanted to use the signaling system but feared the creation of the signal officer post would lead to the creation of a new department (the future [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]).  Davis's objections were ignored and Myer was made signal officer and promoted to major in June 1860.<ref>Raines, p. 6\u20137</ref>  Myer submitted a patent application in 1860 claiming the rights to all signaling systems based on motions (of which wigwag is an example) as opposed to positions (of which flag semaphore is an example).  The patent was granted in January 1861.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n=== In service ===\n[[File:Signal station Elk Mountain.jpg|thumb|upright|A wigwag station on [[Elk Ridge (Maryland)|Elk Ridge]], Maryland, during the [[Battle of Antietam]]]]\nThe first live use of the system was in 1860 in a campaign against the [[Navajo]] in the [[Department of New Mexico]].  Myer served under Major [[Edward Canby]] who became a strong supporter of the formation of a signal corps, which he thought more efficient than Myer's proposal to train every officer.  The Navajo war was over by February 1861, but at the same time the [[American Civil War]] was beginning.  Up to this point, Myer had been temporarily assigned men from the units in which he served to work as signalers, often grudgingly.  This was impractical for a large scale war and Myer now pressed for Canby's idea of a dedicated signal corps.  Many in Washington opposed the idea, and it took until 3 March 1863 before the Signal Corps was formally inaugurated, although the signalers had been informally called \"signal corps\" for some time.  Myer was put in charge with the rank of Colonel.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u201313</ref>\n\n==== Civil War ====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14782789933).jpg|thumb|upright|The Cobb's Hill wigwag tower, 1864]]\nWigwag was used extensively by [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|Civil War Signal Corps]] troops on both sides.<ref>Raines, pp. 23\u201329</ref>  Its first use in battle was by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant [[Edward Porter Alexander]] (a former pupil of Myer)<ref>Greely, p. 313</ref> at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.<ref>Alexander, pp. 3, 4, 14\u201316, 30\u201331</ref>  The signalmen on this occasion fulfilled an important function by reporting a Union attempt to turn the Confederate flank.<ref>Rauch, p. 102</ref>  Myer had originally promoted the idea as a lightweight mobile system that could be carried by a single man.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref> \u2013 a common task for signalmen was to act as forward observers reporting artillery fall of shot.<ref>Raines, p. 9</ref>  As the war progressed, more substantial stations were constructed.  Enormous towers, some well over 100 feet, were built.<ref>Myer (1866), frontispiece</ref>  The Cobb's Hill tower shown in the image was built by the [[Appomattox River]] in June 1864.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>  Wherever possible, existing structures were used.  Building stations in trees was common, and church steeples were often used.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The system, at least on the Union side, took on the nature of a genuine communications network.<ref>Berkowitz, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  The Confederates, despite being first in the field with wigwag, and the Union side being slow to get going, never succeeded in building a network to the same extent.  The Confederate Signal Corps was simply not given resources on the same scale.<ref>Raines, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe mere existence of a flag station could cause problems for the enemy.  Alexander, in his memoirs, referred to the [[Little Round Top]] station as \"that wretched little signal station\" because he was forced to make roundabout movements of his troops and artillery to avoid being observed (at this time, 1863, Alexander was no longer connected with the Signal Corps, but was in command of the artillery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>Heidler & Heidler</ref>).  The Confederates had tried but failed to seize the position several times, including during [[Pickett's Charge]] in 1863.  During that action Captain Davis E. Castle continued to signal with a bedsheet after the flagman had retreated with the flags.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The 125 ft height of the Cobbs Hill tower gave it such a good view of Confederate movements that they assigned a gun battery specifically to destroy it.  They failed to achieve this and the tower remained in use until the fall of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]].<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>\n\nSignalmen were sometimes assigned to ships to maintain communication between the navy and land forces.  On large operations they might also be used for ship-to-ship communication.  The signalman was posted high up on the masthead of the ship.  This was especially common on operations concerning the [[Mississippi River]] such as the [[Vicksburg campaign]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].<ref>Raines, p. 27</ref>\n[[File:UnionCipherDisk.nsa.jpg|thumb|upright|A Union cipher disk]]\nThe fact that the Confederates had personnel able to read the wigwag code was problematic for the Union side.  Security concerns led to a reluctance to send important messages by flag signals.  General [[Daniel Butterfield]] went so far as to order the [[Army of the Potomac]] not to use signals at all, much to the concern of its chief signal officer [[Benjamin F, Fisher]].  To overcome this problem, the Signal Corps created a [[cipher disk]] to encode messages.  It is believed that the Confederates never broke this code.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The Union side was able to read Confederate flag signals without being discovered until at least 1864 when Myer's successor as head of the Signal Corps, [[William J. L. Nicodemus]], published the fact in a pamphlet.  Nicodemus was dismissed in December 1864 for this breach of security and replaced by Fisher.<ref>Raines, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nMyer did not use the term ''wigwag'' in the manuals he produced.  He called the system ''aerial signals''<ref>Myer (1872), p. </ref> or ''aerial telegraphy''.<ref>Thompson, p. 13</ref>  The system probably came to be known as wigwag because of the apparently random motions of the flag as seen by an untrained observer.<ref name=museum>US Army Signal Museum, \"Crossed flags: History of the wigwag\", United States Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707002941/http://www.gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/csrdflag.asp archived] 7 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==== Signal station gallery ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Wigwag 130 ft tower.png|A 130 foot wigwag tower used in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag 125 ft tower.png|125 ft wigwag tower used in operations against Richmond<ref>Myer (1866), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag masthead signal station, Richmond.png|Wigwag station on the masthead of a US ship at Richmond<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag station near Washington.png|Wigwag station near Washington<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag tree station, upper Potomac.png|Wigwag station in a tree on the [[Upper Potomac River]]<ref>Myer (1872), fronispiece</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other campaigns ====\nThe Civil War was the high point of the use of wigwag, but there were some other campaigns that included flag signalmen, mainly against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  Signal parties accompanied general [[Patrick E. Connor]] on the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865 in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]].  The signalmen were used to maintain communications between troop columns.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The campaign was a punitive expedition against the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]<ref>McDermott, p.6</ref> in retaliation for raiding and disrupting travel on the [[Bozeman Trail]].  The expedition was a large operation consisting of three separate columns approaching from different directions.<ref>Coutant, ch. 36</ref>\n\nWigwag was taken up by some European countries, notably the British in African colonial wars.  It was used extensively in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.  Once [[Morse code]] became an international standard, the British dropped the Myer code for wigwag signaling and used Morse instead with the flag movements indicating dots and dashes.  The French had a slight variation of that, using a single flag for ''dot'' and two flags for ''dash''.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n[[File:Sign (8037141146).jpg|thumb|upright|US Army Signal Corp insignia featuring crossed wigwag flags and torch]]\n{{see also|Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Telegraph train and the Beardslee telegraph}}\n\nEven while the Civil War was still in progress, the electrical telegraph was starting to displace flag signaling.  This perhaps did not happen as quickly as it might have done because the US Military Telegraph was not put under the control of the Signal Corps.  Myer made repeated attempts to absorb the Military Telegraph but failed due to political rivalries.  Nevertheless, Myer was able to institute ''telegraph trains'' (that is, trains of wagons, not rail locomotives) that carried a combination of electrical telegraph and flag equipment.  The original idea was to use the [[Morse telegraph]] in the trains, but due to the unavailability of trained Morse operators to Myer, the contractor, [[Henry J. Rogers]], replaced the Morse key and sounder with a circular alphabet and pointer of his own design that could be operated by any literate person.  A further change was the replacement of acid batteries for power with a hand-cranked [[electrical generator]] invented by [[George W. Beardslee]].<ref>Raines, pp. 16\u201318</ref>  Although these changes made use in the field easier, they had serious disadvantages.  The Rogers alphabet system slowed down the speed of transmission, and the Beardslee generator was only powerful enough for short distances.  These problems resulted in occasions when the Signal Corps had to turn over its lines to the Military Telegraph with their superior equipment.  After the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863 where these problems were apparent, Myer tried to recruit Morse operators through advertisements.  However, this just resulted in Myer's dismissal for exceeding his authority, and replacement by Nicodemus.  The inability of the Signal Corps to fully adopt the electrical telegraph ensured that flag signals remained in widespread use throughout the war.<ref>Raines, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nMyer's code remained in use in the US until 1886 when it was replaced by Morse code.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 15</ref>  It came back into use after 1896,<ref name=museum/> but was officially discontinued in 1912 when [[International Morse code]] was mandated for all types of visual signaling. Inconsistently, [[American Morse code]] was mandated for Army electrical telegraph lines, but not for [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Coe, p. 3</ref>  The wigwag method was superseded by [[flag semaphore]] for short distances, and the [[heliograph]] for long distances in regions where the electrical telegraph was not available.  The heliograph saw widespread use in Arizona and New Mexico after [[Nelson A.

It differs from [[flag semaphore]] in that it uses one flag rather than two, and the symbols for each letter are represented by the motion of the flag rather than its position.  The larger flag and its motion allow messages to be read over greater distances than semaphore.  Messages could be sent at night using torches instead of flags.\n\nThe most common code used with wigwag had three motions, only two of which were needed to form letters of the alphabet.  These two were waving the flag, respectively, to the left and right \u2013 the wigwagging motion.  A [[Character (computing)|character]] was formed by sequentially displaying a number of motions (elements).  Like [[Morse code]], the number of elements in each character was not fixed, the most common letters being assigned the shortest codes.  A number of other codes were used at times, some of them with a fixed number of elements and up to four different motions.  Morse code was used with wigwag after it became an international standard.\n\nThe wigwag system was invented in the 1850s by US Army surgeon [[Albert J. Myer]] who became the first head of the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].  Wigwag was used extensively by both sides in the [[American Civil War]] and continued to see use in both America and Europe until the end of the century.  After that, long distance communication was performed by [[electrical telegraphy]], or in some places where the telegraph was not available, by [[heliograph]].\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Wigwag motions.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The basic wigwag signaling motions<ref>Myer (1866), plate F</ref>]]\nThe wigwag system consisted of a signalman waving a single large flag or other display device in different motions sequentially.  At night, a lamp on a pole could be used, or over short distances the signalman might hold a small disk.  The usual wigwag code was ternary, that is, there were three different motions (symbols) that could be displayed. However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary.  The third symbol only appeared in [[control character]]s.  The neutral position was the signalman holding the flag vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman's right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position.<ref>Myer (1866), p. 83</ref>  Some sources define the movement to the left as \"1\" and to the right as \"2\" and list the code with \"1\" and \"2\" interchanged.<ref>Raines, p. 7</ref>\n\nLike [[Morse code]], the normal wigwag code did not have a fixed length (number of elements) for each [[Character (computing)|character]].  For instance, ''i'' was coded as \"1\", but ''d'' was coded as \"222\".<ref>Wolters, p. 10</ref>  The table shows the commonly used wigwag code and the diagram shows the flag motions.<ref>Myer (1872), p. 68</ref>  It is as defined in the [[General Service Code]] of July 1864 issued to standardize signals of the US Army and Navy.<ref>Raines, p. 13</ref>  Further details of the code and an alternate four-symbol representation are given in {{sectionlink|#Code details}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Wigwag code (General Service Code)\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\nThe elements of a character are performed rapidly without pause between them, only returning the flag to the rest position at the end of the character.<ref>{{multiref|Coe, p. 3|Myer (1866), pp. 53, 80}}</ref>  The US Army ''Manual of Signals'' lists several alternative codes, including a three-element fixed-length code using four symbols (1866 edition), and a three-element fixed-length code using three symbols (1872 edition). There is no indication in the manual that these codes were actually in use.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 97|Myer (1872), p. 96}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wigwag flag colours.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Available colors for wigwag flags]]\nWigwag has an advantage over [[flag semaphore]] in that only one flag is used instead of two.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref>  Thus, both arms could be used to raise the flag and a larger, heavier flag could be employed.  Nevertheless, signalmen required great strength to use a 4-foot flag on a 16-foot pole.  Even a light wind would multiply the difficulty and rain made the flag heavier.  Contemporary flags were heavier than modern equivalents, being made of linen<ref>Myer (1866), p. 176</ref> or cotton.  Modern large flags designed to be hand held might be made of lighter silk or nylon and are more resistant to moisture retention.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 159</ref>\n\n=== Flags and disks ===\nThe flags came in seven combinations of colors and sizes.  They were all square flags with a smaller square (one third the width) of a different color in the center.  The colors available were a white flag with a red center, a black flag with a white center, and a red flag with a white center.  All three were produced in the most commonly used four foot ({{nowrap|120 cm}}) size.  The white and black flags came in a six foot ({{nowrap|180 cm}}) size for greater range, and the white and red flags had a two foott ({{nowrap|60 cm}}) size.<ref>{{multiref|Myer (1866), p. 176|Raines, p. 13}}</ref>  The size and color of flag was chosen depending on lighting conditions and distance.  The white flag was the most common and was used against dark backgrounds.  Against light or varied backgrounds, the red flag was more effective and was also used at sea.<ref>{{multiref|Greely, pp. 308\u2013309|Thompson, p. 12|Raines, p. 14}}</ref>  The black flag was used against a background of snow.<ref>Greely, pp. 308\u2013309</ref>  The two foot flags, called ''action flags'', were used in situations where the signalman needed to stay under cover from enemy fire or wished to signal less obtrusively.<ref>Raines, p. 14</ref>  Each flag had a number of ties or tapes sewn along hoist edge.  These were used to fix the flag to a four-section staff, each section four feet long and fitted with ferrules for joining.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nThe disks were 12 to 18&nbsp;inches (30 to 46&nbsp;cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the heavy flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second \"foot torch\" was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern's movements.<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 176\u2013178</ref>  A 30X telescope was a standard part of the wigwag kit.  This was used by a signaler alongside the flagman to read the signals from the remote station, which could be at a distance of up to 20 miles.<ref>Thompson, p. 12</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe wigwag system filled a gap in the history of military communication between the age of close-quarter fighting and the age of modern long-range weapons.  In the 1860s, [[radio]] and [[telephone]] communications had yet to be invented and [[electrical telegraphy]], although established, was still in its infancy.  It was still being worked out how the latter could be used on the battlefield, and portable equipment ruggedized for military use was not available early in the decade.  Wigwag provided a method that was both simple to use and faster and more reliable than couriers.<ref>Raines, p. 31</ref>  By the start of [[World War I]], the range and accuracy of modern weapons had made flag signaling too dangerous to use on the front line, and more sophisticated technology was then available.<ref>Woods & Stirling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Albert J Myer in the field during American Civil War.png|thumb|Albert J. Myer (center) during the [[Peninsula campaign]] (1862)<ref>Raines, p. 24</ref> of the American Civil War]]\nThe wigwag system was invented by US Army surgeon Major [[Albert J. Myer]] in the 1850s.  Myer took his inspiration from the [[telegraph code]] of [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]], although the [[codepoint]]s finally used were not the same as Bain's.  The Bain code, invented 1843, was used on the chemical [[printing telegraph]] of that inventor and was a dot-dash code similar to the [[Morse code]].  Myer came across it while working as a [[telegraph operator]], work he did for a period after his graduation in 1847.  In 1851, Myer produced ''A New Sign Language for Deaf Mutes'' as the thesis for his medical doctorate.  In this publication Myer used the Bain code as the basis for communication with a deaf person by tapping a hand or cheek.  Alternatively, tapping a table with which the person was also in contact could be used to pass messages.  In 1854, Myer joined the army as an assistant surgeon and was posted to Texas.  It was in Texas that he developed the idea of the wigwag flag or torch code for military use, building on his previous work with the deaf.<ref>{{multiref|Raines, p. 5|Chambers, p. 171}}</ref>\n\nIn 1856, while stationed at [[Fort Duncan]], Texas, Myer wrote to [[Jefferson Davis]], then [[Secretary of War]], proposing his signaling system.  He was supported by [[Joseph Gilbert Totten]] the Army [[Chief of Engineers]] but failed to get a hearing due to lack of detail in his proposal.  In 1857, Totten tried again with a new Secretary of War, [[John B. Floyd]].  In 1859, a board of examination under [[Robert E. Lee]] considered the proposal but thought it had only limited use.  They did not put it into operation but allowed Myer to continue with tests.  Myer conducted these tests starting in April, initially at [[Fort Monroe]], Virginia, and later in New York and Washington.<ref>Raines, p. 6</ref>\n\nMyer, with Floyd's support, proposed that a new post of signal officer to the Army staff should be created, with him filling it.  In February 1860, Myer got a hearing before the Senate Committee on Military Affairs under the chairmanship of Jefferson Davis which supported the introduction of the system.  Davis opposed the creation of the signal officer post when it came before congress; he wanted to use the signaling system but feared the creation of the signal officer post would lead to the creation of a new department (the future [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]]).  Davis's objections were ignored and Myer was made signal officer and promoted to major in June 1860.<ref>Raines, p. 6\u20137</ref>  Myer submitted a patent application in 1860 claiming the rights to all signaling systems based on motions (of which wigwag is an example) as opposed to positions (of which flag semaphore is an example).  The patent was granted in January 1861.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u20138</ref>\n\n=== In service ===\n[[File:Signal station Elk Mountain.jpg|thumb|upright|A wigwag station on [[Elk Ridge (Maryland)|Elk Ridge]], Maryland, during the [[Battle of Antietam]]]]\nThe first live use of the system was in 1860 in a campaign against the [[Navajo]] in the [[Department of New Mexico]].  Myer served under Major [[Edward Canby]] who became a strong supporter of the formation of a signal corps, which he thought more efficient than Myer's proposal to train every officer.  The Navajo war was over by February 1861, but at the same time the [[American Civil War]] was beginning.  Up to this point, Myer had been temporarily assigned men from the units in which he served to work as signalers, often grudgingly.  This was impractical for a large scale war and Myer now pressed for Canby's idea of a dedicated signal corps.  Many in Washington opposed the idea, and it took until 3 March 1863 before the Signal Corps was formally inaugurated, although the signalers had been informally called \"signal corps\" for some time.  Myer was put in charge with the rank of Colonel.<ref>Raines, pp. 7\u201313</ref>\n\n==== Civil War ====\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14782789933).jpg|thumb|upright|The Cobb's Hill wigwag tower, 1864]]\nWigwag was used extensively by [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|Civil War Signal Corps]] troops on both sides.<ref>Raines, pp. 23\u201329</ref>  Its first use in battle was by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Lieutenant [[Edward Porter Alexander]] (a former pupil of Myer)<ref>Greely, p. 313</ref> at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861.<ref>Alexander, pp. 3, 4, 14\u201316, 30\u201331</ref>  The signalmen on this occasion fulfilled an important function by reporting a Union attempt to turn the Confederate flank.<ref>Rauch, p. 102</ref>  Myer had originally promoted the idea as a lightweight mobile system that could be carried by a single man.<ref>Raines, p. 5</ref> \u2013 a common task for signalmen was to act as forward observers reporting artillery fall of shot.<ref>Raines, p. 9</ref>  As the war progressed, more substantial stations were constructed.  Enormous towers, some well over 100 feet, were built.<ref>Myer (1866), frontispiece</ref>  The Cobb's Hill tower shown in the image was built by the [[Appomattox River]] in June 1864.<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>  Wherever possible, existing structures were used.  Building stations in trees was common, and church steeples were often used.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The system, at least on the Union side, took on the nature of a genuine communications network.<ref>Berkowitz, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  The Confederates, despite being first in the field with wigwag, and the Union side being slow to get going, never succeeded in building a network to the same extent.  The Confederate Signal Corps was simply not given resources on the same scale.<ref>Raines, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe mere existence of a flag station could cause problems for the enemy.  Alexander, in his memoirs, referred to the [[Little Round Top]] station as \"that wretched little signal station\" because he was forced to make roundabout movements of his troops and artillery to avoid being observed (at this time, 1863, Alexander was no longer connected with the Signal Corps, but was in command of the artillery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]<ref>Heidler & Heidler</ref>).  The Confederates had tried but failed to seize the position several times, including during [[Pickett's Charge]] in 1863.  During that action Captain Davis E. Castle continued to signal with a bedsheet after the flagman had retreated with the flags.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The 125 ft height of the Cobbs Hill tower gave it such a good view of Confederate movements that they assigned a gun battery specifically to destroy it.  They failed to achieve this and the tower remained in use until the fall of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]].<ref>Greely, p. 311</ref>\n\nSignalmen were sometimes assigned to ships to maintain communication between the navy and land forces.  On large operations they might also be used for ship-to-ship communication.  The signalman was posted high up on the masthead of the ship.  This was especially common on operations concerning the [[Mississippi River]] such as the [[Vicksburg campaign]] and the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].<ref>Raines, p. 27</ref>\n[[File:UnionCipherDisk.nsa.jpg|thumb|upright|A Union cipher disk]]\nThe fact that the Confederates had personnel able to read the wigwag code was problematic for the Union side.  Security concerns led to a reluctance to send important messages by flag signals.  General [[Daniel Butterfield]] went so far as to order the [[Army of the Potomac]] not to use signals at all, much to the concern of its chief signal officer [[Benjamin F, Fisher]].  To overcome this problem, the Signal Corps created a [[cipher disk]] to encode messages.  It is believed that the Confederates never broke this code.<ref>Raines, p. 16</ref>  The Union side was able to read Confederate flag signals without being discovered until at least 1864 when Myer's successor as head of the Signal Corps, [[William J. L. Nicodemus]], published the fact in a pamphlet.  Nicodemus was dismissed in December 1864 for this breach of security and replaced by Fisher.<ref>Raines, pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nMyer did not use the term ''wigwag'' in the manuals he produced.  He called the system ''aerial signals''<ref>Myer (1872), p. </ref> or ''aerial telegraphy''.<ref>Thompson, p. 13</ref>  The system probably came to be known as wigwag because of the apparently random motions of the flag as seen by an untrained observer.<ref name=museum>US Army Signal Museum, \"Crossed flags: History of the wigwag\", United States Army Signal Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070707002941/http://www.gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/csrdflag.asp archived] 7 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==== Signal station gallery ====\n<gallery>\nFile:Wigwag 130 ft tower.png|A 130 foot wigwag tower used in operations against [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag 125 ft tower.png|125 ft wigwag tower used in operations against Richmond<ref>Myer (1866), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag masthead signal station, Richmond.png|Wigwag station on the masthead of a US ship at Richmond<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag station near Washington.png|Wigwag station near Washington<ref>Myer (1868), fronispiece</ref>\nFile:Wigwag tree station, upper Potomac.png|Wigwag station in a tree on the [[Upper Potomac River]]<ref>Myer (1872), fronispiece</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==== Other campaigns ====\nThe Civil War was the high point of the use of wigwag, but there were some other campaigns that included flag signalmen, mainly against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].  Signal parties accompanied general [[Patrick E. Connor]] on the [[Powder River Expedition (1865)|Powder River Expedition]] of 1865 in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]].  The signalmen were used to maintain communications between troop columns.<ref>Raines, pp. 26\u201327</ref>  The campaign was a punitive expedition against the [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]]<ref>McDermott, p.6</ref> in retaliation for raiding and disrupting travel on the [[Bozeman Trail]].  The expedition was a large operation consisting of three separate columns approaching from different directions.<ref>Coutant, ch. 36</ref>\n\nWigwag was taken up by some European countries, notably the British in African colonial wars.  It was used extensively in the [[Boer War]] in South Africa.  Once [[Morse code]] became an international standard, the British dropped the Myer code for wigwag signaling and used Morse instead with the flag movements indicating dots and dashes.  The French had a slight variation of that, using a single flag for ''dot'' and two flags for ''dash''.<ref>Woods & Sterling, p. 160</ref>\n\n=== Withdrawal ===\n[[File:Sign (8037141146).jpg|thumb|upright|US Army Signal Corp insignia featuring crossed wigwag flags and torch]]\n{{see also|Signal Corps in the American Civil War#Telegraph train and the Beardslee telegraph}}\n\nEven while the Civil War was still in progress, the electrical telegraph was starting to displace flag signaling.  This perhaps did not happen as quickly as it might have done because the US Military Telegraph was not put under the control of the Signal Corps.  Myer made repeated attempts to absorb the Military Telegraph but failed due to political rivalries.  Nevertheless, Myer was able to institute ''telegraph trains'' (that is, trains of wagons, not rail locomotives) that carried a combination of electrical telegraph and flag equipment.  The original idea was to use the [[Morse telegraph]] in the trains, but due to the unavailability of trained Morse operators to Myer, the contractor, [[Henry J. Rogers]], replaced the Morse key and sounder with a circular alphabet and pointer of his own design that could be operated by any literate person.  A further change was the replacement of acid batteries for power with a hand-cranked [[electrical generator]] invented by [[George W. Beardslee]].<ref>Raines, pp. 16\u201318</ref>  Although these changes made use in the field easier, they had serious disadvantages.  The Rogers alphabet system slowed down the speed of transmission, and the Beardslee generator was only powerful enough for short distances.  These problems resulted in occasions when the Signal Corps had to turn over its lines to the Military Telegraph with their superior equipment.  After the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in 1863 where these problems were apparent, Myer tried to recruit Morse operators through advertisements.  However, this just resulted in Myer's dismissal for exceeding his authority, and replacement by Nicodemus.  The inability of the Signal Corps to fully adopt the electrical telegraph ensured that flag signals remained in widespread use throughout the war.<ref>Raines, pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nMyer's code remained in use in the US until 1886 when it was replaced by Morse code.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 15</ref>  It came back into use after 1896,<ref name=museum/> but was officially discontinued in 1912 when [[International Morse code]] was mandated for all types of visual signaling. Inconsistently, [[American Morse code]] was mandated for Army electrical telegraph lines, but not for [[radio telegraphy]].<ref>Coe, p. 3</ref>  The wigwag method was superseded by [[flag semaphore]] for short distances, and the [[heliograph]] for long distances in regions where the electrical telegraph was not available.  The heliograph saw widespread use in Arizona and New Mexico after [[Nelson A. Miles]] took over command of the campaign against the [[Apache]] in 1886.<ref>Miles, pp. 481\u2013484</ref>  In good conditions, the heliograph could transmit over distances as great as 50 miles.  This is far in excess of anything achievable with flag signaling.<ref>Woods, pp. 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n== Code details ==\n=== Two-symbol code (General Service Code) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flag motions<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 55\u201356, plates E, F</ref>\n|-\n!Symbol!!Motion\n|-\n|1||Wave flag to ground on right\n|-\n|2||Wave flag to ground on left\n|-\n|3||Dip flag to ground in front\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Letters\n|-\n!A!!B!!C!!D!!E!!F!!G!!H!!I!!J!!K!!L!!M\n|-\n|22||2112||121||222||12||2221||2211||122||1||1122||2121||221||1221\n|-\n|\n|-\n!N!!O!!P!!Q!!R!!S!!T!!U!!V!!W!!X!!Y!!Z\n|-\n|11||21||1212||1211||211||212||2||112||1222||1121||2122||111||2222\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common words and syllables<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 53\u201354</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|1111||&\n|-\n|2212||ing\n|-\n|1112||tion\n|-\n|a||after\n|-\n|b||before\n|-\n|c||can\n|-\n|h||have\n|-\n|n||not\n|-\n|r||are\n|-\n|t||the\n|-\n|u||you\n|-\n|ur||your\n|-\n|w||word\n|-\n|wi||with\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Controls<ref>Myer (1866), pp. 54\u201355</ref>\n|-\n!Codepoint!!Meaning\n|-\n|3||End of word\n|-\n|33||End of sentence\n|-\n|333||End of message\n|-\n|22.22.22.3||Understood\n|-\n|22.22.22.333||Stop sending\n|-\n|121.121.121||Repeat\n|-\n|212121||Error\n|-\n|211.211.211||Move to the right\n|-\n|221.221.221||Move to the left\n|-\n|Continuos waving||Attention\n|-\n|Two circles to right||End of address\n|-\n|Two circles to left||Start of signature\n|}\n\nNumerals could represent a control signal as well as a number.

Among guitar and bass accessories, the company sells active humbucker pickups, such as the [[EMG 81]],<ref name=\"humbucker\"/> the [[EMG 85]], the [[EMG 60]], and the [[EMG 89]]. They also produce passive pickups such as the [[EMG HZ|EMG-HZ Series]], which include SRO-OC1's and SC Sets.

It was originally called Dirtywork Studios, and their first pickup was the same as their current 2011 model of EMG H and EMG HA models. The active [[humbucking]] pickup EMG 58 followed soon after. The name was changed to \"Overlend\"<ref name=\"wylde\"/> (spelled \"Overland\" in some sources<ref name=\"book\"/>) in 1978. However, its products have always been called EMG pickups.\n\nIn 1981, EMG active pickups became standard equipment on [[Steinberger]] basses and guitars. According to Hap Kuffner, EMG pickups originally had widespread success in [[Europe]], after first exhibiting at the 1983 [[Musikmesse]] tradeshow in Germany. The name was changed to EMG, Inc. in 1983<ref name=\"wylde\"/> (\"EMG\" stands for \"[[Electromagnetism|Electro-Magnetic]] [[Electrical generator|Generator]]\"<ref name=\"emg-history\"/>). As Steinberger guitars became more popular among American metal and rock musicians, so did EMG pickups, and vice versa.<ref name=\"wylde\"/>\n\nEarly EMG pickup designs were made with a bar magnet inside for two reasons.

Among guitar and bass accessories, the company sells active humbucker pickups, such as the [[EMG 81]],<ref name=\"humbucker\"/> the [[EMG 85]], the [[EMG 60]], and the [[EMG 89]]. They also produce passive pickups such as the [[EMG HZ|EMG-HZ Series]], which include SRO-OC1's and SC Sets. There is also a series geared towards a more traditional and passive sound known as the X series.\n\nTheir active pickups are most popular among [[hard rock]] and [[metal (music)|metal]] artists<ref name=\"humbucker\"/> such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Zakk Wylde]], [[Sepultura]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Exodus_(American_band)|Exodus]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[Death Angel]], [[Cryptopsy]], [[Malevolent Creation]] and [[Primus (band)|Primus]] but also used by others such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Kyle Sokol]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Steve Lukather]] and [[David Gilmour]].<ref name=\"artistlist\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded in 1976 by Rob Turner in [[Long Beach, California]]. It was originally called Dirtywork Studios, and their first pickup was the same as their current 2011 model of EMG H and EMG HA models. The active [[humbucking]] pickup EMG 58 followed soon after. The name was changed to \"Overlend\"<ref name=\"wylde\"/> (spelled \"Overland\" in some sources<ref name=\"book\"/>) in 1978. However, its products have always been called EMG pickups.\n\nIn 1981, EMG active pickups became standard equipment on [[Steinberger]] basses and guitars. According to Hap Kuffner, EMG pickups originally had widespread success in [[Europe]], after first exhibiting at the 1983 [[Musikmesse]] tradeshow in Germany. The name was changed to EMG, Inc. in 1983<ref name=\"wylde\"/> (\"EMG\" stands for \"[[Electromagnetism|Electro-Magnetic]] [[Electrical generator|Generator]]\"<ref name=\"emg-history\"/>). As Steinberger guitars became more popular among American metal and rock musicians, so did EMG pickups, and vice versa.<ref name=\"wylde\"/>\n\nEarly EMG pickup designs were made with a bar magnet inside for two reasons. The first reason is that the pole pieces had too much magnetism on the strings and could cause some lower notes to go out of pitch in a [[Doppler effect]]. The second reason is that the pole pieces can make tuning and placement of the strings much more difficult. Using the bar magnet however gave the strings a more balanced output. The design of the bar magnet gives it a smoother distortion, better sustain through the amplifier, and have less fade onto the strings than the design of pole pieces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emgpickups.com/pdfs/EMG_Catalog.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729142420/http://www.emgpickups.com/pdfs/EMG_Catalog.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Products ==\n\n===Overview===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EMG 81.png|thumb|[[EMG-81]]: one of the most popular active EMG pickups]] -->EMG [[guitar pickup|pickups]] are standard equipment on some models from guitar manufacturers such as [[BC Rich]], [[ESP Guitars|ESP]], [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]], [[Cort Guitars|Cort]], [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Dean Guitar|Dean]], [[Ibanez]], and [[Jackson Guitars]].<ref name=\"wylde\"/> In addition to pickups, EMG Inc. also has a line of guitar and bass accessories, mainly for altering [[equalization (audio)|equalization settings]] such as [[Bass (sound)|bass]]/treble and gain boosting, and designed to work with most pickups.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 52,160.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22099.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The parish was founded in 1811.\n\nSt. Martin Parish is part of the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. 27% of the population of St. Martin Parish have [[French language|French]] fluency, rated as one of the highest concentrations of French speakers in the nation.\n\n==History==\nIn 1811, the division of [[Attakapas County, Orleans Territory|Attakapas Parish]] created St. Martin Parish and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]].  In 1824, St. Martin Parish was divided, resulting in the creation of [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]].  In 1844, St. Martin Parish was again divided, creating [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion Parish]].  In 1868, [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was formed from parts of St. Martin Parish and St. Mary Parish, literally dividing St. Martin Parish in two, as part of Iberia Parish runs between the two non-contiguous parts of St. Martin Parish.\n\nSt. Martin Parish was largely colonized by people from France and [[Acadia]] in the 1700s, accounting for the large concentration of French-speaking population today.  The Acadians brought with them the tale of Evangeline, a young woman who was separated from her supposedly-mortally-wounded betrothed during the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]]. According to the tale, Evangeline later met her betrothed in St. Martin Parish, but he had moved on to a new love and she never recovered from the shock of both finding him and losing him again.  [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s most famous work, [[Evangeline|'''''Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie''''']], was based on this story.  Evangeline was and remains an icon of Acadian and American culture.  The historical Evangeline, who is believed by some to have been an orphan girl named Emmeline Labiche, is supposed to have been buried on the grounds of the St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church in St. Martinville.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southwestlouisia00perr|title=Southwest Louisiana, biographical and historical|last=Perrin|first=William Henry|date=1891|publisher=New Orleans : Gulf Publishing Co.|others=The Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nSt. Martin was a very prosperous parish, growing rapidly in the early 1800s.  Most of the money at that time was being made by raising cattle.  Other profitable crops were cotton, sugar, corn, rice and tobacco.  These were sold to the New Orleans market.  Wealthy planters utilized slave labor on their plantations, and by 1860, there were over 7,000 slaves in the parish.\n\nA [[yellow fever]] epidemic in 1855, followed by a deadly fire and a destructive hurricane, ended an era of unbridled prosperity.  These events, combined with the effects of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] took a heavy toll on the parish.  However, the people proved resilient, and in short order became prosperous again.  Corn, cotton, and sugar cane ruled once more, and trees from the swamps were profitably sold.\n\n==Geography==\nThe parish is split into two non-contiguous parts because of a surveying error dating to 1868, when [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was created by the [[Louisiana Legislature]]. [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] divides St. Martin Parish into two separate areas, Upper and Lower St. Martin.  According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|816|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|738|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|79|sqmi}} (9.7%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>  St. Martin Parish is in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]], with [[Bayou Teche]] running through it.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 52,160.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/22099.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref> The [[parish seat]] is [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The parish was founded in 1811.\n\nSt. Martin Parish is part of the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] [[Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. 27% of the population of St. Martin Parish have [[French language|French]] fluency, rated as one of the highest concentrations of French speakers in the nation.\n\n==History==\nIn 1811, the division of [[Attakapas County, Orleans Territory|Attakapas Parish]] created St. Martin Parish and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]].  In 1824, St. Martin Parish was divided, resulting in the creation of [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]].  In 1844, St. Martin Parish was again divided, creating [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana|Vermilion Parish]].  In 1868, [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was formed from parts of St. Martin Parish and St. Mary Parish, literally dividing St. Martin Parish in two, as part of Iberia Parish runs between the two non-contiguous parts of St. Martin Parish.\n\nSt. Martin Parish was largely colonized by people from France and [[Acadia]] in the 1700s, accounting for the large concentration of French-speaking population today.  The Acadians brought with them the tale of Evangeline, a young woman who was separated from her supposedly-mortally-wounded betrothed during the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]]. According to the tale, Evangeline later met her betrothed in St. Martin Parish, but he had moved on to a new love and she never recovered from the shock of both finding him and losing him again.  [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s most famous work, [[Evangeline|'''''Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie''''']], was based on this story.  Evangeline was and remains an icon of Acadian and American culture.  The historical Evangeline, who is believed by some to have been an orphan girl named Emmeline Labiche, is supposed to have been buried on the grounds of the St. Martin de Tours Catholic Church in St. Martinville.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/southwestlouisia00perr|title=Southwest Louisiana, biographical and historical|last=Perrin|first=William Henry|date=1891|publisher=New Orleans : Gulf Publishing Co.|others=The Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nSt. Martin was a very prosperous parish, growing rapidly in the early 1800s.  Most of the money at that time was being made by raising cattle.  Other profitable crops were cotton, sugar, corn, rice and tobacco.  These were sold to the New Orleans market.  Wealthy planters utilized slave labor on their plantations, and by 1860, there were over 7,000 slaves in the parish.\n\nA [[yellow fever]] epidemic in 1855, followed by a deadly fire and a destructive hurricane, ended an era of unbridled prosperity.  These events, combined with the effects of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] took a heavy toll on the parish.  However, the people proved resilient, and in short order became prosperous again.  Corn, cotton, and sugar cane ruled once more, and trees from the swamps were profitably sold.\n\n==Geography==\nThe parish is split into two non-contiguous parts because of a surveying error dating to 1868, when [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] was created by the [[Louisiana Legislature]]. [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia Parish]] divides St. Martin Parish into two separate areas, Upper and Lower St. Martin.  According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the parish has a total area of {{convert|816|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|738|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|79|sqmi}} (9.7%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928155956/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_22.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>  St. Martin Parish is in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]], with [[Bayou Teche]] running through it.

Catholics number about 83,214 (2006 census). Parishes number 22 and the archdiocese extends over central New Zealand between Levin and Masterton in the north to Kaikoura to Westport in the south.<ref>[http://www.wn.catholic.org.nz/ Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington website] (retrieved 15 March 2011)</ref>\n\nThe suffragan sees are:\n\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Auckland]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin|Dunedin]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton in New Zealand|Hamilton in New Zealand]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Palmerston North]]\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Catholic Church in New Zealand}}\n\n===Pioneers===\nThe Catholic faith of the new immigrants to Wellington was initially sustained through the efforts of Dr John Fitzgerald who arrived on 31 January 1840. He led the Sunday prayers and organised [[Christian Doctrine]] classes. The first resident priest was the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Father Jeremiah O\u2019Riley who arrived as chaplain to [[Henry William Petre|Hon Henry William Petre]], a director of the [[New Zealand Company]] and one of the founders of Wellington. O\u2019Riley arrived in January 1843 and within a year the first, small Catholic church was built and dedicated to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]. Meanwhile, the Auckland-based French [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] ministered extensively throughout the country and Fr J.B. Compte SM established a permanent mission at [[Otaki, New Zealand|Otaki]] in 1844.<ref name=\"History\">\"History of the Archdiocese of Wellington\", Archdiocese of Wellington, 2006(?), pp. 1 and 2.</ref>\n\n===Marists===\nIn June 1848, [[Pope Pius IX]] divided New Zealand into two dioceses, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Auckland]] and Wellington which consisting of the lower half of the [[North Island]] and the whole of the [[South Island]]. [[Philippe Viard|Bishop Philippe Viard]], who arrived in Wellington on the barque \u201cClara\u201d on 1 May 1850, was the first Bishop. With him were five Marist priests, ten lay brothers, two lay male teachers, three M\u0101ori and four young women, the \u201cSisters of Mary\u201d who commenced teaching at what became [[St Mary's College, Wellington|St Mary's College]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral School, Thorndon|Sacred Heart Cathedral School]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Establishment===\nViard bought and was given land in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] on which his residence, St Mary's Convent and [[St Mary's Cathedral, Wellington|St Mary's Cathedral]]  were built. Fr Garin and Br Clause went to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] to establish the church there. Fr Lampila and two others established a mission in [[Hawkes Bay]]. Fr Forest and Mr Huntley worked in the [[Hutt Valley]]. Fathers Petitjean and Seon travelled extensively throughout the [[South Island]]. By 1852 a parish had been established in [[Whanganui]] and the M\u0101ori mission on the [[Whanganui River]] had a resident priest. For ten years, however, Viard received no reinforcements and illness took a toll on his personnel. In March 1860 the Sisters of Mercy arrived from Auckland to take over the works of the four Sisters of Mary.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1859 three more Marist priests arrived and pastors could be provided to [[New Plymouth]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]. The discovery of gold in 1857 and after meant a rapid expansion of the Church on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin|Dunedin]] became a separate diocese in 1869. Irish priests arrived and followed their compatriots to the [[gold mine|diggings]]. The [[Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions|Sisters of the Missions]] also arrived to establish schools in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] ([[Sacred Heart College (Napier)|Sacred Heart College Napier]] and [[St Joseph's M\u0101ori Girls' College]]) and in [[Christchurch]] and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Archdiocese===\nBishop Viard died on 2 June 1872 and was succeeded by [[Francis Redwood|Bishop Francis Redwood SM]], who remained ordinary of the Diocese for 61 years. The Diocese was raised to an Archdiocese on 10 May 1887 and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]] became a separate diocese. [[Thomas O'Shea (Archbishop of Wellington)|Thomas O\u2019Shea SM]] became his [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor Archbishop]] in 1913 and remained so for 22 years. Redwood died in 1935 and was succeeded by O\u2019Shea whose [[Bishop|archepiscopate]] lasted for 12 years. [[Peter McKeefry]] was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop in 1947 and succeeded on the death of O\u2019Shea in 1954. McKeefry was appointed a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1969 and was assisted by [[Owen Snedden|Bishop Owen Snedden]] who was [[auxiliary bishop]] from 1962.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Cardinals===\nDuring McKeefry's episcopate the Catholic population of Wellington more than doubled and 39 new parishes were established. New [[religious institute (Catholic)|orders]] arrived such as the [[Southern Star Abbey|Cistercians in Hawkes Bay]].  McKeefry, who became New Zealand's first cardinal in 1969, was succeeded in 1973 by [[Reginald Delargey|Cardinal Reginald Delargey]] who in turn was succeeded, on his death in 1979, by [[Thomas Williams (Archbishop of Wellington)|Archbishop Thomas Williams]], who became a cardinal in 1983. In 1980 the archdiocese was split with the creation of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Palmerston North Diocese]]. Williams retired in March 2005 and [[John Dew (Archbishop)|Archbishop John Dew]] was appointed as his replacement. He was appointed a cardinal in 2015.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Retrenchment===\nIn 2019 Cardinal Dew, addressing the state of the church's buildings and the future of their congregations, stated that soaring insurance costs and a dwindling number of priests meant that the resources of the archdiocese would have to be more efficiently used. He said that fewer resources would be poured into retaining buildings and more attention and energy focused on serving the poor, as required by [[Pope Francis]] and the [[Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod]]. He said that earthquake resilience issues meant that the archdiocese was liable for unsustainable insurance costs and the strengthening of buildings with unacceptable New Building Standard ratings. Already four churches and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] had been closed because of this. He also stated that some parishes would need to amalgamate to cope with the lack of clergy. He said that the reduced number of priests, which was accelerating each year, meant that in most parishes there was a single priest \u2013 often elderly \u2013 expected to minister in more than one church. Availability and ability of priests were highly significant factors governing decisions for the future that could not be delayed. Between 2013 and 2017 the archdiocese carried out a parish amalgamation process, which led to the reduction in parishes from 47 to 22, and many of the new parishes had too many churches, presbyteries, and other buildings.<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/111692890/cardinal-john-dew-calls-for-overhaul-of-catholic-church-in-wellington-archdiocese Tommy Livingston, \"Cardinal John Dew calls for overhaul of Catholic Church in Wellington Archdiocese\", ''Stuff News'', 1 April 2019] (Retrieved 02 April 2019)</ref>\n\n==Ordinaries==\nPhilippe Viard was [[vicar apostolic]] of the Diocese of Wellington from 1848 until 1860 when he became the Bishop of Wellington.

Parishes number 22 and the archdiocese extends over central New Zealand between Levin and Masterton in the north to Kaikoura to Westport in the south.<ref>[http://www.wn.catholic.org.nz/ Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington website] (retrieved 15 March 2011)</ref>\n\nThe suffragan sees are:\n\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Auckland]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin|Dunedin]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton in New Zealand|Hamilton in New Zealand]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Palmerston North]]\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Catholic Church in New Zealand}}\n\n===Pioneers===\nThe Catholic faith of the new immigrants to Wellington was initially sustained through the efforts of Dr John Fitzgerald who arrived on 31 January 1840. He led the Sunday prayers and organised [[Christian Doctrine]] classes. The first resident priest was the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] Father Jeremiah O\u2019Riley who arrived as chaplain to [[Henry William Petre|Hon Henry William Petre]], a director of the [[New Zealand Company]] and one of the founders of Wellington. O\u2019Riley arrived in January 1843 and within a year the first, small Catholic church was built and dedicated to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]. Meanwhile, the Auckland-based French [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] ministered extensively throughout the country and Fr J.B. Compte SM established a permanent mission at [[Otaki, New Zealand|Otaki]] in 1844.<ref name=\"History\">\"History of the Archdiocese of Wellington\", Archdiocese of Wellington, 2006(?), pp. 1 and 2.</ref>\n\n===Marists===\nIn June 1848, [[Pope Pius IX]] divided New Zealand into two dioceses, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Auckland|Auckland]] and Wellington, consisting of the lower half of the [[North Island]] and the whole of the [[South Island]]. [[Philippe Viard|Bishop Philippe Viard]], who arrived in Wellington on the barque \u201cClara\u201d on 1 May 1850, was the first Bishop. With him were five Marist priests, ten lay brothers, two lay male teachers, three M\u0101ori and four young women, the \u201cSisters of Mary\u201d who commenced teaching at what became [[St Mary's College, Wellington|St Mary's College]] and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral School, Thorndon|Sacred Heart Cathedral School]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Establishment===\nViard bought and was given land in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]] on which his residence, St Mary's Convent and [[St Mary's Cathedral, Wellington|St Mary's Cathedral]]  were built. Fr Garin and Br Clause went to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] to establish the church there. Fr Lampila and two others established a mission in [[Hawkes Bay]]. Fr Forest and Mr Huntley worked in the [[Hutt Valley]]. Fathers Petitjean and Seon travelled extensively throughout the [[South Island]]. By 1852 a parish had been established in [[Whanganui]] and the M\u0101ori mission on the [[Whanganui River]] had a resident priest. For ten years, however, Viard received no reinforcements and illness took a toll on his personnel. In March 1860 the Sisters of Mercy arrived from Auckland to take over the works of the four Sisters of Mary.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1859 three more Marist priests arrived and pastors could be provided to [[New Plymouth]], [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]]. The discovery of gold in 1857 and after meant a rapid expansion of the Church on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunedin|Dunedin]] which became a separate diocese in 1869. Irish priests arrived and followed their compatriots and their families to the [[gold mine|diggings]]. The [[Congregation of Our Lady of the Missions|Sisters of the Missions]] also arrived to establish schools in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] ([[Sacred Heart College (Napier)]] and [[St Joseph's M\u0101ori Girls' College]]) and in [[Christchurch]] and [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Archdiocese===\nBishop Viard died on 2 June 1872 and was succeeded by [[Francis Redwood|Bishop Francis Redwood SM]] who was to remain ordinary of the Diocese for 61 years. The Diocese was raised to an Archdiocese on 10 May 1887 and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]] became a separate diocese. [[Thomas O'Shea (Archbishop of Wellington)|Thomas O\u2019Shea SM]] became his [[Coadjutor bishop|Coadjutor Archbishop]] in 1913 and remained so for 22 years. Redwood died in 1935 and was succeeded by O\u2019Shea whose [[Bishop|archepiscopate]] lasted for 12 years. [[Peter McKeefry]] was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop in 1947 and succeeded on the death of O\u2019Shea in 1954. McKeefry was appointed as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] in 1969 and was assisted by [[Owen Snedden|Bishop Owen Snedden]] who was [[auxiliary bishop]] from 1962.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Cardinals===\nDuring McKeefry's episcopate the Catholic population of Wellington more than doubled and 39 new parishes were established. New [[religious institute (Catholic)|orders]] arrived such as the [[Southern Star Abbey|Cistercians in Hawkes Bay]].  McKeefry, who became New Zealand's first cardinal in 1967, was succeeded in 1973 by [[Reginald Delargey|Cardinal Reginald Delargey]] and he in turn was succeeded, on his death in 1979, by [[Thomas Williams (Archbishop of Wellington)|Archbishop Thomas Williams]] who was made a cardinal in 1983. In 1980 the Archdiocese was split with the creation of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palmerston North|Palmerston North Diocese]]. Williams retired in March 2005 and [[John Dew (Archbishop)|Archbishop John Dew]] was appointed as his replacement. He was appointed as a cardinal in 2015.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Retrenchment===\nIn 2019, Cardinal Dew, addressing the state of the church's buildings and the future of their congregations, stated that soaring insurance costs and a dwindling number of priests meant that the resources of the archdiocese would have to be more efficiently used. He said that fewer resources would be poured into retaining buildings, and more attention and energy would be focused on serving the poor, as required by [[Pope Francis]] and the [[Fifteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod]]. He said that earthquake resilience issues meant that the archdiocese was liable for unsustainable insurance costs and the strengthening of buildings with unacceptable New Building Standard ratings. Already four churches and [[Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] had been closed because of this. He also stated that some parishes would need to amalgamate to cope with the lack of clergy. He said that the reduced number of priests, which was accelerating each year, meant that in most parishes there was a single priest - often elderly - expected to minister in more than one church. Availability and ability of priests were highly significant factors governing decisions for the future that could not be delayed. Between 2013 and 2017 the Archdiocese had carried out a parish amalgamation process, which led to the reduction in parishes from 47 to 22 and many of the new parishes had too many churches, presbyteries and other buildings.<ref>[https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/111692890/cardinal-john-dew-calls-for-overhaul-of-catholic-church-in-wellington-archdiocese Tommy Livingston, \"Cardinal John Dew calls for overhaul of Catholic Church in Wellington Archdiocese\", ''Stuff News'', 1 April 2019] (Retrieved 02 April 2019)</ref>\n\n==Ordinaries==\nPhilippe Viard was [[vicar apostolic]] of the Diocese of Wellington from 1848 until 1860 when he became the Bishop of Wellington.
