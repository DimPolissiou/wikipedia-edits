It was founded by [[Steve Chen]], [[Chad Hurley]] and [[Jawed Karim]] in February 2005, and the first video was \"[[Me at the zoo]]\" uploaded by Karim on his channel in April 2005. Although the most-viewed videos were initially [[viral video]]s, such as \"[[Judson Laipply#\"Evolution of Dance\"|Evolution of Dance]]\" and \"[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]\", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to [[music videos]]. In fact, since [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[Bad Romance]]\", every video that has reached the top of the \"most-viewed YouTube videos\" list has been a music video. Although some of the previously most-viewed videos are no longer listed on the site, reaching the top of the list is still considered a tremendous feat.\n\nIn November 2005, a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertisement featuring Brazilian football player [[Ronaldinho]] became the first video to reach one million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/31/2005-nike-video-featuring-ronaldinho-becomes-first-youtube-film-reach-one-million|title=2005: Nike video featuring Ronaldinho becomes first YouTube film to reach one million views}}</ref>\n\n==Billion View Club==\nAn early metric of a video's popularity was the so-called Billion View Club, videos which had succeeded in reaching over 1 billion views since their initial upload.<ref name=\"RollingStone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-billion-view-club-youtubes-most-watched-music-videos-162074/|title=The Billion View Club: YouTube's Most Watched Music Videos|first=Brittany|last=Spanos|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2012, \"[[Gangnam Style (music video)|Gangnam Style]]\" became the first video to reach one billion views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/1481275/psys-gangnam-style-hits-1-billion-views-on-youtube|title=PSY's 'Gangnam Style' Hits 1 Billion Views on YouTube}}</ref> By June 2015, only \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)#Music video|Baby]]\" had managed to pass this threshold; but, by October 2015, a total of ten videos had done so,<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> and the number grew further to 100 in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/02/21/there-are-now-over-100-youtube-videos-with-at-least-a-billion-views/#1758c6056415|title=There Are Now Over 100 YouTube Videos With At Least A Billion Views}}</ref> Considering older videos that pre-dated YouTube's creation in 2005 but were added later:\n* \"[[November Rain]]\" by [[Guns N' Roses]] became the first video made prior to YouTube's creation to reach this threshold by July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/guns-n-roses-november-rain-first-90s-video-1-billion-views-youtube/|title=Guns N' Roses' 'November Rain' Is First '90s Video to Top 1 Billion YouTube Views|first=Michael|last=Christopher|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Loudwire]]}}</ref>\n* \"[[Numb (Linkin Park song)|Numb]]\" by [[Linkin Park]] was the first 2000s video predating YouTube to reach 1 billion views in November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/linkin-parks-numb-video-has-reached-1-billion-views-on-youtube|title=Linkin Park's 'Numb' video has reached 1 billion views on YouTube}}</ref>\n* \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was the first 1970s video (and pre-1990s video) to reach 1 billion views in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/22/bohemian-rhapsody-becomes-first-pre-1990s-song-rack-billion/|title=Bohemian Rhapsody becomes first pre-1990s song to rack up billion hits on YouTube, site announces|first=Jessica|last=Carpani|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n* Guns N' Roses' \"[[Sweet Child o' Mine]]\" was the first 1980s video to reach 1 billion views in October 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/guns-n-roses-sweet-child-o-mine-1-billion-views-1203371701/|title=Guns N' Roses' 'Sweet Child O' Mine' Becomes First '80s Music Video's to Hit 1 Billion YouTube Views|first=Breanna|last=Bell|date=October 15, 2019|accessdate=October 15, 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nWith numerous videos readily clearing one billion views by 2018, more interest has been on two and three-billion views and higher metrics.

(called '''''Where's Waldo?''''' in [[North America]]) is a British series of children's puzzle books created by English illustrator [[Martin Handford]]. The books consist of a series of detailed double-page spread illustrations depicting dozens or more people doing a variety of amusing things at a given location. Readers are challenged to find a character named Wally hidden in the group.\n\nWally is identified by his red-and-white-striped shirt, [[bobble hat]], and glasses, but many illustrations contain [[red herring]]s involving deceptive use of red-and-white striped objects. Later entries in the long-running book series added other targets for readers to find in each illustration.<ref>{{cite news|title= Wally's World |work=LA Times|date=26 November 1997|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/news/ls-57728|accessdate=23 August 2010|first=Jodi|last=Duckett}}</ref> The books have also inspired two television programmes (''[[Where's Wally? (TV series)|Where's Wally?]]'' the 1991 animated series and ''[[Where's Waldo? (2019 TV series)|Where's Wally?]]'' the 2019 animated series), a comic strip and a series of video games.\n\n==History==\nIn 1986,Handford  was asked by his art director at Walker Books to draw a character with peculiar features so that his pictures of crowds had a focal point. After much thinking, he came up with the idea of \"Wally\", a world traveller and time travel aficionado who always dresses in red and white.<ref name=EW>[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318859_2,00.html \"Up Against the Waldo\"], by Cyndi Stivers, 14 December 1990, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved 8 Feb 2010.</ref>  Sometimes it would take him up to eight weeks to draw a two-page sketch of the elusive \"Wally\" and the characters surrounding him.<ref name=Scholastic>[http://clubs-kids.scholastic.co.uk/clubs_content/2168 \"Interview with Martin Handford\"], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] Book Club. Retrieved 7 Feb 2010.</ref>\n\nThe first ''Where's Wally?'' book was published on 21 September 1987.<ref name=Walkers_books>[http://www.walker.co.uk/whereswally]''[[Walker Books]]''. Retrieved  September 20, 2012.</ref> The ''Where's Wally?'' books were published in the United Kingdom by [[Walker Books]] and in the United States under the title ''Where's Waldo?'' first by [[Little, Brown and Company]] before being taken on by [[Candlewick Press]] (Walker Books' American subsidiary publishing company). The first four titles were originally printed in Italy, but later reprinted in China.\n\nThe books became extremely popular and were localised for many different territories, with name changes for Wally in certain regions. The franchise also spawned other media in a more storyline-based form, including [[Where's Wally? (TV series)|a 1991 television series]], [[Where's Waldo? (comic strip)|a comic strip]] and a series of video games.\n\nAs the series goes on, Wally progressively becomes harder to find, reducing his size on the page and surrounding him by more characters. In the first book, Wally was on average {{convert|0.99|cm2|sqin|abbr=off}} big. This was reduced to {{convert|0.80|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} in the second book, {{convert|0.33|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} in the third, and between {{convert|0.20|and|0.17|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} in the fourth through seventh book. He has also been surrounded by more other characters, from 225 on the first book's first page to about 850 on the last book's first page.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blatt|first1=Ben|title=Where's Waldo's Elusive Hero Didn't Just Get Sneakier. He Got Smaller.|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/03/07/where_s_waldo_didn_t_just_get_harder_to_find_he_got_80_percent_smaller.html|work=Slate|date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Wally''', whose [[Where's Wally?#International editions|name was localised]] for certain international editions, for example '''Waldo''' in North American editions. In the first two books, Wally wandered alone and was the only person to be found in every illustration. Over time, more characters were added to find in each scene.\n* '''Wilma''', Wally's friend first appeared in the ''Ultimate Fun Book'', and was replaced by her identical twin sister Wenda in the ''Where's Wally: The Magnificent Poster Book''.\n* '''Wenda''', A friend of Wally who replaced her twin sister Wilma for ''In Hollywood'' (although she previously appeared in ''The Magnificent Poster Book'').\n* '''Odlaw''', Wally's nemesis, who made his print debut in ''The Magnificent Poster Book''. He appears nearly the same as Wally, except that his clothes are yellow and black striped instead of red and white; his glasses have a blue tint to them; and he has a moustache. He also has a British accent in the [[Where's Waldo? (TV series)|television series]]. Although we are told \"his bad deeds are many\", he is not depicted in the books doing anything particularly nasty. However, in the television series, he is frequently seen to be attempting to steal Wally's magical walking stick. His name \"Odlaw\" is simply a reversal of the spelling of \"Waldo\", the American name for Wally, although he is called \"Odlaw\" in the United Kingdom as well.\n* '''Woof''', Wally's dog, first appeared in ''The Ultimate Fun Book'', where he was identified as Wenda's dog. Only his tail can be found, with the exception of the final page of ''Where's Wally: The Wonder Book'', which depicts all of Woof, and the six activity books released between 1993 and 1995 (the first book of which is titled ''The Truly Terrific Activity Book''), where Woof shows himself to the reader.\n* '''Wizard Whitebeard''', first seen in ''The Fantastic Journey''. His signature is his exceptionally long beard, which is often the key to finding him. In his first appearance, he was responsible for sending Wally on a quest to discover the truth about himself, and he has tagged along on Wally's travels ever since. His appearance in ''The Ultimate Fun Book'', however, is in just one scene (\"Old Friends\") and his presence is unmentioned in the book and acts as one of the background characters.\n* '''The Wally Watchers''' are Wally's devoted fan-club that first appeared in ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book|Where's Wally? The Ultimate Fun Book]]'' (1990). They turn up wherever Wally goes, dressed in the same red-and-white striped outfit. 25 appear in most books, though there are 99 of them in the ''Ultimate Fun Book''.\n* In the earlier books, a character appears in every scene, which the reader must look to find out who it is. This is because no information on the characters is given in the books aside from the task to look for them. The characters appeared as background characters and all had something unique to them (like blonde hair or a ginger beard).\n* In some cases, characters from previous scenes would also appear.\n\n==International editions==\nIn international editions, Wally has often been given a name in the local language:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]: {{lang|af|Willie}}\n* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|\u0641\u0636\u0648\u0644\u064a}} (''Fu\u1e0d\u016bl\u012b'')\n* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: {{lang|bg|\u0423\u043e\u043b\u0438}} (''Uoli'')\n* [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: {{lang|ca|Wally}}\n* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|\u5a01\u5229}}\n** [[Cantonese Chinese|Cantonese]] pronunciation: ''[[Jyutping|Wai<sup>1</sup> lei<sup>6</sup>]]''\n** [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] pronunciation: ''[[Pinyin|W\u0113il\u00ec]]''\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: {{lang|hr|Jura}}\n* [[Czech language|Czech]]: {{lang|cs|Vald\u00edk}}\n* [[Danish language|Danish]]: {{lang|da|Holger}}\n* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: {{lang|nl|Wally}}\n* [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: {{lang|et|Volli}}\n* [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: {{lang|fi|Vallu}}\n* [[French language|French]]: {{lang|fr|Charlie}}\n* [[Galician language|Galician]]: {{lang|gl|Wally}}\n* [[German language|German]]: {{lang|de|Walter}}\n* [[Georgian Language|Georgian]]: {{lang|ka|\u10d5\u10dd\u10da\u10d8}} (''Voli'')\n* [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el|\u0393\u03bf\u03c5\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9}} (''Gou\u03ccli'')\n* [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9}} (''Efi'')\n* [[Hindi language|Hindi]]: {{lang|hi|\u0939\u0947\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0940}} (''He\u1e6d\u1e6di'')\n* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: {{lang|hu|Vili}}\n* [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: {{lang|is|Valli}}\n* [[Italian language|Italian]]: {{lang|it|Ubaldo}}, {{lang|it|Wally}}\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc}} (''[[Hepburn Romanization|W\u014dr\u012b]]'')\n* [[Korean language|Korean]]: {{lang|ko|\uc6d4\ub9ac}} (''[[Revised Romanization of Korean|Walli]]'')\n* [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: {{lang|lt|Valdas}}\n* [[North American English]]: {{lang|en|Waldo}}\n* [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: {{lang|no|Willy}}\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]: {{lang|pl|Wally}}\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: {{lang|pt|Wally}}\n* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: {{lang|ro|Wally}}\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|\u0423\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438}} (''Uolli'')\n* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: {{lang|sr|\u0413\u0438\u043b\u0435}} (''Gile'')\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: {{lang|es|Wally}}\n* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: {{lang|sv|Waldo}}, {{lang|sv|Valle}}, {{lang|sv|Hugo}}\n* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: {{lang|tr|Ali}}, {{lang|tr|Gezgin Veli}}\n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: {{lang|cy|Wali}}\n{{div col end}}\n\nSome examples of the full book names in other countries include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* ''Waar's Willie?''

The books were released both in hard-cover (for the original books) and subsequently in paperback. Each contains around a dozen scenes with Wally hidden in them. Each book has additional hidden objects and/or characters hidden in each scene specific to that book. The books usually reserve telling the reader about some item(s) to find until the end of the book so that the reader will have to go through the book again. The books contain checklists for each scene of interesting things or people to find.\n\n# ''[[Where's Wally? (book)|Where's Wally?]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo?'') (1987)\n# ''[[Where's Wally Now?]]'' (US title: ''Find Waldo Now'', renamed ''Where's Waldo Now?'' later) (1988)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Fantastic Journey]]'' (US title: ''The Great Waldo Search'') (1989)\n# ''[[Where's Wally in Hollywood?]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo in Hollywood?'') (1993)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Wonder Book]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo? The Wonder Book'') (1997)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Great Picture Hunt!]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo? The Great Picture Hunt!'') (2006)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Incredible Paper Chase]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo? The Incredible Paper Chase'') (2009)\n\nThere have been three rounds of revised editions. In 1993, to coincide with the publication of ''In Hollywood'', the first three books were reprinted with Wenda, Woof and the Wally Watchers added to the original illustrations, and the books were numbered on the cover. A \"pocket edition\" of the first book was also published, in a tiny [[ISO 216|A6]] format ({{convert|105|\u00d7|148|mm|in|disp=comma}}). Wally is even harder to spot when shrunk to this degree, and later printings included a free magnifying lens.\n\nIn 1997, to coincide with the publication of ''The Wonder Book'', special \"Tenth Anniversary Editions\" of the first four books were published with a distinct silver border on their front covers, and added later-introduced characters and objects to look for in every scene, and also moved Wally to different locations from the original versions. These special editions appeared in both standard and \"pocket\" formats.\n\nIn 2007, for the 20th anniversary of the first book, the special editions of 1997 (and ''The Great Picture Hunt'') were re-released with a new cover into paperback format. The silver borders on the books were removed and instead, the books were numbered in the top left-hand corner of the cover. Aside from the new numbering system, some of the front covers were also revised otherwise; for example, the \"NOW?\" on the cover of ''Where's Wally Now?'' was given a 2D effect, but it was originally designed to look like a 3D shape.\n\n====Other books====\nIn addition to the primary books, other books have also been published in the Wally franchise. The first alternate-format Wally book was the ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book|Ultimate Fun Book]]''. In addition to standard Wally scenes, this paperback activity book featured other types of games and activities, as well as cardboard punch-outs and stickers. ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Magnificent Poster Book!|The Magnificent Poster Book]]'', which was a large-format book of posters including five scenes from past books and six new scenes (later included in ''The Great Picture Hunt'').\n* ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book|Where's Wally?

(called '''''Where's Waldo?''''' in [[North America]]) is a British series of children's puzzle books created by English illustrator [[Martin Handford]]. The books consist of a series of detailed double-page spread illustrations depicting dozens or more people doing a variety of amusing things at a given location. Readers are challenged to find a character named Wally hidden in the group.\n\nWally is identified by his red-and-white-striped shirt, [[bobble hat]], and glasses, but many illustrations contain [[red herring]]s involving deceptive use of red-and-white striped objects. Later entries in the long-running book series added other targets for readers to find in each illustration.<ref>{{cite news|title= Wally's World |work=LA Times|date=26 November 1997|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/news/ls-57728|accessdate=23 August 2010|first=Jodi|last=Duckett}}</ref> The books have also inspired two television programmes (''[[Where's Wally? (TV series)|Where's Wally?]]'' the 1991 animated series and ''[[Where's Waldo? (2019 TV series)|Where's Wally?]]'' the 2019 animated series), a comic strip and a series of video games.\n\n==History==\nIn 1986,  Handford  was asked by his art director at Walker Books to draw a character with peculiar features so that his pictures of crowds had a focal point. After much thinking, he came up with the idea of \"Wally\", a world traveller and time travel aficionado who always dresses in red and white.<ref name=EW>[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318859_2,00.html \"Up Against the Waldo\"], by Cyndi Stivers, 14 December 1990, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

Retrieved  September 20, 2012.</ref> The ''Where's Wally?'' books were published in the United Kingdom by [[Walker Books]] and in the United States under the title ''Where's Waldo?'' first by [[Little, Brown and Company]] before being taken on by [[Candlewick Press]] (Walker Books' American subsidiary publishing company). The first four titles were originally printed in Italy, but later reprinted in China.\n\nThe books became extremely popular and were localised for many different territories, with name changes for Wally in certain regions. The franchise also spawned other media in a more storyline-based form, including [[Where's Wally? (TV series)|a 1991 television series]], [[Where's Waldo? (comic strip)|a comic strip]] and a series of video games.\n\nAs the series goes on, Wally progressively becomes harder to find, reducing his size on the page and surrounding him by more characters. In the first book, Wally was on average {{convert|0.99|cm2|sqin|abbr=off}} big. This was reduced to {{convert|0.80|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} in the second book, {{convert|0.33|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} in the third, and between {{convert|0.20|and|0.17|cm2|sqin|abbr=on}} in the fourth through seventh book. He has also been surrounded by more other characters, from 225 on the first book's first page to about 850 on the last book's first page.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blatt|first1=Ben|title=Where's Waldo's Elusive Hero Didn't Just Get Sneakier.

In the first two books, Wally wandered alone and was the only person to be found in every illustration. Over time, more characters were added to find in each scene.\n* '''Wilma''', Wally's friend first appeared in the ''Ultimate Fun Book'', and was replaced by her identical twin sister Wenda in the ''Where's Wally: The Magnificent Poster Book''.\n* '''Wenda''', A friend of Wally who replaced her twin sister Wilma for ''In Hollywood'' (although she previously appeared in ''The Magnificent Poster Book'').\n* '''Odlaw''', Wally's nemesis, who made his print debut in ''The Magnificent Poster Book''. He appears nearly the same as Wally, except that his clothes are yellow and black striped instead of red and white; his glasses have a blue tint to them; and he has a moustache. He also has a British accent in the [[Where's Waldo? (TV series)|television series]]. Although we are told \"his bad deeds are many\", he is not depicted in the books doing anything particularly nasty. However, in the television series, he is frequently seen to be attempting to steal Wally's magical walking stick. His name \"Odlaw\" is simply a reversal of the spelling of \"Waldo\", the American name for Wally, although he is called \"Odlaw\" in the United Kingdom as well.\n* '''Woof''', Wally's dog, first appeared in ''The Ultimate Fun Book'', where he was identified as Wenda's dog. Only his tail can be found, with the exception of the final page of ''Where's Wally: The Wonder Book'', which depicts all of Woof, and the six activity books released between 1993 and 1995 (the first book of which is titled ''The Truly Terrific Activity Book''), where Woof shows himself to the reader.\n* '''Wizard Whitebeard''', first seen in ''The Fantastic Journey''. His signature is his exceptionally long beard, which is often the key to finding him. In his first appearance, he was responsible for sending Wally on a quest to discover the truth about himself, and he has tagged along on Wally's travels ever since. His appearance in ''The Ultimate Fun Book'', however, is in just one scene (\"Old Friends\") and his presence is unmentioned in the book and acts as one of the background characters.\n* '''The Wally Watchers''' are Wally's devoted fan-club that first appeared in ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book|Where's Wally? The Ultimate Fun Book]]'' (1990). They turn up wherever Wally goes, dressed in the same red-and-white striped outfit. 25 appear in most books, though there are 99 of them in the ''Ultimate Fun Book''.\n* In the earlier books, a character appears in every scene, which the reader must look to find out who it is. This is because no information on the characters is given in the books aside from the task to look for them. The characters appeared as background characters and all had something unique to them (like blonde hair or a ginger beard).\n* In some cases, characters from previous scenes would also appear.\n\n==International editions==\nIn international editions, Wally has often been given a name in the local language:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]: {{lang|af|Willie}}\n* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|\u0641\u0636\u0648\u0644\u064a}} (''Fu\u1e0d\u016bl\u012b'')\n* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: {{lang|bg|\u0423\u043e\u043b\u0438}} (''Uoli'')\n* [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: {{lang|ca|Wally}}\n* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|\u5a01\u5229}}\n** [[Cantonese Chinese|Cantonese]] pronunciation: ''[[Jyutping|Wai<sup>1</sup> lei<sup>6</sup>]]''\n** [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] pronunciation: ''[[Pinyin|W\u0113il\u00ec]]''\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: {{lang|hr|Jura}}\n* [[Czech language|Czech]]: {{lang|cs|Vald\u00edk}}\n* [[Danish language|Danish]]: {{lang|da|Holger}}\n* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: {{lang|nl|Wally}}\n* [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: {{lang|et|Volli}}\n* [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: {{lang|fi|Vallu}}\n* [[French language|French]]: {{lang|fr|Charlie}}\n* [[Galician language|Galician]]: {{lang|gl|Wally}}\n* [[German language|German]]: {{lang|de|Walter}}\n* [[Georgian Language|Georgian]]: {{lang|ka|\u10d5\u10dd\u10da\u10d8}} (''Voli'')\n* [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el|\u0393\u03bf\u03c5\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9}} (''Gou\u03ccli'')\n* [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9}} (''Efi'')\n* [[Hindi language|Hindi]]: {{lang|hi|\u0939\u0947\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0940}} (''He\u1e6d\u1e6di'')\n* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: {{lang|hu|Vili}}\n* [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: {{lang|is|Valli}}\n* [[Italian language|Italian]]: {{lang|it|Ubaldo}}, {{lang|it|Wally}}\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc}} (''[[Hepburn Romanization|W\u014dr\u012b]]'')\n* [[Korean language|Korean]]: {{lang|ko|\uc6d4\ub9ac}} (''[[Revised Romanization of Korean|Walli]]'')\n* [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: {{lang|lt|Valdas}}\n* [[North American English]]: {{lang|en|Waldo}}\n* [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: {{lang|no|Willy}}\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]: {{lang|pl|Wally}}\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: {{lang|pt|Wally}}\n* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: {{lang|ro|Wally}}\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|\u0423\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0438}} (''Uolli'')\n* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: {{lang|sr|\u0413\u0438\u043b\u0435}} (''Gile'')\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: {{lang|es|Wally}}\n* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: {{lang|sv|Waldo}}, {{lang|sv|Valle}}, {{lang|sv|Hugo}}\n* [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: {{lang|tr|Ali}}, {{lang|tr|Gezgin Veli}}\n* [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: {{lang|cy|Wali}}\n{{div col end}}\n\nSome examples of the full book names in other countries include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* ''Waar's Willie?''

The books were released both in hard-cover (for the original books) and subsequently in paperback. Each contains around a dozen scenes with Wally hidden in them. Each book has additional hidden objects and/or characters hidden in each scene specific to that book. The books usually reserve telling the reader about some item(s) to find until the end of the book so that the reader will have to go through the book again. The books contain checklists for each scene of interesting things or people to find.\n\n# ''[[Where's Wally? (book)|Where's Wally?]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo?'') (1987)\n# ''[[Where's Wally Now?]]'' (US title: ''Find Waldo Now'', renamed ''Where's Waldo Now?'' later) (1988)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Fantastic Journey]]'' (US title: ''The Great Waldo Search'') (1989)\n# ''[[Where's Wally in Hollywood?]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo in Hollywood?'') (1993)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Wonder Book]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo? The Wonder Book'') (1997)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Great Picture Hunt!]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo? The Great Picture Hunt!'') (2006)\n# ''[[Where's Wally? The Incredible Paper Chase]]'' (US title: ''Where's Waldo? The Incredible Paper Chase'') (2009)\n\nThere have been three rounds of revised editions. In 1993, to coincide with the publication of ''In Hollywood'', the first three books were reprinted with Wenda, Woof and the Wally Watchers added to the original illustrations, and the books were numbered on the cover. A \"pocket edition\" of the first book was also published, in a tiny [[ISO 216|A6]] format ({{convert|105|\u00d7|148|mm|in|disp=comma}}). Wally is even harder to spot when shrunk to this degree, and later printings included a free magnifying lens.\n\nIn 1997, to coincide with the publication of ''The Wonder Book'', special \"Tenth Anniversary Editions\" of the first four books were published with a distinct silver border on their front covers, and added later-introduced characters and objects to look for in every scene, and also moved Wally to different locations from the original versions. These special editions appeared in both standard and \"pocket\" formats.\n\nIn 2007, for the 20th anniversary of the first book, the special editions of 1997 (and ''The Great Picture Hunt'') were re-released with a new cover into paperback format. The silver borders on the books were removed and instead, the books were numbered in the top left-hand corner of the cover. Aside from the new numbering system, some of the front covers were also revised otherwise; for example, the \"NOW?\" on the cover of ''Where's Wally Now?'' was given a 2D effect, but it was originally designed to look like a 3D shape.\n\n====Other books====\nIn addition to the primary books, other books have also been published in the Wally franchise. The first alternate-format Wally book was the ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book|Ultimate Fun Book]]''. In addition to standard Wally scenes, this paperback activity book featured other types of games and activities, as well as cardboard punch-outs and stickers. ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Magnificent Poster Book!|The Magnificent Poster Book]]'', which was a large-format book of posters including five scenes from past books and six new scenes (later included in ''The Great Picture Hunt'').\n* ''[[Where's Waldo?: The Ultimate Fun Book|Where's Wally?

It is one of many monuments in Washington, D.C. which honor foreign heroes who symbolize freedom in their native countries.  The memorial honors [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814\u20131861), a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] poet and artist who influenced the development of modern [[Ukrainian literature]].\n\nThe committee to build the memorial included former U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as the honorary head.  Opposition to the memorial's installation was led by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  It was dedicated in 1964, the 150th anniversary of Shevchenko's birth.  Dignitaries at the dedication ceremony included prominent [[Ukrainian American]]s, former U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], members of the U.S. Congress, and [[Hollywood]] actors.\n\nSculpted by [[Leo Mol]], the statue is one of two Ukrainian monuments in the nation's capital. The second, a [[Holodomor Genocide Memorial, Washington, DC|memorial]] to the Ukrainian victims of the [[Holodomor|1932\u20131933 famine]], was completed in 2015.  The Taras Shevchenko Memorial and surrounding park are maintained by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Taras Shevchenko - portrait by Ivan Kramskoi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Taras Shevchenko by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]]]\nIn addition to its numerous memorials and monuments which pay homage to famous Americans, [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to many artworks honoring foreign heroes. Examples in [[Dupont Circle]] include memorials honoring [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] of India, [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] of Czechoslovakia, and [[Lajos Kossuth]] of Hungary.<ref name=slavic>{{cite web | url = https://www.loc.gov/rr/european/slavdc/aaass.html | title = Slavic and Central European Sights of Interest: Washington, DC and Vicinity |last1 = Cannon | first1 = Angela | last2 = Leich | first2 = Harry | date = June 9, 2009 | work = European Reading Room | publisher = The Library of Congress | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=sweet>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/24/AR2005112400771.html | title = Sweet Land of Giving | last = Krauthammer | first = Charles | date = November 25, 2005 | work = The Washington Post | pages = A37 | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/us/30memorial.html | title = A City of Memorials Finds Itself Filling Up | last = Barringer | first = Felicity | date = December 30, 2006 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref>  The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898.  Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal.  A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in ''[[Svoboda (newspaper)|Svoboda]]'' titled \"In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.\", asking for support from the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] and [[Ukrainian Congress Committee of America]] (UCCA).  Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while [[Lev Dobriansky]], a Ukrainian American economist and [[anti-communism]] activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko.<ref name=sydoruk>{{cite news|url=http://ukrainianweek.com/Culture/19194 |title=Shevchenko in Washington |work=The Ukrainian Week |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |author=Sydoruk, Arkadii |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6UPklQQBg?url=http://ukrainianweek.com/Culture/19194 |archivedate=November 28, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=dobriansky>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020503179_pf.html | title = Lev E.

It is one of many monuments in Washington, D.C. which honor foreign heroes who symbolize freedom in their native countries.  The memorial honors [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814\u20131861), a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] poet and artist who influenced the development of modern [[Ukrainian literature]].\n\nThe committee to build the memorial included former U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as the honorary head.  Opposition to the memorial's installation was led by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  It was dedicated in 1964, the 150th anniversary of Shevchenko's birth.  Dignitaries at the dedication ceremony included prominent [[Ukrainian American]]s, former U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], members of the U.S. Congress, and [[Hollywood]] actors.\n\nSculpted by [[Leo Mol]], the statue is one of two Ukrainian monuments in the nation's capital. The second, a [[Holodomor Genocide Memorial, Washington, DC|memorial]] to the Ukrainian victims of the [[Holodomor|1932\u20131933 famine]], was completed in 2015.  The Taras Shevchenko Memorial and surrounding park are maintained by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Taras Shevchenko - portrait by Ivan Kramskoi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Taras Shevchenko by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]]]\nIn addition to its numerous memorials and monuments which pay homage to famous Americans, [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to many artworks honoring foreign heroes.

Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal.  A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in ''[[Svoboda (newspaper)|Svoboda]]'' titled \"In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.\", asking for support from the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] and [[Ukrainian Congress Committee of America]] (UCCA).

This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:\n\nIn [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Extremist Islamic positions \n118. In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Connection to Kharijites ==\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== {{visible anchor|Active Islamic extremist groups|Active_Islamic_Extremist_Groups}} ==\nSome of the proponents of [[Islam]] emphasise peaceful political processes, whereas [[Sayyid Qutb]] in particular called for violence, and those followers are generally considered '''Islamic extremists''' and their stated goal is [[Islamic revolution]] with the intent to force implementation of [[Sharia law]] and/or an [[Islamic state|Islamic State Caliphate]].\n\nThere are over 120 such groups active today.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Below is a list of major groups active.\n\n=== Groups ===\n{{Expand list|date=October 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n! style=\"width:16%;\"|Group Name\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|Banner\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Home Base\n! style=\"width:12%;\"|Leaders\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Strength\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|Casualties\n! style=\"width:35%;\"|Ideology\n|-\n| '''[[Al-Qaeda]]'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Flag of al-Qaeda.svg|90px]]\n| [[Afghanistan]]/[[Pakistan]] Region\n| |[[Abdallah Azzam]] (founder)<br />[[Osama bin Laden]] (1989\u20132011)<br />[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] (present)\n| 300\u20133,000<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Roggio|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2011/04/how_many_al_qaeda_operatives_a.php |title=How many al Qaeda operatives are now left in Afghanistan? \u2013 Threat Matrix |publisher=Longwarjournal.org |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/21/al-qaeda-afghanistan-comeback_n_1997994.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023084738/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/21/al-qaeda-afghanistan-comeback_n_1997994.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 October 2012 |title=Al Qaeda in Afghanistan Is Attempting A Comeback |work=The Huffington Post |date=21 October 2012 |accessdate=10 April 2014 }}</ref>\n| 4,400 casualties <ref>{{cite web|url=http://npsglobal.org/eng/news/29-non-state-actors/1034-al-qaeda-attackss-death-toll-more-than-4400-lives.html|title=Death toll of Al Qaeda attacks: more than 4,400 lives|publisher=}}</ref>\n| To restore Islam and establish \"true Islamic states,\" implement [[Sharia law]], and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences and other teachings of Islamic author [[Sayyid Qutb]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0 |url-access=registration|quote=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam.|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press.|ref=GKJTPI2002}}</ref> The title translates to \"Organization of the Base of Jihad.\"\n|-\n| '''[[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]]'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Flag of al-Qaeda.svg|90px]]\n|  [[Kabylie|Kabylie Mountains, Algeria]]\n| [[Abdelmalek Droukdel]]\n| 800\u20131,000+<ref>{{cite web| title =Profile: Al-Qaeda in North Africa| url =https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17308138| website =BBC| date = 17 January 2013|accessdate = 2 July 2015}}</ref>\n| 200+\n| '''AQIM''' is an Islamist militant organization which aims to overthrow the  [[Algeria|Algerian government]] and institute an [[Caliphate|Islamic state]].\n|-\n| '''[[Al-Mourabitoun (militant group)|Al-Mourabitoun]]'''<br />a.k.a.

In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Connection to Kharijites ==\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims.

The bezant\u00e9e bordure indicates a connection to the ancient [[Earl of Cornwall|Earls of Cornwall]]]]\n'''John Killigrew''' (c. 1557 \u2013 1605) of [[Arwenack]], near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall, was three times MP for [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]] in 1584, 1586 and 1597, although  he  rarely attended Parliament. He was Vice-Admiral of Cornwall and like his father and grandfather was [[Governor of Pendennis Castle]] (1584\u201398), but was removed from office due to grave suspicions about his loyalty to the Crown. He was heavily in debt throughout his  adult life, and died a ruined man.\n\n==Life==\nLike both his parents, he had notorious dealings with local [[pirates]], in particular with Captain Elliott,  perhaps the most infamous Cornish [[buccaneer]] of his time. In 1587 he was accused of imprisoning the crew of a [[Denmark|Danish]]  ship which had put into [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]  harbour, and seizing its cargo.  He  was threatened with arrest and  with being [[outlawed]], but   escaped punishment, due  to the influence of his uncle Sir Henry Killigrew, a noted [[diplomat]] who enjoyed the full confidence of  Queen [[Elizabeth I]]. He was also accused of frustrating legal proceedings for piracy  against his mother Mary Wolverston, whose  reputation as a pirate was so notorious that she was briefly imprisoned on a charge of piracy  in 1582. \n\nDuring the war with [[Spain]] his loyalty  to the [[English Crown]]  was questioned, although it is possible that he was guilty only of neglect of his official duties. There were rumours that a Cornish-born [[page (servant)|page ]]  at the Spanish Court, whose name was Killigrew, was his natural son, and acted as an intermediary between his father and the Spanish Government.  The English Government, which by now had grave doubts about his loyalty,  may have found these rumours all too credible. When the Spanish [[Raid on Mount's Bay|raided the Cornish coast]] in 1595, it was found that Killigrew had made no efforts to fortify Pendennis Castle (it was said there were \"not two barrels of [[gunpowder]] in the castle\"). This led to allegations that he had been bribed to leave the castle undefended, although the charge  of [[bribery]] was never proved; again it seems that the influence of his uncle Henry was enough to protect him from  punishment.  He may also have benefited from his close family tie to Sir [[Francis Godolphin (1540-1608)|Sir Francis Godolphin]], probably the dominant political figure in Cornwall at the time, who had married his aunt Margaret Killigrew.<ref>Collins, Arthur  ''Peerage of England''  London 1779 Vol. VII  p.294</ref>\n\nIn 1598, after he had spent  a decade defying authority,  the Government finally lost patience, and after hearing him in his own defence,  deprived him of the Governorship of Pendennis, which had been semi-hereditary in the Killigrew family for generations, and his office of Vice-Admiral of  Cornwall. Due to his father's debts and his own extravagance he died in poverty. His last years were a dreary journey in and out of  a [[debtors' prison]]:  he was preserved from utter ruin only by the remnant of his wife's fortune  (and  this eventually ran out) and the generosity of his uncle Sir Henry. To his eldest son John he left a shattered  inheritance.<ref>[[History of Parliament]] biography [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/killigrew-john-ii-1547-1605]</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Sir [[John Killigrew (died 1584)|John IV Killigrew]] (died 1584) of Arwenack, Captain of Pendennis Castle, MP for Lostwithiel 1563 and for Penryn in 1571 and 1572, (elder brother of [[Henry Killigrew (diplomat)|Henry Killigrew]] (c. 1528 \u2013 1603), MP and diplomat and of [[William Killigrew (Chamberlain of the Exchequer)|William Killigrew]] (died 1622), MP and Chamberlain of the Exchequer) by his wife [[Mary Wolverston]], daughter of Philip Wolverston of Wolverston Hall, Suffolk, and widow of Henry Knyvett.<ref>Vivian, 1887, Cornwall, p.268</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\nHe married Dorothy Monck, a daughter of Sir [[Thomas Monk]] (1570\u20131627) of [[Potheridge]],<ref>Vivian, J.L., ed.

The bezant\u00e9e bordure indicates a connection to the ancient [[Earl of Cornwall|Earls of Cornwall]]]]\n'''John Killigrew''' (c. 1557 \u2013 1605) of [[Arwenack]], near [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall, was three times MP for [[Penryn (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn]] in 1584, 1586 and 1597, although  he  rarely attended Parliament. He was Vice-Admiral of Cornwall and like his father and grandfather was [[Governor of Pendennis Castle]] (1584\u201398), but was removed from office due to grave suspicions about his loyalty to the Crown. He was heavily in debt throughout his  adult life, and died a ruined man.\n\n==Life==\nLike both his parents, he had notorious dealings with local [[pirates]], in particular with Captain Elliott,  perhaps the most infamous Cornish [[buccaneer]] of his time. In 1587 he was accused of imprisoning the crew of a [[Denmark|Danish]]  ship which had put into [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]  harbour, and seizing its cargo.  He  was threatened with arrest and  with being [[outlawed]], but   escaped punishment, due  to the influence of his uncle Sir Henry Killigrew, a noted [[diplomat]] who enjoyed the full confidence of  Queen [[Elizabeth I]]. He was also accused of frustrating legal proceedings for piracy  against his mother Mary Wolverston, whose  reputation as a pirate was so notorious that she was briefly imprisoned on a charge of piracy  in 1582. \n\nDuring the war with [[Spain]] his loyalty  to the [[English Crown]]  was questioned, although it is possible that he was guilty only of neglect of his official duties. There were rumours that a Cornish-born [[page (servant)|page ]]  at the Spanish Court, whose name was Killigrew, was his natural son, and acted as an intermediary between his father and the Spanish Government.  The English Government, which by now had grave doubts about his loyalty,  may have found these rumours all too credible. When the Spanish [[Raid on Mount's Bay|raided the Cornish coast]] in 1595, it was found that Killigrew had made no efforts to fortify Pendennis Castle (it was said there were \"not two barrels of [[gunpowder]] in the castle\"). This led to allegations that he had been bribed to leave the castle undefended, although the charge  of [[bribery]] was never proved; again it seems that the influence of his uncle Henry was enough to protect him from  punishment.  He may also have benefited from his close family tie to Sir [[Francis Godolphin (1540-1608)|Sir Francis Godolphin]], probably the dominant political figure in Cornwall at the time, who had married his aunt Margaret Killigrew.<ref>Collins, Arthur  ''Peerage of England''  London 1779 Vol. VII  p.294</ref>\n\nIn 1598, after he had spent  a decade defying authority,  the Government finally lost patience, and after hearing him in his own defence,  deprived him of the Governorship of Pendennis, which had been semi-hereditary in the Killigrew family for generations, and his office of Vice-Admiral of  Cornwall. Due to his father's debts and his own extravagance he died in poverty. His last years were a dreary journey in and out of  a [[debtors' prison]]:  he was preserved from utter ruin only by the remnant of his wife's fortune  (and  this eventually ran out) and the generosity of his uncle Sir Henry. To his eldest son John he left a shattered  inheritance.<ref>[[History of Parliament]] biography [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/killigrew-john-ii-1547-1605]</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nHe was the eldest son and heir of Sir [[John Killigrew (died 1584)|John IV Killigrew]] (died 1584) of Arwenack, Captain of Pendennis Castle, MP for Lostwithiel 1563 and for Penryn in 1571 and 1572, (elder brother of [[Henry Killigrew (diplomat)|Henry Killigrew]] (c. 1528 \u2013 1603), MP and diplomat and of [[William Killigrew (Chamberlain of the Exchequer)|William Killigrew]] (died 1622), MP and Chamberlain of the Exchequer) by his wife [[Mary Wolverston]], daughter of Philip Wolverston of Wolverston Hall, Suffolk, and widow of Henry Knyvett.<ref>Vivian, 1887, Cornwall, p.268</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children==\nHe married Dorothy Monck, a daughter of Sir [[Thomas Monk]] (1570\u20131627) of [[Potheridge]],<ref>Vivian, J.L., ed.

He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand.

Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the TV series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E.

Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary right-wing city gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; The &quot;[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]&quot; sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrightRoss2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Tim Brooke-Taylor and John Cleese, from ''At Last the 1948 Show'', was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch where Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches mentions John Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named &quot;Christine Weadon&quot;, the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD with the title of ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]], however the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]] (and [[Bill Oddie]] joining the series for the second season).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; Describing itself as &quot;An Encyclopedia of the Air&quot;, this series was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nHe also appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (His scene was the final one filmed for the movie). After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nTim appeared, with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden, in the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song &quot;[[Funky Gibbon]]&quot;), and also appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in the sketches &quot;Top of the Form&quot; (with John Cleese, Graham Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; (with John Cleese and Graham Chapman).\n\nBrooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with their song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. Brooke-Taylor also appeared with Graeme Garden in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled &quot;antidote to panel games&quot; ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' which started in 1972, and Tim still appears regularly. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGraeme Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Tim Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game &quot;I Couldn't Disagree More&quot; he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied &quot;I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.&quot; This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nHe appeared as Derek in the popular 1980s sitcom [[Me_and_My_Girl_(TV_series)|Me And My Girl]] 1984-1988.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. He has appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. Around 1982, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''.

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became President of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and had been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 40 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the prestigious [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;&gt;''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;footlights&quot;&gt;''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the West End in London, and then later taken to both New Zealand and to Broadway in the United States in September 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;footlights&quot;/&gt; He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' in which he performed and co-wrote.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] &quot;Did somebody call?&quot; uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the TV series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E. L. Wisty]]. Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary right-wing city gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; The &quot;[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]&quot; sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrightRoss2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Tim Brooke-Taylor and John Cleese, from ''At Last the 1948 Show'', was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch where Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches mentions John Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named &quot;Christine Weadon&quot;, the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD with the title of ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]], however the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]] (and [[Bill Oddie]] joining the series for the second season).&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt; Describing itself as &quot;An Encyclopedia of the Air&quot;, this series was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot; /&gt;\n\nHe also appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' (His scene was the final one filmed for the movie). After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nTim appeared, with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden, in the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song &quot;[[Funky Gibbon]]&quot;), and also appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in the sketches &quot;Top of the Form&quot; (with John Cleese, Graham Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; (with John Cleese and Graham Chapman).\n\nBrooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with their song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. Brooke-Taylor also appeared with Graeme Garden in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled &quot;antidote to panel games&quot; ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' which started in 1972, and Tim still appears regularly. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGraeme Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Tim Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game &quot;I Couldn't Disagree More&quot; he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied &quot;I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.&quot; This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nHe appeared as Derek in the popular 1980s sitcom [[Me_and_My_Girl_(TV_series)|Me And My Girl]] 1984-1988.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show &quot;banter&quot;, but took the quiz itself seriously. He has appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. Around 1982, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''.
