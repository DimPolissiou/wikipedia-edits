Sinai Hospital]] in Miami Beach, Campbell was a concert promoter in Miami, bringing all the hot rap groups of the early 1980s to the city. In 1983, he enrolled in an eight-week study course at public radio station [[WDNA]], learning basic audio editing and production techniques.\n\nIn 1984, he took notice of a single coming from [[California]] named <nowiki>''Revelation''</nowiki> by 2 Live Crew, which consisted of two rappers ([[Fresh Kid Ice]] and Amazing V) and a DJ ([[Mr. Mixx]]). The single was a smash hit on the South Florida club circuit, so he brought them from California to Miami for a performance. He took a special interest in the group and began managing them.\n\n=== 1986: Starting a music label, joining The 2 Live Crew, and groups breakthrough ===\n\nThe group eventually fully relocated in [[Florida]] without Amazing Vee and in 1986, 2 Live Crew recorded ''Throw the D'' with ''Ghetto Bass'' on the B-side, they went into a joint venture with Campbell to start Luke Skyyywalker Records, which was also his first MC name.\n\nShortly after he joined 2 Live Crew. In April of that year [[Brother Marquis]] joined the group in Miami. Campbell gave The 2 Live Crew a record deal and officially joined the group. They exploded on the local scene with their Gold-selling debut album, ''[[The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are]]'' (1986). This made Luke Skyyywalker and his bandmates rap superstars in that area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=THE+2+LIVE+CREW+IS+WHAT+WE+ARE|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== 1988\u20131991: Best selling albums and controversy ===\nIn 1988, the group released their second album, Move Somethin' It was certified Gold and featured the singles \"Move Somethin'\" and \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\". The album improved on the charts from the previous album, making in to #68 on the Billboard 200 and #20 on the Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.\n\nCampbell decided to sell a separate clean version in addition to the explicit version of the album, Move Somethin' (1988), produced by Mr. Mixx. A record store clerk in Alexander City, Alabama, was cited for selling a copy to an undercover police officer in 1988. It was the first time in the United States that a record store owner was held liable for obscenity over music. The charges were dropped after a jury found the record store not guilty. Their following album ''[[Move Somethin' (album)|Move Somethin'<nowiki/>]]'' (1988) also went gold.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=2+LIVE+CREW&ti=MOVE+SOMETHIN'|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|work=[[RIAA]]|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nTheir third album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]'' (1989) became the group's largest seller, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1990, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] ruled that the album was legally obscene;<ref>''Skyywalker Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 739 F.Supp. 578 (S.D.

Sinai Hospital]] in Miami Beach, Campbell was a concert promoter in Miami, bringing all the hot rap groups of the early 1980s to the city. In 1983, he enrolled in an eight-week study course at public radio station [[WDNA]], learning basic audio editing and production techniques.\n\nIn 1984, he took notice of a single coming from [[California]] named <nowiki>''Revelation''</nowiki> by 2 Live Crew, which consisted of two rappers ([[Fresh Kid Ice]] and Amazing V) and a DJ ([[Mr. Mixx]]). The single was a smash hit on the South Florida club circuit, so he brought them from California to Miami for a performance. He took a special interest in the group and began managing them.\n\n=== 1986: Starting a music label, joining The 2 Live Crew, and groups breakthrough ===\n\nThe group eventually fully relocated in [[Florida]] without Amazing Vee and in 1986, 2 Live Crew recorded ''Throw the D'' with ''Ghetto Bass'' on the B-side, they went into a joint venture with Campbell to start Luke Skyyywalker Records, which was also his first MC name.\n\nShortly after he joined 2 Live Crew.

A record store clerk in Alexander City, Alabama, was cited for selling a copy to an undercover police officer in 1988. It was the first time in the United States that a record store owner was held liable for obscenity over music. The charges were dropped after a jury found the record store not guilty.

It was established in the 1130s and prospered in the Middle Ages. In the course of the [[Reformation]] the monastery was disbanded in 1540. Today the buildings are used by the school ''[[Pforta|Landesschule Pforta]]''. The site is located on the tourist route [[Romanesque Road]] and has been nominated by Germany for inclusion in the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Sites]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Interlanguage link multi|Udo I of Naumburg|de|3=Udo I. von Th\u00fcringen|lt=Bishop Udo I of Naumburg}} who belonged to the House of the [[Ludowinger]]s, met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] for the first time at the Imperial Diet in Li\u00e8ge in March 1131. This meeting can be seen as of central significance for the propagation of the Cistercian order in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. For Bishop Udo I, it provided both motivation and opportunity to arrange for a delegation of monks from the [[Walkenried]] Cistercian monastery to settle in a location in the vicinity of the bishop's town of Naumburg in 1137/1138.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenf\u00e4lschungen und die fr\u00fche Geschichte bis 1236.|date=2003|publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag|language=German|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger}}</ref>\n[[File:Monastery_Pforta.jpg|thumb|Cloister]]\nThe monastery complex itself comprises the religious, as well as residential and functional buildings: the [[Minster (church)|\"minster\" (church)]], the cloister and the abbot's chapel as well as numerous functional buildings from the monastery time and the mill stream Kleine Saale which flows through the monastery property.<ref>{{cite book|title=Schulpforte.

It is reminiscent of a [[Roman architecture|Roman]] triumphal arch portal. This elaborately designed facade with its sculptural decoration symbolically expressed the meaning of the Latinised monastery name of ''Porta'', meaning ''Porta Coeli'' \u2013 i.e. \"Gate of Heaven\" \u2013 through its architecture. It has been described as the \u2033most brilliant example of a towerless fa\u00e7ade in Germany\u2033.<ref>{{cite book|title=Die Westfassade''In:''Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta.

Rare elements were still to be found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the infirmary. It constitutes the high point of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] interior design in the local cultural landscape and stands out thanks to the opulent and yet balanced profiles of the wall design above the columns with their many shaft tori and leaping impost heights.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zisterzienserkloster Pforte.

It is situated above the weir in K\u00f6sen and was first referred to in a papal deed of confirmation from 1138. The one-storey building that has survived is dated to the third quarter of the 12th century. The grange was run by bearded lay brothers (''conversi''), including their own [[Mill (grinding)|mills]], workshops and efficient water supply systems in order to enhance the economic independence of the Cistercians.\n\nThe Cistercians managed to enlist parts of the [[peasant]] population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. These people partly worked as conversi, lay brothers, supporting the Cistercians\u2019 local grange economy, and partly they were sent as groups to resettle in [[Silesia]], [[Greater Poland]] or the [[Baltic region]] through the agency and assistance of the Cistercian Order. If the monastery's own financial resources were not adequate for such endeavours, Pforta was able to borrow large amounts of money within the Cistercian Order, foremost from the primary abbey of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]]. Over time, Pforta was thus able to establish a sphere of domination within the area surrounding the monastery.<ref name=\"Bruun\">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Compagnion to the Cistercian Order|last=Bruun|first=Mette B.|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Kleine Saale ===\nFor 1180, it is documented that the Cistercians were given permission to build a [[Saale]] [[weir]] between Wenzendorf on the west bank of the Saale and K\u00f6sen. The construction of this weir was linked to the building of a canal of some 10 kilometres in length, which still exists today and runs from Bad K\u00f6sen via Pforta to just outside Naumburg. It has been called the \"Kleine Saale\" (Little Saale) since the 13th century. This [[canal]] was designed not only to supply drinking and domestic water to the monastery but also to drive a number of mills in K\u00f6sen, at Pforta monastery and in [[Altenburg|Altenburg (Almrich)]]. The mill at Pforte is a monumental, basically Romanesque stone structure, situated between the western monastery wall and the cloister area. A Romanesque chimney indicates that there used to be a blacksmith's workshop. With their elements of medieval architecture, the mill and blacksmith's building is one of the oldest preserved functional buildings in Central Germany.<ref name=\"Burton\">{{cite book|title=The cistericans in the Middle Ages|last=Burton|first=Janet|last2=Kerr|first2=Julie|date=2011|publisher=Boydell Press}}</ref>\nSeveral contracts show that the [[Benedictine monks]] of St George, the [[Canons Regular|canons]] of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the [[Naumburg Cathedral]] chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization of mill streams. A water expert from Pforta monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg Cathedral chapter were assigned to perform the technical maintenance of the Kleine Saale and to settle any disputes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Sankt Marien zur Pforte.

The fact that they purchased that part of the hill above their own vineyard sites is an indication of the beginning of medieval steep slope cultivation, which is an important documentation of the increasing [[Viticulture|wine-growing]] activities on steep slopes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weinkultur an Saale und Unstrut: Protokoll des Wissenschaftlichen Kolloquiums am 28.

The vines were planted irregularly, and different grape varieties were planted together (documented in 1234). Between them, vegetables and other agricultural crops were planted on acres. Fruit-bearing trees or walnut trees as well as hops were also planted together with the vines.

It was established in the 1130s and prospered in the Middle Ages. In the course of the [[Reformation]] the monastery was disbanded in 1540. Today the buildings are used by the school ''[[Pforta|Landesschule Pforta]]''. The site is located on the tourist route [[Romanesque Road]] and has been nominated by Germany for inclusion in the UNESCO list of [[World Heritage Sites]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Interlanguage link multi|Udo I of Naumburg|de|3=Udo I. von Th\u00fcringen|lt=Bishop Udo I of Naumburg}} who belonged to the House of the [[Ludowinger]]s, met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] for the first time at the Imperial Diet in Li\u00e8ge in March 1131. This meeting can be seen as of central significance for the propagation of the Cistercian order in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. For Bishop Udo I, it provided both motivation and opportunity to arrange for a delegation of monks from the [[Walkenried]] Cistercian monastery to settle in a location in the vicinity of the bishop's town of Naumburg in 1137/1138.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenf\u00e4lschungen und die fr\u00fche Geschichte bis 1236.|date=2003|publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag|language=German|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger}}</ref>\n[[File:Monastery_Pforta.jpg|thumb|Cloister]]\nThe monastery complex itself comprises the religious, as well as residential and functional buildings: the [[Minster (church)|\"minster\" (church)]], the cloister and the abbot's chapel as well as numerous functional buildings from the monastery time and the mill stream Kleine Saale which flows through the monastery property.<ref>{{cite book|title=Schulpforte.

It is reminiscent of a [[Roman architecture|Roman]] triumphal arch portal. This elaborately designed facade with its sculptural decoration symbolically expressed the meaning of the Latinised monastery name of ''Porta'', meaning ''Porta Coeli'' \u2013 i.e. \"Gate of heaven\" \u2013 through its architecture. It has been described as the \u2033most brilliant example of a towerless fa\u00e7ade in Germany\u2033.<ref>{{cite book|title=Die Westfassade''In:''Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta.

Rare elements were still to be found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the infirmary. It constitutes the high point of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] interior design in the local cultural landscape and stands out thanks to the opulent and yet balanced profiles of the wall design above the columns with their many shaft tori and leaping impost heights.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zisterzienserkloster Pforte.

It is situated above the weir in K\u00f6sen and was first referred to in a papal deed of confirmation from 1138. The one-storey building that has survived is dated to the third quarter of the 12th century. The grange was run by bearded lay brothers (''conversi''), including their own [[Mill (grinding)|mills]], workshops and efficient water supply systems in order to enhance the economic independence of the Cistercians.\n\nThe Cistercians managed to enlist parts of the [[peasant]] population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. These people partly worked as conversi, lay brothers, supporting the Cistercians\u2019 local grange economy, and partly they were sent as groups to resettle in [[Silesia]], [[Greater Poland]] or the [[Baltic region]] through the agency and assistance of the Cistercian Order. If the monastery's own financial resources were not adequate for such endeavours, Pforta was able to borrow large amounts of money within the Cistercian Order, foremost from the primary abbey of [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]]. Over time, Pforta was thus able to establish a sphere of domination within the area surrounding the monastery.<ref name=\"Bruun\">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Compagnion to the Cistercian Order|last=Bruun|first=Mette B.|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n=== Kleine Saale ===\nFor 1180, it is documented that the Cistercians were given permission to build a [[Saale]] [[weir]] between Wenzendorf on the west bank of the Saale and K\u00f6sen. The construction of this weir was linked to the building of a canal of some 10 kilometres in length, which still exists today and runs from Bad K\u00f6sen via Pforta to just outside Naumburg. It has been called the \"Kleine Saale\" (Little Saale) since the 13th century. This [[canal]] was designed not only to supply drinking and domestic water to the monastery but also to drive a number of mills in K\u00f6sen, at Pforta monastery and in [[Altenburg|Altenburg (Almrich)]]. The mill at Pforte is a monumental, basically Romanesque stone structure, situated between the western monastery wall and the cloister area. A Romanesque chimney indicates that there used to be a blacksmith's workshop. With their elements of medieval architecture, the mill and blacksmith's building is one of the oldest preserved functional buildings in Central Germany.<ref name=\"Burton\">{{cite book|title=The cistericans in the Middle Ages|last=Burton|first=Janet|last2=Kerr|first2=Julie|date=2011|publisher=Boydell Press}}</ref>\nSeveral contracts show that the [[Benedictine monks]] of St George, the [[Canons Regular|canons]] of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the [[Naumburg Cathedral]] chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization of mill streams. A water expert from Pforta monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg Cathedral chapter were assigned to perform the technical maintenance of the Kleine Saale and to settle any disputes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Sankt Marien zur Pforte.

The fact that they purchased that part of the hill above their own vineyard sites is an indication of the beginning of medieval steep slope cultivation, which is an important documentation of the increasing [[Viticulture|wine-growing]] activities on steep slopes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weinkultur an Saale und Unstrut: Protokoll des Wissenschaftlichen Kolloquiums am 28.

The vines were planted irregularly, and different grape varieties were planted together (documented in 1234). Between them, vegetables and other agricultural crops were planted on acres. Fruit-bearing trees or walnut trees as well as hops were also planted together with the vines. The vineyards were enclosed (first documented in 1268), and featured dry stone walls and terraces on the slopes, stairs, water drainage ditches or buildings as early as in the [[High Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Die Zisterzienser und ihre Weinberge in Brandenburg.|date=2010|publisher=Lukas Verlag|language=German|trans-title=The Cistercians and their Vineyards in Brandenburg.|author=Fr\u00f6hlich, Roland}}</ref>\n\n==World heritage nomination==\nThe monastery has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage Site]]s.

{"title_page": "Marvel Masterworks", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2011}}\n'''''Marvel Masterworks''''' is an [[United States|American]] collection of hardcover and [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] [[comic book]] reprints published by [[Marvel Comics]].\n\nThe collection started in 1987, with volumes reprinting the issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[X-Men|The X-Men]]'', and ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. Approximately 10 issues are reprinted in each volume. In 2013, ''Masterworks'' published its 200th volume. The ''Masterworks'' [[Line (comics)|line]] has expanded from such reprints of the 1960s period that fans and historians call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] to include the 1930s\u20131940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]; comics of Marvel's 1950s [[Comics Code Authority|pre-Code]] forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]; and even some reprints from the 1970s period called the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]].\n\nThere is also a black-and-white trade paperback line, ''[[Essential Marvel]]'', with approximately 25 comics per volume; and the full-color, over-sized, hardcover ''[[Marvel Omnibus]]'' line, each volume of which reprints the equivalent of three to four ''Masterworks''.\n\n[[DC Comics]] began publishing its similar collection, ''[[DC Archive Editions]]'', two years later in 1989.\n\n==History==\n\n===First series (1987\u20131993)===\nThe first printing of ''Masterworks'' books from Marvel started in 1987 (three in 1987, four per year after that) and continued until 1994 (27 volumes), most with a suggested retail price of US $29.95 (Hulk $24.95) for the first three years, $34.95 after that (''Silver Surfer Vol. 19'' $44.95). The first printings had a marble-look dust jacket with either light gray, pastels or primary colors; the binding was a faux leather dyed in the color associated with the title (''Marvel Masterworks'', volume number, and title was embossed usually in gold (exceptions: ''The Silver Surfer'', ''Iron Man'') on the spine along with an embossed symbol representing the character(s) of the title on the front) and numbered in the order the volumes were released (e.g., ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'' was #1, ''The Fantastic Four Vol. 1'' was #2). Volumes contained about 10 issues (plus one ''Annual'') and were about 220-260 pages each. Some volumes had fewer pages, such as ''[[Iron Man|The Invincible Iron Man]] Vol. 1'' (197 pages), ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]] Vol. 1'' (150 pages), and ''[[X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]] Vol. 1''-''3'' (each under 200 pages). The end papers featured a \"gallery\" of three sequential ''Masterworks'' covers, along with a partial cover of the next volume in the series (except ''Volume''s ''1'', ''2'' and ''27''). The volume in which the \"gallery\" was printed would always \"hang\" in the third position, preceded by the previous two volumes.  Some volumes have had multiple printings, such as ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'', with seven.\n\n===Trade paperbacks (1992\u20131993)===\nAlso during the original ''Marvel Masterworks'' run between 1992\u20131993, Marvel Comics had published lower-priced [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] editions of selected volumes in the ''Masterworks'' line, but these versions only reprinted half of the contents compared to the hardcover editions. These were:\n\n*''The Amazing Spider-Man Masterworks Vol. 1'' (March 1992) - Reprints ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1-5 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5902-2}})\n*''The Avengers Masterworks Vol. 1'' (October 1993) - Reprints ''The Avengers'' #1-5 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5983-9}})\n*''The Uncanny X-Men Masterworks Vol. 1'' (March 1993) - Reprints ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #1-5 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5964-2}})\n*''The All-New, All Different X-Men Masterworks Vol. 1'' (August 1993) - Reprints ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #94-97 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5988-X}})\n\nEven though on the cover each book was labeled as ''Volume 1'', no subsequent volumes were ever published for these trade paperbacks. Marvel did not try trade paperback versions of the ''Masterworks'' again until 2002 and 2009.\n\n===Second series (1997\u20132002)===\nFrom 1994\u20131996, no new ''Masterworks'' were published, and existing volumes did not get additional printings.  Following this, from 1997 to 2002, the ''Masterworks'' line was revived, when some of the original 27 went back into print with a new style of dust jacket designed by [[Comicraft]], and without the chronological numbering on the spine. Instead, the line used the number of the volume for each particular comic book series. Four new ''Masterworks'' were published from 2000 to 2002, bringing the total then to 31. Only 10 volumes were published in total from this initial relaunch, and they were ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 6'', ''Marvel Masterworks: Daredevil Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 2'', ''Marvel Masterworks: The Mighty Thor Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 3'', ''Marvel Masterworks: X-Men Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 3'', ''Marvel Masterworks: The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'', and ''Marvel Masterworks: The Avengers Vol. 1''. They are now out of print.<ref>{{cite web|title=Collected Comics Library: The Comicraft Marvel Masterworks.|url=http://www.collectedcomicslibrary.com/marvel_masterworks/masterworks_comicraft.html|accessdate=August 17, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119185726/http://www.collectedcomicslibrary.com/marvel_masterworks/masterworks_comicraft.html|archivedate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Relaunch (2003)===\nWith ''[[Namor|The Sub-Mariner]] Vol. 1'', the 32nd ''Masterwork'', Marvel relaunched the line with silver dust jackets in 2003. On the front cover dust jacket, these initial releases had the book's interior contents and creator names on the top of the front cover art image, and the ''Marvel Masterworks'' name under the cover art on the bottom, with the volume number on the spine featured in a black-filled square with silver edging, with a silver font labeling the volume number. Post-2003 afterward, Marvel redesigned the look: the ''Masterworks'' name with the title and volume number now up on top of the cover image, with the interior contents and creator names listed at the bottom of the cover art, and the dust jacket spine numbering filled in a silver square with black lettering font labeling the volume number. From 2002 to 2004, Marvel brought the 31 now-out-of-print volumes back into print, all with the new silver dust jackets. Like the other releases from 1997 on, these dust jackets do not have the chronological numbering. Upon their initial release, however, a limited print run (about 1,000 to 1,500) was produced with variant dust jackets that used the original marble-look style and retained the absolute chronological numbering (only on the dust jacket's spine). These carried a $5 higher suggested retail price than the regular editions (typically US $54.99).\n\nSome changes were made for the new second editions, with some issues/covers re-colored, previously unreprinted pin-up pages added, and some issues were moved between volumes (''Annual'' issues were amongst the changes made, as Marvel wanted to do a more accurate chronological reprinting of their history than the ''Masterworks'' series had previously attained).\n\nStarting with the 33rd volume, ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 6'' (April 2004), Marvel started producing new ''Masterworks'' once again, continuing monthly from August 2004. These new books have also been printed with both regular and variant/original cover styles.\n\n===Trade paperbacks (Barnes & Noble, 2002)===\nIn 2002, Marvel partnered with [[Barnes & Noble]] to produce lower-priced trade paperback (typically US $12.95) versions of selected ''Masterworks'' volumes. Twelve were produced, without dust jackets, and they utilized the silver cover scheme (based off the initial 2002 dust jacket design prior to the 2003 revamping layout).\n\n===Trade paperbacks (2009\u20132015 editions)===\nMarvel announced in 2008 that they had moved their printing plant to China and would reprint the ''Masterworks'' as a trade paperback line for the third time in celebration of the publisher's then-70th anniversary year, reprinting the ''Masterworks'' monthly in the same sequence as they were originally released in the hardcover editions. Like the post-2003 remastered hardcovers relaunch, this trade paperback line also had both regular and limited alternate variant covers that used the original 1987 marble-look style. This series of trade paperbacks reprinted in order of the original hardback releases from ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'' to ''Warlock Vol. 1''.  The ''Marvel Masterworks'' trade paperback series was discontinued in 2015 and somewhat replaced by the new ''[[Marvel Ultimate Collection, Complete Epic and Epic Collection lines|Epic Collection]]'' trade paperback series, which began in 2014.\n\n===''Golden Age Masterworks''===\nIn October 2004, Marvel released its first ''[[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]'' collection, ''Golden Age: Marvel Comics Vol. 1'', launching a new line of ''Masterworks''. This 1939 and 1940s line reprints material by [[Timely Comics]], Marvel's Golden Age predecessor. It is differentiated from the 1960s Silver Age line by the words ''Golden Age'' on each title, and with the regular dust jacket colored gold rather than silver. From ''Golden Age: [[Captain America]] Vol. 1'' (February 2005) onward, these volumes were released quarterly. The line was discontinued in 2012.\n\n===''Atlas Era Masterworks''===\nIn January 2006, with ''Atlas Era: Tales to Astonish Vol. 1'', Marvel began publishing a third line of ''Masterworks'', reprinting 1950s and early 1960s comics of Marvel forerunner company [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. The regular editions of these volumes have red dust jackets instead of silver. The comics reprinted in these volumes were originally produced during a lull in [[superhero]] popularity.  The initial ''Atlas Era Masterworks'' volumes were primarily [[science-fiction]]/[[fantasy]] stories, particularly featuring [[drive-in theater]]-style [[monster]]s. More recent volumes have included other genres, such as pre-Comics Code horror and jungle stories. Marvel started publishing the ''Atlas Era Masterworks'' volumes semi-annually, then quarterly before returning to semi-annual. The line was discontinued in 2013.\n\n==Alphabetical list of ''Marvel Masterworks''==\n{|wikitable width=100%\n |<!-- 3 columns -->\n'''''Golden Age''''' (30)\n*''[[All Winners Comics|All-Winners]]'' Vol. 1\u20134\n*''[[Captain America]]'' {{nowrap|&nbsp;Vol. 1\u20136}}\n*''[[Daring Mystery Comics|Daring Mystery]]'' Vol. 1\u20132\n*''[[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]'' {{nowrap|&nbsp;Vol. 1\u20133}}\n*''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' {{nowrap|&nbsp;Vol. 1\u20137}}\n*''[[Mystic Comics]]'' Vol. 1\n*''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' {{nowrap|&nbsp;Vol. 1\u20133}}\n*''[[U.S.A.

books]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics lines]]\n[[Category:Comic book collection books]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2011}}\n'''''Marvel Masterworks''''' is an [[United States|American]] collection of hardcover and [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] [[comic book]] reprints published by [[Marvel Comics]].\n\nThe collection started in 1987, with volumes reprinting the issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[X-Men|The X-Men]]'', and ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''. Approximately 10 issues are reprinted in each volume. In 2013, ''Masterworks'' published its 200th volume. The ''Masterworks'' [[Line (comics)|line]] has expanded from such reprints of the 1960s period that fans and historians call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] to include the 1930s\u20131940s [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]; comics of Marvel's 1950s [[Comics Code Authority|pre-Code]] forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]; and even some reprints from the 1970s period called the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]].\n\nThere is also a black-and-white trade paperback line, ''[[Essential Marvel]]'', with approximately 25 comics per volume; and the full-color, over-sized, hardcover ''[[Marvel Omnibus]]'' line, each volume of which reprints the equivalent of three to four ''Masterworks''.\n\n[[DC Comics]] began publishing its similar collection, ''[[DC Archive Editions]]'', two years later in 1989.\n\n==History==\n\n===First series (1987\u20131993)===\nThe first printing of ''Masterworks'' books from Marvel started in 1987 (three in 1987, four per year after that) and continued until 1994 (27 volumes), most with a suggested retail price of US $29.95 (Hulk $24.95) for the first three years, $34.95 after that (''Silver Surfer Vol. 19'' $44.95). The first printings had a marble-look dust jacket with either light gray, pastels or primary colors; the binding was a faux leather dyed in the color associated with the title (''Marvel Masterworks'', volume number, and title was embossed usually in gold (exceptions: ''The Silver Surfer'', ''Iron Man'') on the spine along with an embossed symbol representing the character(s) of the title on the front) and numbered in the order the volumes were released (e.g., ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'' was #1, ''The Fantastic Four Vol. 1'' was #2). Volumes contained about 10 issues (plus one ''Annual'') and were about 220-260 pages each. Some volumes had fewer pages, such as ''[[Iron Man|The Invincible Iron Man]] Vol. 1'' (197 pages), ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]] Vol. 1'' (150 pages), and ''[[X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]] Vol. 1''-''3'' (each under 200 pages). The end papers featured a \"gallery\" of three sequential ''Masterworks'' covers, along with a partial cover of the next volume in the series (except ''Volume''s ''1'', ''2'' and ''27''). The volume in which the \"gallery\" was printed would always \"hang\" in the third position, preceded by the previous two volumes.  Some volumes have had multiple printings, such as ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'', with seven.\n\n===Trade paperbacks (1992\u20131993)===\nAlso during the original ''Marvel Masterworks'' run between 1992\u20131993, Marvel Comics had published lower-priced [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] editions of selected volumes in the ''Masterworks'' line, but these versions only reprinted half of the contents compared to the hardcover editions. These were:\n\n*''The Amazing Spider-Man Masterworks Vol. 1'' (March 1992) - Reprints ''Amazing Fantasy'' #15, ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1-5 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5902-2}})\n*''The Avengers Masterworks Vol. 1'' (October 1993) - Reprints ''The Avengers'' #1-5 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5983-9}})\n*''The Uncanny X-Men Masterworks Vol. 1'' (March 1993) - Reprints ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #1-5 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5964-2}})\n*''The All-New, All Different X-Men Masterworks Vol. 1'' (August 1993) - Reprints ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #94-97 ({{ISBN|0-8713-5988-X}})\n\nEven though on the cover each book was labeled as ''Volume 1'', no subsequent volumes were ever published for these trade paperbacks. Marvel did not try trade paperback versions of the ''Masterworks'' again until 2002 and 2009.\n\n===Second series (1997\u20132002)===\nFrom 1994\u20131996, no new ''Masterworks'' were published, and existing volumes did not get additional printings.  Following this, from 1997 to 2002, the ''Masterworks'' line was revived, when some of the original 27 went back into print with a new style of dust jacket designed by [[Comicraft]], and without the chronological numbering on the spine. Instead, the line used the number of the volume for each particular comic book series. Four new ''Masterworks'' were published from 2000 to 2002, bringing the total then to 31. Only 10 volumes were published in total from this initial relaunch, and they were ''Marvel Masterworks: The Fantastic Four Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 6'', ''Marvel Masterworks: Daredevil Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 2'', ''Marvel Masterworks: The Mighty Thor Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 3'', ''Marvel Masterworks: X-Men Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 3'', ''Marvel Masterworks: The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'', and ''Marvel Masterworks: The Avengers Vol. 1''. They are now out of print.<ref>{{cite web|title=Collected Comics Library: The Comicraft Marvel Masterworks.|url=http://www.collectedcomicslibrary.com/marvel_masterworks/masterworks_comicraft.html|accessdate=August 17, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119185726/http://www.collectedcomicslibrary.com/marvel_masterworks/masterworks_comicraft.html|archivedate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Relaunch (2003)===\nWith ''[[Namor|The Sub-Mariner]] Vol. 1'', the 32nd ''Masterwork'', Marvel relaunched the line with silver dust jackets in 2003. On the front cover dust jacket, these initial releases had the book's interior contents and creator names on the top of the front cover art image, and the ''Marvel Masterworks'' name under the cover art on the bottom, with the volume number on the spine featured in a black-filled square with silver edging, with a silver font labeling the volume number. Post-2003 afterward, Marvel redesigned the look: the ''Masterworks'' name with the title and volume number now up on top of the cover image, with the interior contents and creator names listed at the bottom of the cover art, and the dust jacket spine numbering filled in a silver square with black lettering font labeling the volume number. From 2002 to 2004, Marvel brought the 31 now-out-of-print volumes back into print, all with the new silver dust jackets. Like the other releases from 1997 on, these dust jackets do not have the chronological numbering. Upon their initial release, however, a limited print run (about 1,000 to 1,500) was produced with variant dust jackets that used the original marble-look style and retained the absolute chronological numbering (only on the dust jacket's spine). These carried a $5 higher suggested retail price than the regular editions (typically US $54.99).\n\nSome changes were made for the new second editions, with some issues/covers re-colored, previously unreprinted pin-up pages added, and some issues were moved between volumes (''Annual'' issues were amongst the changes made, as Marvel wanted to do a more accurate chronological reprinting of their history than the ''Masterworks'' series had previously attained).\n\nStarting with the 33rd volume, ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 6'' (April 2004), Marvel started producing new ''Masterworks'' once again, continuing monthly from August 2004. These new books have also been printed with both regular and variant/original cover styles.\n\n===Trade paperbacks (Barnes & Noble, 2002)===\nIn 2002, Marvel partnered with [[Barnes & Noble]] to produce lower-priced trade paperback (typically US $12.95) versions of selected ''Masterworks'' volumes. Twelve were produced, without dust jackets, and they utilized the silver cover scheme (based off the initial 2002 dust jacket design prior to the 2003 revamping layout).\n\n===Trade paperbacks (2009\u20132015 editions)===\nMarvel announced in 2008 that they had moved their printing plant to China and would reprint the ''Masterworks'' as a trade paperback line for the third time in celebration of the publisher's then-70th anniversary year, reprinting the ''Masterworks'' monthly in the same sequence as they were originally released in the hardcover editions. Like the post-2003 remastered hardcovers relaunch, this trade paperback line also had both regular and limited alternate variant covers that used the original 1987 marble-look style. This series of trade paperbacks reprinted in order of the original hardback releases from ''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1'' to ''Warlock Vol. 1''.  The ''Marvel Masterworks'' trade paperback series was discontinued in 2015 and somewhat replaced by the new ''[[Marvel Ultimate Collection, Complete Epic and Epic Collection lines|Epic Collection]]'' trade paperback series, which began in 2014.\n\n===''Golden Age Masterworks''===\nIn October 2004, Marvel released its first ''[[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]]'' collection, ''Golden Age: Marvel Comics Vol. 1'', launching a new line of ''Masterworks''. This 1939 and 1940s line reprints material by [[Timely Comics]], Marvel's Golden Age predecessor. It is differentiated from the 1960s Silver Age line by the words ''Golden Age'' on each title, and with the regular dust jacket colored gold rather than silver. From ''Golden Age: [[Captain America]] Vol. 1'' (February 2005) onward, these volumes were released quarterly. The line was discontinued in 2012.\n\n===''Atlas Era Masterworks''===\nIn January 2006, with ''Atlas Era: Tales to Astonish Vol. 1'', Marvel began publishing a third line of ''Masterworks'', reprinting 1950s and early 1960s comics of Marvel forerunner company [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. The regular editions of these volumes have red dust jackets instead of silver. The comics reprinted in these volumes were originally produced during a lull in [[superhero]] popularity.  The initial ''Atlas Era Masterworks'' volumes were primarily [[science-fiction]]/[[fantasy]] stories, particularly featuring [[drive-in theater]]-style [[monster]]s. More recent volumes have included other genres, such as pre-Comics Code horror and jungle stories.

Note that while the ''Uncanny X-Men'', ''Defenders'' and ''Champions'' volumes are from the Bronze Age of Comic Books, they are listed as being Silver Age as per Marvel's categorization. When the variant and the regular cover volume are published on different dates, the regular edition date or scheduled publishing date is listed. When issues have been moved between volumes for later editions, the later edition placement is listed. The \"B&N\" category shows if a [[Barnes & Noble]] trade paperback is available (only 12 were published). The ISBN listed is that of the first-published silver editions (not the variant/embossed foil editions).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right:0\"\n|-\n! #\n! Age/<br />era\n!
