February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' establishment, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] were a pillar of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Bisons hockey team]] played from 1928 to 1936), winning the [[Calder Cup]] in their final season.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Early Years|url=http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|work=The 40th Anniversary site of the Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=April 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307143201/http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|archivedate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWanting a name other than \"[[bison]]\" (a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team contest.

Their first attempt was thwarted when [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]] persuaded his [[horse racing]] friends [[James D. Norris|James]] and [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] to select [[Pittsburgh]] over Buffalo,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/9GS4yb89OsI</ref> while the second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon. At the time of their creation, the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL [[farm team]], the [[Cincinnati Swords]]. Former [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] general manager and head coach [[Punch Imlach]] was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres.\n\nThe year the Sabres debuted (1970) was an important year for major league sports in Buffalo. In addition to the Sabres' debut, the [[Buffalo Bills]] [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|officially joined]] the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Buffalo Braves]] also began to play, sharing Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres. The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] to three in one off-season, a situation that proved to be unsustainable. Between the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two; [[Paul Snyder (basketball)|Paul Snyder]], the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' Braves owner, publicly feuded with the [[old money]] Knoxes and the local [[college basketball]] scene, eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in 1976. Subsequent owners of the Braves, in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]], moved the team out of Buffalo.\n\nWhen the Sabres debuted as an expansion team, they took the ice to [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s Armenian war dance, \"[[Sabre Dance]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artvoice.com/2017/11/01/hockey-sin-city-andrew-kulyk-peter-farrell/#.Ws-U_YjwZuU|title=Hockey in Sin City|work=[[Artvoice]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=November 1, 2017|author=Kulyk, Andrew and Peter Farrell}}</ref> The song has been associated with the team as an unofficial anthem ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://as.com/videos/2016/07/06/en/1467824254_902709.html|title=All about new Manchester United signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=July 6, 2016|work=[[Diario AS]]}}</ref> It is often played between periods and after goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/2222/20120620/teemu-sel-nne-keeps-nhl-94-roster.htm|title=Teemu Sel\u00e4nne Keeps NHL '94 Roster Alive|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=June 20, 2012|work=[[GameNGuide]]|author=Caulfield, Luke}}</ref>\n\nThe consensus was that first pick in the [[1970 NHL Amateur Draft]] would be [[junior hockey|junior]] phenomenon [[Gilbert Perreault]]. Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a [[roulette wheel]]. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the [[Montreal Canadiens]] did not have a priority right to draft [[Quebec]]-born junior players.\n\nThe Canucks were allocated numbers 1\u201310 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11\u201320. When league president [[Clarence Campbell]] spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on one. While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11, effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref> Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie season of [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970\u201371]], at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie, and he received the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's rookie of the year. Despite Perreault's play, the Sabres finished well out of playoff contention.\n[[File:French connection statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of the [[The French Connection (ice hockey)|French Connection]] [[line (ice hockey)|line]] stands outside [[KeyBank Center]].

Martin broke Perreault's record at once with 44 [[rookie]] goals. They were nicknamed \"[[The French Connection (hockey)|The French Connection]]\" after [[The French Connection (film)|the movie of the same name]] and in homage to their [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972\u201373]], just the team's third year in the league, but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual [[Stanley Cup]] champion Montreal Canadiens.\n\nAfter a subpar year in [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1974]] that saw them miss the playoffs (as well as aging defenseman [[Tim Horton]]'s death in a [[driving under the influence|DUI]]-induced car accident), the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1974\u201375]] regular season. Buffalo advanced to the [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time in team history to play against the rough [[Philadelphia Flyers]] (who had been recently nicknamed the \"[[Philadelphia Flyers#1972\u20131978: The Broad Street Bullies|Broad Street Bullies]]\"), a series which included the legendary Fog Game (Game 3 of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 and the lack of air conditioning in the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the fog, Sabres center [[Jim Lorentz]] spotted a [[bat]] flying across the rink, swung at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert's goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games, winning the series 4\u20132.\n\nThe French Connection, joined by 50\u2013goal scorer [[Danny Gare]], continued to score prolifically for the Sabres in [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975\u201376]], but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the [[New York Islanders]]. The Sabres had success through the late 1970s behind Gare and the French Connection (Perreault, Martin and Robert), but they were unable to return to the Finals despite a [[Prince of Wales Trophy|Wales Conference championship]] in [[1979\u201380 NHL season|1980]] and being the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United States. The French Connection era ended with Robert's trade to the [[Colorado Rockies (ice hockey)|Colorado Rockies]] in 1979 and Martin's trade to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in 1981, by which time Martin's career was essentially finished as the result of a devastating knee injury in 1980.\n\n=== Adams/Northeast Division rivalries (1981\u20131996) ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nIn [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1981\u201382]], the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the near-certainty of having to get past either the [[Boston Bruins]] or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over Montreal in 1982\u201383 and Boston in 1992\u201393, the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston, the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and Montreal in the Adams Division semi-finals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the playoffs altogether in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387\u2014only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal mark in the 1985\u201386 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986\u201387, 17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick.\n\nThe Sabres drafted [[Pierre Turgeon]] with the first pick in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 1987\u201388, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. He was joined in 1989 by [[Alexander Mogilny]], who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL, and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow. In the 1989\u201390 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points\u2014third-best in the NHL\u2014but the playoff futility continued with a first-round loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought [[Pat LaFontaine]] to Buffalo.\n\nIn 1992\u201393, goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]] joined the team in a trade from the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. In the [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs|1993 playoffs]], the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semi-finals, their first playoff series victory in ten years. [[Brad May]]'s series-winning goal in overtime of Game 4 in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret's \"May Day!\" call. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by a 4\u20133 score (the last three games in overtime).\n\nWith the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], the Sabres faced the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the Eastern Conference playoffs' first round. Despite Hasek winning a 1\u20130 (quadruple overtime) goaltending duel with the Devils' [[Martin Brodeur]] in Game 6\u2014the Sabres' longest game ever, which went into quadruple overtime\u2014Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994\u201395 season]] was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995\u201396, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was the first season under head coach [[Ted Nolan]] and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo. During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the \"hardest-working team in hockey\".<ref name=BuffNews>{{Cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Budd |title=Ruff front-runner to coach Sabres |journal=The Buffalo News |date=July 18, 1997 |page=1B |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> This season also featured the debut of \"walk-on\" veteran [[Randy Burridge]], who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team [[Most Valuable Player]].\n\nThe final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4\u20131 victory over the [[Hartford Whalers]]. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later, on May 22, 1996.\n\n=== The black and red era (1996\u20132006) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buffalo Sabres Logo 1996-2006.svg|thumb|In 1996 the Sabres' changed their logo as well as their color scheme to red and black. The logo was used until 2006.]] -->\n\nTed Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in [[1996\u201397 NHL season|1996\u201397]], their first at [[Marine Midland Arena]], by winning their first division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as the NHL's top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart]] and [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina]] Trophies (the first goaltender to do so since Montreal's [[Jacques Plante]] in 1962), [[Michael Peca]] taking home the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager [[John Muckler]] honored as Executive of the Year.\n\nHowever, the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season. After being scored upon in Game 3 of the first round against the [[Ottawa Senators]], Hasek left the game, forcing backup [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]] to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]] wrote a column that night for the next day's newspaper that detailed the day's events, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won Game 5, Hasek came out of the Sabres' training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill after the incident. Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games, with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy (Hasek most likely would not have been suspended had he not been cleared to play). Set to return in Game 4 with the Sabres down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination with a win in overtime. Again before Game 5, Hasek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost 6\u20133 and the series.\n\nTeam president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]] fired general manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan, placing new general manager [[Darcy Regier]] in a tough position. He offered Nolan just a one-year contract for a reported $500,000. Nolan refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years. Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending Nolan's tenure as Sabres coach. Nolan was offered several jobs from the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and New York Islanders, which he turned down, and was out of the NHL until June 2006 when he was named coach of the Islanders. Former Sabres captain [[Lindy Ruff]] was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, agreeing to a three-year contract. The Sabres organization, after having their most successful season in nearly two decades, had fired both the reigning NHL Executive of the Year (Muckler) and Coach of the Year (Nolan).\n\n==== New owners and return to the Finals ====\nDuring the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]], the Sabres, which had lost $32&nbsp;million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997,<ref>Knox Family to Sell Sabres, ''The Washington Post'', December 22, 1997</ref> were sold by Northrop Knox to [[John Rigas]], owner of [[Adelphia Communications]]. Shortly thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas' son, Timothy Rigas. Behind Hasek, left-winger [[Miroslav \u0160atan|Miroslav Satan]] (who led the team in scoring), right-winger [[Donald Audette]], center Michael Peca and several role-playing journeymen including [[Matthew Barnaby]], the Sabres reached the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] that season, but lost to the [[Washington Capitals]] in six games.\n[[File:Full House at Buffalo's Former Marine Midland Arena for Buffalo Sabres Hockey, 1999.jpg|left|thumb|The Sabres playing a game during the [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]] season. The Sabres were later crowned the Eastern Conference champions following the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs]].]]\nIn [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], Miroslav Satan scored 40 goals. The Sabres would add centers [[Stu Barnes]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins and [[Jo\u00e9 Juneau|Joe Juneau]] from the Capitals. [[Michal Gro\u0161ek|Michal Grosek]] had the best season of his career, and the team finally returned to the [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], this time against the [[Presidents' Trophy]] winner, the [[Dallas Stars]]. In Game 6, Stars [[winger (sports)|winger]] [[Brett Hull]]'s triple-overtime goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player's skate entered the crease before the puck did. However, NHL officials maintained that Hull's two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender's crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|next year]] was a disappointing season. The team struggled in the regular season, due to injuries to Hasek as well as other tired and discouraged players. [[Doug Gilmour]] was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres to a playoff berth. However, Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during the post-season, and even the Hasek's return could not prevent a first-round playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Like the previous season, there would be an officiating controversy. In Game 2, Flyers left wing [[John LeClair]] put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the \"side\" of the net, the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2\u20131 and go on to win the series four games to one.\n\n[[Captain (hockey)|Captain]] Michael Peca sat out [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]] due to a contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 2001 in exchange for [[Tim Connolly]] and [[Taylor Pyatt]]. Even so, the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs (with a resounding 8\u20130 victory in the series-winning game). In the second round, they faced the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins, led by rejuvenated superstar [[Mario Lemieux]] and captain [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr|Jaromir Jagr]], who had won his fifth [[Art Ross Trophy]] that season, losing on a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman [[Darius Kasparaitis]]. After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres traded Hasek to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the summer of 2001, bringing a five-year era of playoff success to a close. Without Hasek and Peca, the Sabres missed the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2002 playoffs]].\n\n==== Ownership turmoil and lockout ====\nIn May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2&nbsp;billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and presently is appealing a sentence of 15 years in prison. The NHL took control of the team, though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. For a while, there were no interested buyers. After the two-year period of uncertainty, including rumors of relocating to another city or even straight out folding, the team was sold to a consortium led by [[Rochester, New York]], billionaire and former New York gubernatorial candidate [[Tom Golisano]] and former Sabres president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]], whose bid included no government funding. Golisano was introduced as team owner on March 19, 2003.\n\nWith the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]] having started under NHL control, general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger [[Rob Ray]], who was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for young winger [[Michael Ryan (ice hockey)|Michael Ryan]] and a draft pick.\n\nA third deal sent center [[Chris Gratton]] to the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] with a draft pick for [[Daniel Bri\u00e8re|Daniel Briere]] and a draft pick, adding a player who would play a key role in the Sabres' resurgence in later years. The [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 season]] saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and, though the Sabres narrowly missed the playoffs, the development of prominent young players. Although the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] was canceled due to a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|labor]] dispute, the league and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) were able to agree on a new [[collective bargaining]] agreement in the summer of 2005, thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n[[File:Lindyruff 2006nhlawards.jpg|thumb|[[Lindy Ruff]] was awarded the [[Jack Adams Award]] in 2006. He was the second Sabres coach to win the award.]]\nOn January 19, 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the [[Empire Sports Network]] (which had been on the air since 1991) ceased operations in a cost-cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. (Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL's seizure of the franchise.) Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the 2005\u201306 campaign [[Madison Square Garden Network]] (MSG), a New York City-based channel which broadcasts [[New York Rangers]], New York Islanders and [[New Jersey Devils]] games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in [[western New York]], with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement was later extended through 2017, then again through 2027.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 Buffalo Sabres season|2005\u201306]], the Sabres took off, finishing with their best record in over 20 years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2000\u201301 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 1979\u201380 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for the most wins in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in the NHL, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina.\n\nBuffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first-round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]] in six games and top-seeded Ottawa in five games. The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first Eastern Conference Final since [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999]]. However, injuries began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen ([[Teppo Numminen]], [[Dmitri Kalinin]], [[Jay McKee]] and [[Henrik Tallinder]]) and their top [[Power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] scorer (Tim Connolly) for much of the series. Despite this, the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina. The Sabres' impressive season was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach [[Peter Laviolette]] to win the Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year in the closest vote in the award's history. Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award.\n\n=== Return to blue and gold (2006\u20132010) ===\n[[File:Thomas Vanek.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Vanek]] was re-signed in 2007 after the [[Edmonton Oilers]] offered him a seven-year offer sheet.]]\nThe Sabres started the [[2006\u201307 Buffalo Sabres season|2006\u201307 season]] 10\u20130, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history (after the 1994 Toronto Maple Leafs) to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They also set a new NHL record for consecutive road wins to start a season (eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive road wins) with a 7\u20134 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 2006. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise history. The Sabres won the presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise history, giving them the home ice advantage for their entire run in the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]]. They also tied the [[1974\u201375 Buffalo Sabres season|1974\u201375 team]]'s franchise record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive Eastern Conference Finals. However, on May 19, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators after five games.\n\nIn the April 9, 2007, issue of ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]'', the team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North America. The Sabres were cited for their player accessibility, low ticket prices and exciting brand of hockey.<ref name=ESPNmag>{{Cite journal |last=Keating |first=Peter |title=Ultimate Standings: Buffalo Sabres Are No. 1! |journal=ESPN the Magazine |date=March 28, 2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=ultimatestandings07No1team}}</ref>\n\nThe Sabres lost both co-captains, Daniel Briere (who went to the Philadelphia Flyers) and [[Chris Drury]] (who went to the New York Rangers) during the free agency period. The Sabres nearly lost [[Thomas Vanek]] to the [[Edmonton Oilers]], which offered him a seven-year, $50&nbsp;million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator [[Jim Lorentz]] announced his retirement during the pre-season. ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'''s [[Harry Neale]] took over the position in October 2007.\n\n==== Post-Briere\u2013Drury era ====\n[[File:NHL Winter Classic 2008.jpg|thumb|In 2008 the Sabres hosted the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in the inaugural [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]].]]\nDuring the [[2007\u201308 Buffalo Sabres season|2007\u201308 season]], the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 1, 2008, which was played outdoors at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], home of the National Football League's Buffalo Bills.<ref name=nhl>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/winterclassic/index.html |title=2008 Winter Classic |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180538/http://www.nhl.com/winterclassic/index.html |archivedate=May 14, 2008  }}</ref> Officially, the game was called the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic]], known colloquially as the \"Ice Bowl\" due to it taking place at the same time as [[college football]] [[bowl game]]s.

The Sabres failed to qualify for the [[2008 Stanley Cup playoffs|2008 playoffs]] and became only the third team in NHL history to go from finishing first overall in the regular season standings to finishing out of the playoffs the following year.\n\nOn June 10, the Sabres officially announced their new AHL affiliate, beginning in the [[2008\u201309 AHL season|2008\u201309 season]], would be the [[Portland Pirates]] from [[Portland, Maine]].

Three days later, the Sabres acquired [[Craig Rivet]] from the [[San Jose Sharks]] in exchange for a second round draft pick in each of the next two drafts. The Sabres also extended the contracts of three players: [[Paul Gaustad]] (four years), [[Ryan Miller]] (five years) and [[Jason Pominville]] (five years). Miller was slated to become an unrestricted free agent following the upcoming season while Pominville was set to become a restricted free agent.\n\nOn October 8, the Sabres named defenseman [[Craig Rivet]] team captain, the first single full-time captain since [[Stu Barnes]]' term from 2001 to 2003. The team was also active at the trade deadline. First, they signed Tim Connolly to a two-year, $4.2&nbsp;million extension, then acquired [[Mikael Tellqvist]] from the Phoenix Coyotes for a fourth round pick in the [[2010 NHL Entry Draft|2010 draft]]. [[Dominic Moore]] came from the Toronto Maple Leafs for a second-round pick in the [[2009 NHL Entry Draft|2009 draft]], then Buffalo received a second-round pick in the 2009 draft from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for [[Ale\u0161 Kotal\u00edk|Ales Kotalik]].

The team was established in [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970]], along with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], when the league expanded to 14 teams. They have played at [[KeyBank Center]] since [[1996\u201397 Buffalo Sabres season|1996]]. Prior to that, the Buffalo Sabres played at the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] from the start of the franchise in 1970.

Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] variety store chain; along with [[Robert O. Swados]], a Buffalo attorney. On the team's inaugural board of directors were [[Robert E. Rich, Jr.]], later the owner of the [[Buffalo Bisons]] minor league baseball team; and [[George W. Strawbridge, Jr.]], an heir to the [[Campbell Soup Company]] fortune. Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' establishment, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] were a pillar of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Bisons hockey team]] played from 1928 to 1936), winning the [[Calder Cup]] in their final season.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Early Years|url=http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|work=The 40th Anniversary site of the Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=April 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307143201/http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/history.asp?year=1967|archivedate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWanting a name other than \"[[bison]]\" (a generic stock name used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team contest.

Their first attempt was thwarted when [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner [[Art Rooney]] persuaded his [[horse racing]] friends [[James D. Norris|James]] and [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] to select [[Pittsburgh]] over Buffalo,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/9GS4yb89OsI</ref> while the second attempt was due to the NHL not wanting an expansion market to give up on a team so soon. At the time of their creation, the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL [[farm team]], the [[Cincinnati Swords]]. Former [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] general manager and head coach [[Punch Imlach]] was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres.\n\nThe year the Sabres debuted (1970) was an important year for major league sports in Buffalo. In addition to the Sabres' debut, the [[Buffalo Bills]] [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|officially joined]] the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Buffalo Braves]] also began to play, sharing Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres. The city of Buffalo went from having no teams in the established [[major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]] to three in one off-season, a situation that proved to be unsustainable. Between the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be by far the more successful of the two; [[Paul Snyder (basketball)|Paul Snyder]], the ''[[nouveau riche]]'' Braves owner, publicly feuded with the [[old money]] Knoxes and the local [[college basketball]] scene, eventually losing those feuds and being forced to sell his team in 1976. Subsequent owners of the Braves, in a series of convoluted transactions tied to the [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]], moved the team out of Buffalo.\n\nWhen the Sabres debuted as an expansion team, they took the ice to [[Aram Khachaturian]]'s Armenian war dance, \"[[Sabre Dance]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artvoice.com/2017/11/01/hockey-sin-city-andrew-kulyk-peter-farrell/#.Ws-U_YjwZuU|title=Hockey in Sin City|work=[[Artvoice]]|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=November 1, 2017|author=Kulyk, Andrew and Peter Farrell}}</ref> The song has been associated with the team as an unofficial anthem ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://as.com/videos/2016/07/06/en/1467824254_902709.html|title=All about new Manchester United signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=July 6, 2016|work=[[Diario AS]]}}</ref> It is often played between periods and after goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/2222/20120620/teemu-sel-nne-keeps-nhl-94-roster.htm|title=Teemu Sel\u00e4nne Keeps NHL '94 Roster Alive|accessdate=April 12, 2018|date=June 20, 2012|work=[[GameNGuide]]|author=Caulfield, Luke}}</ref>\n\nThe consensus was that first pick in the [[1970 NHL Amateur Draft]] would be [[junior hockey|junior]] phenomenon [[Gilbert Perreault]]. Either the Sabres or the Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a [[roulette wheel]]. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the first year the [[Montreal Canadiens]] did not have a priority right to draft [[Quebec]]-born junior players.\n\nThe Canucks were allocated numbers 1\u201310 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11\u201320. When league president [[Clarence Campbell]] spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on one. While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11, effectively handing Perreault to the Sabres.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |authorlink= |title=Hockey Chronicles |year=2001 |publisher=Checkmark Books |location=New York City |isbn=0-8160-4697-2 |display-authors=etal |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hockeychronicles00tren }}</ref> Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie season of [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970\u201371]], at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL rookie, and he received the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] as the NHL's rookie of the year. Despite Perreault's play, the Sabres finished well out of playoff contention.\n[[File:French connection statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of the [[The French Connection (ice hockey)|French Connection]] [[line (ice hockey)|line]] stands outside [[KeyBank Center]]. Consisting of [[Gilbert Perreault]], [[Rick Martin]], and [[Rene Robert]], they played together from 1972 to 1979.]]\nIn the team's second season, [[1971\u201372 NHL season|1971\u201372]], rookie [[Rick Martin]], drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in [[1971 NHL Amateur Draft|1971]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Robert|Rene Robert]], acquired in a late-season trade from the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], joined Perreault and would become one of the league's top forward lines in the 1970s. Martin broke Perreault's record at once with 44 [[rookie]] goals. They were nicknamed \"[[The French Connection (hockey)|The French Connection]]\" after [[The French Connection (film)|the movie of the same name]] and in homage to their [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first time in [[1972\u201373 NHL season|1972\u201373]], just the team's third year in the league, but lost in the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual [[Stanley Cup]] champion Montreal Canadiens.\n\nAfter a subpar year in [[1973\u201374 NHL season|1974]] that saw them miss the playoffs (as well as aging defenseman [[Tim Horton]]'s death in a [[driving under the influence|DUI]]-induced car accident), the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the [[1974\u201375 NHL season|1974\u201375]] regular season. Buffalo advanced to the [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] for the first time in team history to play against the rough [[Philadelphia Flyers]] (who had been recently nicknamed the \"[[Philadelphia Flyers#1972\u20131978: The Broad Street Bullies|Broad Street Bullies]]\"), a series which included the legendary Fog Game (Game 3 of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 and the lack of air conditioning in the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], parts of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the fog, Sabres center [[Jim Lorentz]] spotted a [[bat]] flying across the rink, swung at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to Rene Robert's goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking the Stanley Cup in six games, winning the series 4\u20132.\n\nThe French Connection, joined by 50\u2013goal scorer [[Danny Gare]], continued to score prolifically for the Sabres in [[1975\u201376 NHL season|1975\u201376]], but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the [[New York Islanders]]. The Sabres had success through the late 1970s behind Gare and the French Connection (Perreault, Martin and Robert), but they were unable to return to the Finals despite a [[Prince of Wales Trophy|Wales Conference championship]] in [[1979\u201380 NHL season|1980]] and being the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United States. The French Connection era ended with Robert's trade to the [[Colorado Rockies (ice hockey)|Colorado Rockies]] in 1979 and Martin's trade to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in 1981, by which time Martin's career was essentially finished as the result of a devastating knee injury in 1980.\n\n=== Adams/Northeast Division rivalries (1981\u20131996) ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2019}}\nIn [[1981\u201382 NHL season|1981\u201382]], the NHL realigned its conferences and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the near-certainty of having to get past either the [[Boston Bruins]] or Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over Montreal in 1982\u201383 and Boston in 1992\u201393, the era saw the Sabres lose to division rivals Boston, the [[Quebec Nordiques]] and Montreal in the Adams Division semi-finals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the playoffs altogether in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387\u2014only third and fourth times out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal mark in the 1985\u201386 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986\u201387, 17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick.\n\nThe Sabres drafted [[Pierre Turgeon]] with the first pick in the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 1987\u201388, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in three years. He was joined in 1989 by [[Alexander Mogilny]], who with the help of Sabres officials became the first Soviet player to defect to the NHL, and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow. In the 1989\u201390 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points\u2014third-best in the NHL\u2014but the playoff futility continued with a first-round loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought [[Pat LaFontaine]] to Buffalo.\n\nIn 1992\u201393, goaltender [[Dominik Ha\u0161ek|Dominik Hasek]] joined the team in a trade from the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. In the [[1993 Stanley Cup playoffs|1993 playoffs]], the Sabres upset the Bruins in a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semi-finals, their first playoff series victory in ten years. [[Brad May]]'s series-winning goal in overtime of Game 4 in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret's \"May Day!\" call. However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by a 4\u20133 score (the last three games in overtime).\n\nWith the NHL adopting a conference playoff format for the [[1993\u201394 NHL season|1993\u201394 season]], the Sabres faced the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the Eastern Conference playoffs' first round. Despite Hasek winning a 1\u20130 (quadruple overtime) goaltending duel with the Devils' [[Martin Brodeur]] in Game 6\u2014the Sabres' longest game ever, which went into quadruple overtime\u2014Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened [[1994\u201395 NHL season|1994\u201395 season]] was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995\u201396, as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was the first season under head coach [[Ted Nolan]] and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo. During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the \"hardest-working team in hockey\".<ref name=BuffNews>{{Cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Budd |title=Ruff front-runner to coach Sabres |journal=The Buffalo News |date=July 18, 1997 |page=1B |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> This season also featured the debut of \"walk-on\" veteran [[Randy Burridge]], who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team [[Most Valuable Player]].\n\nThe final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4\u20131 victory over the [[Hartford Whalers]]. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox died a month later, on May 22, 1996.\n\n=== The black and red era (1996\u20132006) ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buffalo Sabres Logo 1996-2006.svg|thumb|In 1996 the Sabres' changed their logo as well as their color scheme to red and black. The logo was used until 2006.]] -->\n\nTed Nolan and the Sabres rebounded in [[1996\u201397 NHL season|1996\u201397]], their first at [[Marine Midland Arena]], by winning their first division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the [[Jack Adams Award]] as the NHL's top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart]] and [[Vezina Trophy|Vezina]] Trophies (the first goaltender to do so since Montreal's [[Jacques Plante]] in 1962), [[Michael Peca]] taking home the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] as the best defensive forward in the NHL and general manager [[John Muckler]] honored as Executive of the Year.\n\nHowever, the regular season success was overshadowed by what had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had been high for most of the season. After being scored upon in Game 3 of the first round against the [[Ottawa Senators]], Hasek left the game, forcing backup [[Steve Shields (hockey player)|Steve Shields]] to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' columnist [[Jim Kelley]] wrote a column that night for the next day's newspaper that detailed the day's events, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won Game 5, Hasek came out of the Sabres' training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill after the incident. Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced Hasek had been suspended for three games, with the Sabres informing the NHL Hasek was healthy (Hasek most likely would not have been suspended had he not been cleared to play). Set to return in Game 4 with the Sabres down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination with a win in overtime. Again before Game 5, Hasek declared himself unfit to play and Buffalo lost 6\u20133 and the series.\n\nTeam president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]] fired general manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony he did not respect Nolan, placing new general manager [[Darcy Regier]] in a tough position. He offered Nolan just a one-year contract for a reported $500,000. Nolan refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years. Regier then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending Nolan's tenure as Sabres coach. Nolan was offered several jobs from the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] and New York Islanders, which he turned down, and was out of the NHL until June 2006 when he was named coach of the Islanders. Former Sabres captain [[Lindy Ruff]] was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, agreeing to a three-year contract. The Sabres organization, after having their most successful season in nearly two decades, had fired both the reigning NHL Executive of the Year (Muckler) and Coach of the Year (Nolan).\n\n==== New owners and return to the Finals ====\nDuring the [[1997\u201398 NHL season|1997\u201398 season]], the Sabres, which had lost $32&nbsp;million over the previous three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997,<ref>Knox Family to Sell Sabres, ''The Washington Post'', December 22, 1997</ref> were sold by Northrop Knox to [[John Rigas]], owner of [[Adelphia Communications]]. Shortly thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas' son, Timothy Rigas. Behind Hasek, left-winger [[Miroslav \u0160atan|Miroslav Satan]] (who led the team in scoring), right-winger [[Donald Audette]], center Michael Peca and several role-playing journeymen including [[Matthew Barnaby]], the Sabres reached the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] that season, but lost to the [[Washington Capitals]] in six games.\n[[File:Full House at Buffalo's Former Marine Midland Arena for Buffalo Sabres Hockey, 1999.jpg|left|thumb|The Sabres playing a game during the [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]] season. The Sabres were later crowned the Eastern Conference champions following the [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs]].]]\nIn [[1998\u201399 NHL season|1998\u201399]], Miroslav Satan scored 40 goals. The Sabres would add centers [[Stu Barnes]] from the Pittsburgh Penguins and [[Jo\u00e9 Juneau|Joe Juneau]] from the Capitals. [[Michal Gro\u0161ek|Michal Grosek]] had the best season of his career, and the team finally returned to the [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]], this time against the [[Presidents' Trophy]] winner, the [[Dallas Stars]]. In Game 6, Stars [[winger (sports)|winger]] [[Brett Hull]]'s triple-overtime goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player's skate entered the crease before the puck did. However, NHL officials maintained that Hull's two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender's crease as long as they do not interfere with the goaltender.\n\nThe [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|next year]] was a disappointing season. The team struggled in the regular season, due to injuries to Hasek as well as other tired and discouraged players. [[Doug Gilmour]] was acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres to a playoff berth. However, Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during the post-season, and even the Hasek's return could not prevent a first-round playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Like the previous season, there would be an officiating controversy. In Game 2, Flyers left wing [[John LeClair]] put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While replays appeared to show the puck entering through the \"side\" of the net, the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2\u20131 and go on to win the series four games to one.\n\n[[Captain (hockey)|Captain]] Michael Peca sat out [[2000\u201301 NHL season|2000\u201301]] due to a contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 2001 in exchange for [[Tim Connolly]] and [[Taylor Pyatt]]. Even so, the Sabres still defeated Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs (with a resounding 8\u20130 victory in the series-winning game). In the second round, they faced the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins, led by rejuvenated superstar [[Mario Lemieux]] and captain [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr|Jaromir Jagr]], who had won his fifth [[Art Ross Trophy]] that season, losing on a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman [[Darius Kasparaitis]]. After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres traded Hasek to the [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the summer of 2001, bringing a five-year era of playoff success to a close. Without Hasek and Peca, the Sabres missed the [[2001\u201302 NHL season|2002 playoffs]].\n\n==== Ownership turmoil and lockout ====\nIn May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2&nbsp;billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and presently is appealing a sentence of 15 years in prison. The NHL took control of the team, though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. For a while, there were no interested buyers. After the two-year period of uncertainty, including rumors of relocating to another city or even straight out folding, the team was sold to a consortium led by [[Rochester, New York]], billionaire and former New York gubernatorial candidate [[Tom Golisano]] and former Sabres president [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]], whose bid included no government funding. Golisano was introduced as team owner on March 19, 2003.\n\nWith the [[2002\u201303 NHL season|2002\u201303 season]] having started under NHL control, general manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger [[Rob Ray]], who was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars in exchange for young winger [[Michael Ryan (ice hockey)|Michael Ryan]] and a draft pick.\n\nA third deal sent center [[Chris Gratton]] to the [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] with a draft pick for [[Daniel Bri\u00e8re|Daniel Briere]] and a draft pick, adding a player who would play a key role in the Sabres' resurgence in later years. The [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304 season]] saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and, though the Sabres narrowly missed the playoffs, the development of prominent young players. Although the [[2004\u201305 NHL season]] was canceled due to a [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout|labor]] dispute, the league and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) were able to agree on a new [[collective bargaining]] agreement in the summer of 2005, thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306 season]].\n[[File:Lindyruff 2006nhlawards.jpg|thumb|[[Lindy Ruff]] was awarded the [[Jack Adams Award]] in 2006. He was the second Sabres coach to win the award.]]\nOn January 19, 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the [[Empire Sports Network]] (which had been on the air since 1991) ceased operations in a cost-cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. (Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL's seizure of the franchise.) Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts and for the 2005\u201306 campaign [[Madison Square Garden Network]] (MSG), a New York City-based channel which broadcasts [[New York Rangers]], New York Islanders and [[New Jersey Devils]] games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games to television viewers in [[western New York]], with the Sabres controlling all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement was later extended through 2017, then again through 2027.\n\nIn [[2005\u201306 Buffalo Sabres season|2005\u201306]], the Sabres took off, finishing with their best record in over 20 years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 2000\u201301 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 1979\u201380 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and [[Carolina Hurricanes]] for the most wins in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in the NHL, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina.\n\nBuffalo defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first-round of the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|2006 playoffs]] in six games and top-seeded Ottawa in five games. The Sabres advanced to play Carolina in their first Eastern Conference Final since [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999]]. However, injuries began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen ([[Teppo Numminen]], [[Dmitri Kalinin]], [[Jay McKee]] and [[Henrik Tallinder]]) and their top [[Power play (sporting term)|powerplay]] scorer (Tim Connolly) for much of the series. Despite this, the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina. The Sabres' impressive season was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony when Lindy Ruff edged Hurricanes coach [[Peter Laviolette]] to win the Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year in the closest vote in the award's history. Ruff was the second Sabres coach to win the award.\n\n=== Return to blue and gold (2006\u20132010) ===\n[[File:Thomas Vanek.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Vanek]] was re-signed in 2007 after the [[Edmonton Oilers]] offered him a seven-year offer sheet.]]\nThe Sabres started the [[2006\u201307 Buffalo Sabres season|2006\u201307 season]] 10\u20130, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history (after the 1994 Toronto Maple Leafs) to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They also set a new NHL record for consecutive road wins to start a season (eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive road wins) with a 7\u20134 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 2006. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise history. The Sabres won the presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise history, giving them the home ice advantage for their entire run in the [[2007 Stanley Cup playoffs|2007 playoffs]]. They also tied the [[1974\u201375 Buffalo Sabres season|1974\u201375 team]]'s franchise record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive Eastern Conference Finals. However, on May 19, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators after five games.\n\nIn the April 9, 2007, issue of ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]'', the team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North America. The Sabres were cited for their player accessibility, low ticket prices and exciting brand of hockey.<ref name=ESPNmag>{{Cite journal |last=Keating |first=Peter |title=Ultimate Standings: Buffalo Sabres Are No. 1! |journal=ESPN the Magazine |date=March 28, 2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=ultimatestandings07No1team}}</ref>\n\nThe Sabres lost both co-captains, Daniel Briere (who went to the Philadelphia Flyers) and [[Chris Drury]] (who went to the New York Rangers) during the free agency period. The Sabres nearly lost [[Thomas Vanek]] to the [[Edmonton Oilers]], which offered him a seven-year, $50&nbsp;million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator [[Jim Lorentz]] announced his retirement during the pre-season. ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'''s [[Harry Neale]] took over the position in October 2007.\n\n==== Post-Briere\u2013Drury era ====\n[[File:NHL Winter Classic 2008.jpg|thumb|In 2008 the Sabres hosted the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in the inaugural [[2008 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]].]]\nDuring the [[2007\u201308 Buffalo Sabres season|2007\u201308 season]], the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 1, 2008, which was played outdoors at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], home of the National Football League's Buffalo Bills.<ref name=nhl>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/winterclassic/index.html |title=2008 Winter Classic |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514180538/http://www.nhl.com/winterclassic/index.html |archivedate=May 14, 2008  }}</ref> Officially, the game was called the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic]], known colloquially as the \"Ice Bowl\" due to it taking place at the same time as [[college football]] [[bowl game]]s.

Three days later, the Sabres acquired [[Craig Rivet]] from the [[San Jose Sharks]] in exchange for a second round draft pick in each of the next two drafts. The Sabres also extended the contracts of three players: [[Paul Gaustad]] (four years), [[Ryan Miller]] (five years) and [[Jason Pominville]] (five years). Miller was slated to become an unrestricted free agent following the upcoming season while Pominville was set to become a restricted free agent.\n\nOn October 8, the Sabres named defenseman [[Craig Rivet]] team captain, the first single full-time captain since [[Stu Barnes]]' term from 2001 to 2003. The team was also active at the trade deadline. First, they signed Tim Connolly to a two-year, $4.2&nbsp;million extension, then acquired [[Mikael Tellqvist]] from the Phoenix Coyotes for a fourth round pick in the [[2010 NHL Entry Draft|2010 draft]].

Anthony is the English for the Dutch Anthonis or Antoon, though Anthonie, Antonio or Anthonio was also used; in French he is often Antoine, in Italian Anthonio or Antonio. In English a capitalised \"Van\" in Van Dyck was more usual until recent decades (used by Waterhouse for example), and \"Dyke\" was often used during his lifetime and later (and is usual for the beard style).</ref> 22 March 1599&nbsp;\u2013 9 December 1641) was a [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque artist]] who became the leading [[court painter]] in England after success in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and Italy.\n\nThe seventh child of Frans van Dyck, a wealthy [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] silk merchant, Anthony painted from an early age. He was successful as an independent painter his late teens, and became a master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke|Antwerp guild]] in 1618. By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who became a major influence on his work.  Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired ''Iconography'' series of portrait [[etching]]s, mostly of other artists.  He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632 he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of [[Charles I of England]].\n\nWith the exception of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], van Dyck and his contemporary [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. He is best known for his portraits of the aristocracy, most notably Charles I, and his family and associates. Van Dyck became the dominant influence on [[English school of painting|English portrait-painting]] for the next 150 years. He also painted [[mythological]] and [[biblical]] subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in [[watercolour]] and [[etching]].  His superb brushwork, apparently rather quickly painted, can usually be distinguished from the large areas painted by his many assistants.  His portrait style changed considerably between the different countries he worked in, culminating in the relaxed elegance of his last English period.  His influence extends into the modern period. The [[Van Dyke beard]] is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]], and he was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], an indication of his standing at the time of his death.\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 008b.jpg|thumb|left|''Self-portrait'', 1613\u201314]]\n\n===Education===\nAntoon van Dyck (his Flemish name) was born to prosperous parents in Antwerp.

It has been speculated that van Dyck was a pupil of Rubens from about 1613, as even his early work shows little trace of van Balen's style, but there is no clear evidence for this.<ref name=\"EW\">Ellis Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530-1790'', 4th Edn, 1978, pp. 70-77, Penguin Books (now Yale History of Art series)</ref> At the same time the dominance of Rubens in the relatively small and declining city of Antwerp probably explains why, despite his periodic returns to the city, van Dyck spent most of his career abroad.<ref name=\"EW\" /> In 1620, in Rubens's contract for the major commission for the ceiling of the [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]], the [[Jesuit]] church at Antwerp (lost to fire in 1718), van Dyck is specified as one of the \"discipelen\" who was to execute the paintings to Rubens' designs.<ref name=\"Martin, op and page cit\">Martin, op and page cit.</ref> Unlike van Dyck, Rubens worked for most of the courts of Europe, but avoided exclusive attachment to any of them.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 012.jpg|thumb|Genoan hauteur from the Lomellini family, 1623]]\nIn 1620, at the instigation of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham]], van Dyck went to England for the first time where he worked for King [[James I of England]], receiving \u00a3100.<ref name=\"EW\" /> It was in [[London]] in the collection of the [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]] that he first saw the work of [[Titian]], whose use of colour and subtle modeling of form would prove transformational, offering a new stylistic language that would enrich the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.<ref>Brown, page 19.</ref>\n\nAfter about four months, he returned to Flanders, but left in late 1621 for Italy, where he remained for six years. There he studied the Italian masters while starting his career as a successful portraitist. He was already presenting himself as a figure of consequence, annoying the rather bohemian Northern artist's colony in [[Rome]], says [[Giovan Pietro Bellori]], by appearing with \"the pomp of [[Zeuxis]] ... his behaviour was that of a nobleman rather than an ordinary person, and he shone in rich garments. Since he was accustomed in the circle of Rubens to noblemen, and being naturally of elevated mind, and anxious to make himself distinguished, he therefore wore\u2014as well as silks\u2014a hat with feathers and brooches, gold chains across his chest, and was accompanied by servants.\"<ref>[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''Painting at Court'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1971, pp. 124-5</ref>\n[[File:Anthony Van Dyck, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|225px|left|''Anthony van Dyck'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1627\u201328)]]\nHe was mostly based in [[Genoa]], although he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed for some time in [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]], where he was quarantined during the 1624 plague, one of the worst in Sicily's history. There he produced an important series of paintings of the city's plague saint [[Saint Rosalia]]. His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward and was extremely influential for Italian Baroque painters, from [[Luca Giordano]] to [[Pietro Novelli]]. Versions include those in [[Saint Rosalia (Anthony van Dyck)|Madrid]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Houston)|Houston]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (London)|London]], [[Saint Rosalie Interceding for the Plague\u2013Stricken of Palermo|New York]] and [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Palermo)|Palermo]], as well as [[Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo]] in Puerto Rico, and [[Coronation of Saint Rosalia]] in Vienna.

In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of [[Brussels]] he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630, he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large [[altarpiece]]s, and began his printmaking.\n\n===London===\n[[File:Sir-Anthony-van-Dyck-Lord-John-Stuart-and-His-Brother-Lord-Bernard-Stuart.jpg|thumb|''[[Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart]]'', c. 1638, exemplifies the more intimate, but still elegant style he developed in England]]\nKing Charles I was the most passionate collector of art among the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings]], and saw painting as a way of promoting his elevated view of the monarchy. In 1628, he bought the fabulous collection that the [[Charles I, Duke of Mantua|Duke of Mantua]] was forced to sell, and he had been trying since his accession in 1625 to bring leading foreign painters to England. In 1626, he was able to persuade [[Orazio Gentileschi]] to settle in England, later to be joined by his daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi|Artemisia]] and some of his sons. Rubens was an especial target, who eventually in 1630 came on a diplomatic mission, which included painting, and he later sent Charles more paintings from Antwerp. Rubens was very well-treated during his nine-month visit, during which he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. Charles's court portraitist, [[Daniel Mytens]], was a somewhat pedestrian Dutchman. Charles was very short, less than {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, and presented challenges to a portrait artist.\n\nVan Dyck had remained in touch with the English court and helped King Charles's agents in their search for pictures. He sent some of his own works, including a self portrait (1623) with [[Endymion Porter]], one of Charles's agents ''Rinaldo and [[Armida]]'' (1629), and a religious picture for the Queen. He had also painted Charles's sister, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia]], at [[The Hague]] in 1632. In April of that year, van Dyck returned to London and was taken under the wing of the court immediately, being knighted in July and at the same time receiving a pension of \u00a3200 a year, in the grant of which he was described as ''[[Principal Painter in Ordinary|principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties]]''.<ref name=\"Grosvenor Gallery Stephens 1887 p. 14\">{{cite book |author=Grosvenor Gallery |last2=Stephens |first2=F.G. |title=Exhibition of the Works of Sir Anthony Van Dyck |publisher=H.

He was provided with a house on the [[River Thames]] at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the [[City of London|City]], thus avoiding the monopoly of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. A suite of rooms in [[Eltham Palace]], no longer used by the royal family, was also put at his disposal as a country retreat. His Blackfriars studio was frequently visited by the King and Queen (later a special causeway was built to ease their access), who hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived.<ref name=\"EW\" />{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 044.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Charles I at the Hunt]]'', c. 1635, Louvre]]\nHe was an immediate success in England, rapidly painting a large number of portraits of the King and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], as well as their children. Many portraits were done in several versions, to be sent as diplomatic gifts or given to supporters of the increasingly embattled king. Altogether van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of the Queen, nine of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]], and multiple ones of other courtiers.<ref>Gaunt, William, ''English Court Painting''</ref> He painted many of the court, and also himself and his mistress, Margaret Lemon.\n\nIn England he developed a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting to the end of the 18th century. Many of these portraits have a lush landscape background. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian's Emperor Charles V, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the [[Louvre]]: \"Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King\".<ref>Levey p. 128</ref> Although his portraits have created the classic idea of \"[[Cavalier]]\" style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as [[Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton|Lord Wharton]] and the Earls of [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]] and [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], took the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] side in the [[English Civil War]] that broke out soon after his death.{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n[[File:Anton Van Dyck - Christ carrying the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Christ carrying the Cross'']]\nThe King [[Queen in Council|in]] [[Privy Council of England|Council]] by [[letters patent]] granted van Dyck ''[[denization|denizenship]]'' in 1638, and he married Mary, the daughter of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie#Family|Patrick Ruthven]], who, although the title was forfeited, styled himself [[Earl of Gowrie#Lords Ruthven (1488)|Lord Ruthven]].<ref>Cokayne, G.

Van Dyck tried to persuade Charles to commission large-scale series on the history of the [[Order of the Garter]] for the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]], for which Rubens had earlier done the huge ceiling paintings (sending them from Antwerp). A sketch for one wall remains, but by 1638 Charles was too short of money to proceed.<ref name=\"EW\" /> This was a problem Vel\u00e1zquez did not have, but equally van Dyck's daily life was not encumbered by trivial court duties as Vel\u00e1zquez's was. In his visits to Paris in his last years van Dyck tried to obtain the commission to paint the Grande Gallerie of the [[Louvre]] without success.<ref>Levey, op cit p. 136</ref>\n\nA list of history paintings produced by van Dyck in England survives. It was compiled by van Dyck's biographer Bellori, based on information from [[Sir Kenelm Digby]].  None of these works appear to remain, except the ''Eros and Psyche'' done for the King (below).<ref name=\"EW\" /> But many other works, rather more religious than mythological, do survive, and though they are very fine, they do not reach the heights of Vel\u00e1zquez's history paintings. Earlier ones remain very much within the style of Rubens, although some of his Sicilian works are individualistic.\n\nVan Dyck's portraits flattered more than Vel\u00e1zquez's. When [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover]], first met Queen Henrietta Maria, in exile in Holland in 1641, she wrote: \"Van Dyck's handsome portraits had given me so fine an idea of the beauty of all English ladies, that I was surprised to find that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth...\"<ref name=\"EW\" />\n[[File:The Cheeke Sisters by Van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|''The Cheeke Sisters'', a late double portrait]]\nSome critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition\u2014of painters such as [[William Dobson]], [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]] and [[Isaac Fuller]]\u2014into what certainly became elegant blandness in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, like [[Peter Lely|Lely]] or [[Godfrey Kneller|Kneller]].<ref name=\"EW\" /> The conventional view has always been more favourable: \"When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art\" (Jonathan Richardson: ''An Essay on the Theory of Painting'', 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed \"We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company.\"{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\nA fairly small number of [[Landscape art|landscape]] pen and wash drawings or [[watercolour]]s made in England played an important part in introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.<ref>Royalton-Kisch, Martin.

Van Dyck produced drawings, and for eighteen of the portraits he himself [[etching|etched]] with great brilliance the heads and the main outlines of the figure, for an [[engraving|engraver]] to work up: \"Portrait etching had scarcely had an existence before his time, and in his work it suddenly appears at the highest point ever reached in the art\".<ref name=\"Hind\">Arthur M.

Some exist in further [[state (printmaking)|states]] after engraving had been added, sometimes obscuring his etching. He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added [[Inigo Jones]] whilst in London.\n\nThe series was a great success, but was his only venture into printmaking; portraiture probably paid better, and he was constantly in demand. At his death there were eighty plates by others, of which fifty-two were of artists, as well as his own eighteen. The plates were bought by a publisher; with the plates reworked periodically as they wore out they continued to be printed for centuries, and the series added to, so that it reached over two hundred portraits by the late 18th century. In 1851, the plates were bought by the ''Calcographie du [[Louvre]]''.<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nThe ''Iconography'' was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking; now forgotten series of portrait prints were enormously popular until the advent of [[photography]]: \"the importance of this series was enormous, and it provided a repertory of images that were plundered by portrait painters throughout Europe over the next couple of centuries\".{{sfn|Cust|1899}} Van Dyck's brilliant etching style, which depended on open lines and dots, was in marked contrast to that of the other great portraitist in prints of the period, [[Rembrandt]], and had little influence until the 19th century, when it had a great influence on artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in the last major phase of portrait etching.<ref name=\"Hind\" /> [[Hyatt Mayor]] wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Etchers have studied Van Dyck ever since, for they can hope to approximate his brilliant directness, whereas nobody can hope to approach the complexity of Rembrandt's portraits.<ref>Mayor, Alpheus Hyatt.

According to a visitor he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. The costume in which the client wished to be painted was left at the studio and often with the unfinished canvas sent out to artists specialised in rendering such clothing.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline in the quality of work.<ref>Brown, pp. 84-6.</ref>\n\nIn addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters. The number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among [[art historian]]s on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated ([[English country houses|country house]] attributions may be more dubious in some cases).\n\nThe relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish.

Originally \"van Dijck\", with the [[IJ (digraph)|\"IJ\" digraph]], in Dutch. Anthony is the English for the Dutch Anthonis or Antoon, though Anthonie, Antonio or Anthonio was also used; in French he is often Antoine, in Italian Anthonio or Antonio. In English a capitalised \"Van\" in Van Dyck was more usual until recent decades (used by Waterhouse for example), and \"Dyke\" was often used during his lifetime and later (and is usual for the beard style).</ref> 22 March 1599&nbsp;\u2013 9 December 1641) was a [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque artist]] who became the leading [[court painter]] in England after success in the [[Southern Netherlands]] and Italy.\n\nThe seventh child of Frans van Dyck, a wealthy [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]] silk merchant, Anthony painted from an early age. He was successful as an independent painter his late teens, and became a master in the [[Guild of Saint Luke|Antwerp guild]] in 1618. By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who became a major influence on his work.  Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired ''Iconography'' series of portrait [[etching]]s, mostly of other artists.  He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632 he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of [[Charles I of England]].\n\nWith the exception of [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], van Dyck and his contemporary [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. He is best known for his portraits of the aristocracy, most notably Charles I, and his family and associates. Van Dyck became the dominant influence on [[English school of painting|English portrait-painting]] for the next 150 years. He also painted [[mythological]] and [[biblical]] subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in [[watercolour]] and [[etching]].  His superb brushwork, apparently rather quickly painted, can usually be distinguished from the large areas painted by his many assistants.  His portrait style changed considerably between the different countries he worked in, culminating in the relaxed elegance of his last English period.  His influence extends into the modern period. The [[Van Dyke beard]] is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]], and he was buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], an indication of his standing at the time of his death.\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 008b.jpg|thumb|left|''Self-portrait'', 1613\u201314]]\n\n===Education===\nAntoon van Dyck (his Flemish name) was born to prosperous parents in Antwerp.

His influence on the young artist was immense. Rubens referred to the nineteen-year-old van Dyck as \"the best of my pupils\".<ref>Brown, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe origins and exact nature of their relationship are unclear. It has been speculated that van Dyck was a pupil of Rubens from about 1613, as even his early work shows little trace of van Balen's style, but there is no clear evidence for this.<ref name=\"EW\">Ellis Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530-1790'', 4th Edn, 1978, pp. 70-77, Penguin Books (now Yale History of Art series)</ref> At the same time the dominance of Rubens in the relatively small and declining city of Antwerp probably explains why, despite his periodic returns to the city, van Dyck spent most of his career abroad.<ref name=\"EW\" /> In 1620, in Rubens's contract for the major commission for the ceiling of the [[Carolus Borromeuskerk]], the [[Jesuit]] church at Antwerp (lost to fire in 1718), van Dyck is specified as one of the \"discipelen\" who was to execute the paintings to Rubens' designs.<ref name=\"Martin, op and page cit\">Martin, op and page cit.</ref> Unlike van Dyck, Rubens worked for most of the courts of Europe, but avoided exclusive attachment to any of them.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 012.jpg|thumb|Genoan hauteur from the Lomellini family, 1623]]\nIn 1620, at the instigation of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham]], van Dyck went to England for the first time where he worked for King [[James I of England]], receiving \u00a3100.<ref name=\"EW\" /> It was in [[London]] in the collection of the [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel|Earl of Arundel]] that he first saw the work of [[Titian]], whose use of colour and subtle modeling of form would prove transformational, offering a new stylistic language that would enrich the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.<ref>Brown, page 19.</ref>\n\nAfter about four months, he returned to Flanders, but left in late 1621 for Italy, where he remained for six years. There he studied the Italian masters while starting his career as a successful portraitist. He was already presenting himself as a figure of consequence, annoying the rather bohemian Northern artist's colony in [[Rome]], says [[Giovan Pietro Bellori]], by appearing with \"the pomp of [[Zeuxis]] ... his behaviour was that of a nobleman rather than an ordinary person, and he shone in rich garments. Since he was accustomed in the circle of Rubens to noblemen, and being naturally of elevated mind, and anxious to make himself distinguished, he therefore wore\u2014as well as silks\u2014a hat with feathers and brooches, gold chains across his chest, and was accompanied by servants.\"<ref>[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''Painting at Court'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1971, pp. 124-5</ref>\n[[File:Anthony Van Dyck, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|225px|left|''Anthony van Dyck'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1627\u201328)]]\nHe was mostly based in [[Genoa]], although he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed for some time in [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]], where he was quarantined during the 1624 plague, one of the worst in Sicily's history. There he produced an important series of paintings of the city's plague saint [[Saint Rosalia]]. His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward and was extremely influential for Italian Baroque painters, from [[Luca Giordano]] to [[Pietro Novelli]]. Versions include those in [[Saint Rosalia (Anthony van Dyck)|Madrid]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Houston)|Houston]], [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (London)|London]], [[Saint Rosalie Interceding for the Plague\u2013Stricken of Palermo|New York]] and [[Saint Rosalia Crowned by Angels (Palermo)|Palermo]], as well as [[Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo]] in Puerto Rico, and [[Coronation of Saint Rosalia]] in Vienna. Van Dyck's series of St Rosalia paintings have been studied by [[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]] and [[Xavier F. Salomon]], both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/arts/design/desperately-painting-the-plague.html</ref><ref>https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA284449813&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00036536&p=AONE&sw=w</ref><ref>https://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/about/exhibitions-archive/exhibitions-archive-by-date/2012-van-dyck-in-sicily/</ref> Recently the New York Times published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of the [[Covid-19]] virus.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/arts/design/van-dyck-metropolitan-museum-virus.html</ref>.\n\nFor the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures look down on the viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of [[Brussels]] he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630, he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large [[altarpiece]]s, and began his printmaking.\n\n===London===\n[[File:Sir-Anthony-van-Dyck-Lord-John-Stuart-and-His-Brother-Lord-Bernard-Stuart.jpg|thumb|''[[Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart]]'', c. 1638, exemplifies the more intimate, but still elegant style he developed in England]]\nKing Charles I was the most passionate collector of art among the [[House of Stuart|Stuart kings]], and saw painting as a way of promoting his elevated view of the monarchy. In 1628, he bought the fabulous collection that the [[Charles I, Duke of Mantua|Duke of Mantua]] was forced to sell, and he had been trying since his accession in 1625 to bring leading foreign painters to England. In 1626, he was able to persuade [[Orazio Gentileschi]] to settle in England, later to be joined by his daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi|Artemisia]] and some of his sons. Rubens was an especial target, who eventually in 1630 came on a diplomatic mission, which included painting, and he later sent Charles more paintings from Antwerp. Rubens was very well-treated during his nine-month visit, during which he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. Charles's court portraitist, [[Daniel Mytens]], was a somewhat pedestrian Dutchman. Charles was very short, less than {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, and presented challenges to a portrait artist.\n\nVan Dyck had remained in touch with the English court and helped King Charles's agents in their search for pictures. He sent some of his own works, including a self portrait (1623) with [[Endymion Porter]], one of Charles's agents ''Rinaldo and [[Armida]]'' (1629), and a religious picture for the Queen. He had also painted Charles's sister, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia]], at [[The Hague]] in 1632. In April of that year, van Dyck returned to London and was taken under the wing of the court immediately, being knighted in July and at the same time receiving a pension of \u00a3200 a year, in the grant of which he was described as ''[[Principal Painter in Ordinary|principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties]]''.<ref name=\"Grosvenor Gallery Stephens 1887 p. 14\">{{cite book |author=Grosvenor Gallery |last2=Stephens |first2=F.G. |title=Exhibition of the Works of Sir Anthony Van Dyck |publisher=H.

He was provided with a house on the [[River Thames]] at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the [[City of London|City]], thus avoiding the monopoly of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. A suite of rooms in [[Eltham Palace]], no longer used by the royal family, was also put at his disposal as a country retreat. His Blackfriars studio was frequently visited by the King and Queen (later a special causeway was built to ease their access), who hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived.<ref name=\"EW\" />{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 044.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Charles I at the Hunt]]'', c. 1635, Louvre]]\nHe was an immediate success in England, rapidly painting a large number of portraits of the King and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], as well as their children. Many portraits were done in several versions, to be sent as diplomatic gifts or given to supporters of the increasingly embattled king. Altogether van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of the Queen, nine of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]], and multiple ones of other courtiers.<ref>Gaunt, William, ''English Court Painting''</ref> He painted many of the court, and also himself and his mistress, Margaret Lemon.\n\nIn England he developed a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting to the end of the 18th century. Many of these portraits have a lush landscape background. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian's Emperor Charles V, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the [[Louvre]]: \"Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King\".<ref>Levey p. 128</ref> Although his portraits have created the classic idea of \"[[Cavalier]]\" style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as [[Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton|Lord Wharton]] and the Earls of [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland|Northumberland]] and [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], took the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] side in the [[English Civil War]] that broke out soon after his death.{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n[[File:Anton Van Dyck - Christ carrying the Cross - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Christ carrying the Cross'']]\nThe King [[Queen in Council|in]] [[Privy Council of England|Council]] by [[letters patent]] granted van Dyck ''[[denization|denizenship]]'' in 1638, and he married Mary, the daughter of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie#Family|Patrick Ruthven]], who, although the title was forfeited, styled himself [[Earl of Gowrie#Lords Ruthven (1488)|Lord Ruthven]].<ref>Cokayne, G.

''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web.</ref> In November, van Dyck's condition worsened, and he returned to England from Paris, where he had gone to paint [[Cardinal Richelieu]].<ref name=\"Jaffe\" /> He died in London on 9 December 1641.\n\n==Portraits and other works==\n[[File:Anton van Dyck - Samson and Delilah - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''Samson and Delilah'', c. 1630, a history painting in the manner of Rubens. The use of saturated colours reveals van Dyck's study of [[Titian]]]]\n[[File:Anthonis van Dyck 013.jpg|thumb|''[[Henrietta Maria]] and the [[dwarfism|dwarf]], [[Sir Jeffrey Hudson]]'', 1633]]\n\nIn the 17th century, demand for portraits was stronger than for other types of work. Van Dyck tried to persuade Charles to commission large-scale series on the history of the [[Order of the Garter]] for the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]], for which Rubens had earlier done the huge ceiling paintings (sending them from Antwerp). A sketch for one wall remains, but by 1638 Charles was too short of money to proceed.<ref name=\"EW\" /> This was a problem Vel\u00e1zquez did not have, but equally van Dyck's daily life was not encumbered by trivial court duties as Vel\u00e1zquez's was. In his visits to Paris in his last years van Dyck tried to obtain the commission to paint the Grande Gallerie of the [[Louvre]] without success.<ref>Levey, op cit p. 136</ref>\n\nA list of history paintings produced by van Dyck in England survives. It was compiled by van Dyck's biographer Bellori, based on information from [[Sir Kenelm Digby]].  None of these works appear to remain, except the ''Eros and Psyche'' done for the King (below).<ref name=\"EW\" /> But many other works, rather more religious than mythological, do survive, and though they are very fine, they do not reach the heights of Vel\u00e1zquez's history paintings. Earlier ones remain very much within the style of Rubens, although some of his Sicilian works are individualistic.\n\nVan Dyck's portraits flattered more than Vel\u00e1zquez's. When [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover]], first met Queen Henrietta Maria, in exile in Holland in 1641, she wrote: \"Van Dyck's handsome portraits had given me so fine an idea of the beauty of all English ladies, that I was surprised to find that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth...\"<ref name=\"EW\" />\n[[File:The Cheeke Sisters by Van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|''The Cheeke Sisters'', a late double portrait]]\nSome critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition\u2014of painters such as [[William Dobson]], [[Robert Walker (painter)|Robert Walker]] and [[Isaac Fuller]]\u2014into what certainly became elegant blandness in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, like [[Peter Lely|Lely]] or [[Godfrey Kneller|Kneller]].<ref name=\"EW\" /> The conventional view has always been more favourable: \"When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art\" (Jonathan Richardson: ''An Essay on the Theory of Painting'', 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed \"We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company.\"{{sfn|Cust|1899}}\n\nA fairly small number of [[Landscape art|landscape]] pen and wash drawings or [[watercolour]]s made in England played an important part in introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.<ref>Royalton-Kisch, Martin. ''The Light of Nature, Landscape Drawings and Watercolours by Van Dyck and his Contemporaries'', British Museum Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7141-2621-7}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Printmaking==\nProbably during his period in Antwerp after his return from Italy, van Dyck began his ''Iconography'', eventually a very large series of [[old master print|prints]] with half-length portraits of eminent contemporaries. Van Dyck produced drawings, and for eighteen of the portraits he himself [[etching|etched]] with great brilliance the heads and the main outlines of the figure, for an [[engraving|engraver]] to work up: \"Portrait etching had scarcely had an existence before his time, and in his work it suddenly appears at the highest point ever reached in the art\".<ref name=\"Hind\">Arthur M. Hind, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bxFb8nN_wUQC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false A History of Engraving and Etching]'', p. 165, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1923 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20954-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Van Dyck Pieter Brueghel the Younger.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] from the ''Iconography''; etching by van Dyck]]\nHowever, for most of the series he left the whole [[printmaking]] work to specialists, who mostly engraved everything after his drawings. His own etched plates appear not to have been published commercially until after his death, and early states are very rare.<ref name=\"Decker\">Becker, D. P., in KL Spangeberg (ed), ''Six Centuries of Master Prints'', Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, no. 72, {{ISBN|0-931537-15-0}}</ref> Most of his plates were printed after only his work had been done. Some exist in further [[state (printmaking)|states]] after engraving had been added, sometimes obscuring his etching. He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added [[Inigo Jones]] whilst in London.\n\nThe series was a great success, but was his only venture into printmaking; portraiture probably paid better, and he was constantly in demand. At his death there were eighty plates by others, of which fifty-two were of artists, as well as his own eighteen. The plates were bought by a publisher; with the plates reworked periodically as they wore out they continued to be printed for centuries, and the series added to, so that it reached over two hundred portraits by the late 18th century. In 1851, the plates were bought by the ''Calcographie du [[Louvre]]''.<ref name=\"Decker\" />\n\nThe ''Iconography'' was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking; now forgotten series of portrait prints were enormously popular until the advent of [[photography]]: \"the importance of this series was enormous, and it provided a repertory of images that were plundered by portrait painters throughout Europe over the next couple of centuries\".{{sfn|Cust|1899}} Van Dyck's brilliant etching style, which depended on open lines and dots, was in marked contrast to that of the other great portraitist in prints of the period, [[Rembrandt]], and had little influence until the 19th century, when it had a great influence on artists such as [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in the last major phase of portrait etching.<ref name=\"Hind\" /> [[Hyatt Mayor]] wrote:\n\n{{Quote|Etchers have studied Van Dyck ever since, for they can hope to approximate his brilliant directness, whereas nobody can hope to approach the complexity of Rembrandt's portraits.<ref>Mayor, Alpheus Hyatt.

Princeton, 1971, no. 433-35, {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}</ref>}}\n\n==Studio==\nVan Dyck's success led him to maintain a large workshop in London, which became \"virtually a production line for portraits\". According to a visitor he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. The costume in which the client wished to be painted was left at the studio and often with the unfinished canvas sent out to artists specialised in rendering such clothing.{{sfn|Cust|1899}} In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline in the quality of work.<ref>Brown, pp. 84-6.</ref>\n\nIn addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters. The number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among [[art historian]]s on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated ([[English country houses|country house]] attributions may be more dubious in some cases).\n\nThe relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish. He probably preferred to use trained Flemings, as no equivalent English training existed in this period.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Van Dyck's enormous influence on English art does not come from a tradition handed down through his pupils; in fact it is not possible to document a connection to his studio for any English painter of any significance.<ref name=\"EW\" /> Dutchman [[Adriaen Hanneman]] (1604\u20131671) returned to his native [[Den Haag|The Hague]] in 1638 to become the leading portraitist there.<ref>Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), ''Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals'', Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p. 138 QB, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-85709-362-9}}</ref> Flemish painter [[Pieter Thijs]] studied in van Dyck's workshop as one of van Dyck's last pupils.
