For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination. To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a considerable talent, developed through iron discipline.<ref name=\"rlc\">Roger L.

She herself used '''Sophie Kowalevski''' (or occasionally '''Kowalevsky''') in her academic publications.\n\n==Background and early education==\nSofya Kovalevskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Palibino, his family estate in [[Vitebsk Region]] in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian\u2013Polish descent (Polish on his father's side), with possible partial ancestry from the [[Hunyadi family|royal Corvin family of Hungary]], and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry on the father's side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women mathematicians|author=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|publisher=JOC/EFR|accessdate=June 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183749/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|author-link=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin}}</ref>)\n\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great grandfather was the astronomer and geographer [[Theodor von Schubert|Friedrich Theodor Schubert]] (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General [[Friedrich von Schubert|Theodor Friedrich von Schubert]] (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\n\nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. \nWhen she was 8 or 9 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by [[Mikhail Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], left over from her father's student days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172506/http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref> \nShe was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\n\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual\naptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions\nwhich she had not yet encountered in her studies.<ref>F.

During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her [[Anne Jaclard|sister Anna]] to progressive ideas influenced by the \"[[Narodniks|Movement of the 1860's]]\", providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing [[nihilism#Russian nihilist movement|nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P.

For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.<ref name=\"ahk2\">Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} }}\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of [[Charles Darwin]] in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, ''The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya'', Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the [[University of Heidelberg]].  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|87\u201389}}  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\n\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref>   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top|Kovalevskaya top]]\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\n\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with [[Karl Weierstrass]], since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\n\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the [[Paris Commune]], where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|104\u2013106}} With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband [[Victor Jaclard]], who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save [[Victor Jaclard]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|107\u2013108}}\n\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on [[partial differential equation]]s, on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]], and on [[elliptic integral]]s\u2014to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate at a European university. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem]], which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\n\n==L\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship.<ref>McFadden, Margaret. ''Golden Cables of Sympathy: The Transatlantic Sources of Nineteenth-Century Feminism.'' University Press of Kentucky, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of [[Acta Mathematica]]. In 1888 she won the ''Prix Bordin'' of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".<ref name=RCooke/><ref>Sof\u02b9ja Vasil\u02b9evna Kovalevskaja, ''[https://books.google.ca/books/about/M%C3%A9moire_sur_un_cas_particulier_du_probl.html?id=8r72rQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide de fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps]'', IMprimerie nationale, 1894</ref> Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"[[Kovalevskaya top]]\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of [[rigid body]] motion that is \"completely [[integrable systems|integrable]]\" other than the tops of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]].<ref name=cooke>{{Cite book| last = Cooke | first = Roger | title = The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya  | publisher = Springer | year = 1984 | page = 159| isbn = 9781461297666}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|218}} After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\n\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the vibrant, politically progressive and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, ''A Russian Childhood'', two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, ''Nihilist Girl'' (1890).\n\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with [[Maksim Kovalevsky|Maxim Kovalevsky]], a distant relation of her deceased husband,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638145|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=251|oclc=41497065}}</ref> but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.<ref name=\"rlc\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nKovalevskaya died of [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic|influenza]] complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|231}} She is buried in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], Sweden, at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].\n\nKovalevskaya's mathematical results, such as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem]], and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz,<ref name=\"ahk1\"/> a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina<ref>P.

She herself used '''Sophie Kowalevski''' (or occasionally '''Kowalevsky''') in her academic publications.\n\n==Background and early education==\nSofya Kovalevskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Palibino, his family estate in [[Vitebsk Region]] in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian\u2013Polish descent (Polish on his father's side), with possible partial ancestry from the [[Hunyadi family|royal Corvin family of Hungary]], and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry on the father's side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women mathematicians|author=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|publisher=JOC/EFR|accessdate=June 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183749/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|author-link=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin}}</ref>)\n\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great grandfather was the astronomer and geographer [[Theodor von Schubert|Friedrich Theodor Schubert]] (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General [[Friedrich von Schubert|Theodor Friedrich von Schubert]] (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\n\nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. \nWhen she was 8 or 9 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by [[Mikhail Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], left over from her father's student days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172506/http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref> \nShe was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\n\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual\naptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions\nwhich she had not yet encountered in her studies.<ref>F.

During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her [[Anne Jaclard|sister Anna]] to progressive ideas influenced by the \"[[Narodniks|Movement of the 1860's]]\", providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing [[nihilism#Russian nihilist movement|nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P.

For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.<ref name=\"ahk2\">Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} }}\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of [[Charles Darwin]] in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, ''The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya'', Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the [[University of Heidelberg]].  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|87\u201389}}  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\n\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref>   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top|Kovalevskaya top]]\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\n\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with [[Karl Weierstrass]], since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\n\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the [[Paris Commune]], where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|104\u2013106}} With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband [[Victor Jaclard]], who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save [[Victor Jaclard]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|107\u2013108}}\n\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on [[partial differential equation]]s, on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]], and on [[elliptic integral]]s\u2014to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate at a European university. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem]], which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\n\n==Last years in Germany and Sweden==\n[[File:Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya Bust.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust by Finnish sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]]]]\n[[Image:Sofia Kovalevskaya grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kovalevskaya's grave, [[Norra begravningsplatsen]]]]\n\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her gender.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kochina|first=Pelageya|title=Love and Mathematics: Sofia Kovalevskaya|year=1985|publisher=Mir Publisher|location=Moscow}}</ref><ref name=\"ahk1\"/>\n\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\n\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship.<ref>McFadden, Margaret. ''Golden Cables of Sympathy: The Transatlantic Sources of Nineteenth-Century Feminism.''

In 1888 she won the ''Prix Bordin'' of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".<ref name=RCooke/><ref>Sof\u02b9ja Vasil\u02b9evna Kovalevskaja, ''[https://books.google.ca/books/about/M%C3%A9moire_sur_un_cas_particulier_du_probl.html?id=8r72rQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide de fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps]'', IMprimerie nationale, 1894</ref> Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"[[Kovalevskaya top]]\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of [[rigid body]] motion that is \"completely [[integrable systems|integrable]]\" other than the tops of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]].<ref name=cooke>{{Cite book| last = Cooke | first = Roger | title = The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya  | publisher = Springer | year = 1984 | page = 159| isbn = 9781461297666}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|218}} After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\n\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the vibrant, politically progressive and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, ''A Russian Childhood'', two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, ''Nihilist Girl'' (1890).\n\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with [[Maksim Kovalevsky|Maxim Kovalevsky]], a distant relation of her deceased husband,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638145|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=251|oclc=41497065}}</ref> but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.<ref name=\"rlc\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nKovalevskaya died of [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic|influenza]] complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|231}} She is buried in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], Sweden, at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].\n\nKovalevskaya's mathematical results, such as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem]], and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz,<ref name=\"ahk1\"/> a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina<ref>P.

The United States government determined that somewhere between 200,000 and 500,000 Americans were then homeless.<ref>Joint Hearing op. cit., May 1984, p. 32 IUD Office for Policy Development and Research, A Report to the Secretary on the Homeless and Emergency Shelters, May 1, 1986.</ref> There were some U.S. federal initiatives that aimed to help, end and prevent homelessness; however, there were no designated homeless-related programs in the Office of Management and Budget.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.usich.gov/funding_programs/programs/ |title = Programs &#124; Funding & Programs &#124; United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) |publisher = Usich.gov |accessdate = August 1, 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130802011016/http://www.usich.gov/funding_programs/programs |archivedate = August 2, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[History of the United States (1980\u20131991)|history of the United States]] illustrates that this was a time when there was economic distress, high unemployment, and was the period when chronic homelessness became a societal problem. In 1980, federal funds accounted for 22% of big city budgets, but by 1989 the similar aid composed only 6% of urban revenue (part of a larger 60% decrease in federal spending to support local governments).<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\">Common Dreams: [http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0610-01.htm Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516100105/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0610-01.htm |date=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> It is largely (although not exclusively) in these urban areas that homelessness became widespread and reached unprecedented numbers. Most notable were cuts to federal low-income housing programs. An advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for [[public housing]] and [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (the government's housing voucher subsidization program) and that between the years of 1980 and 1989 HUD's budget authority was reduced from $74 billion to $19 billion.<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\"/> Such alleged changes are claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of [[affordable housing]] to meet the growing demand of low-income populations. In 1970 there were 300,000 more low-cost rental units (6.5 million) than low-income renter households (6.2 million). By 1985, the advocacy group claimed that the number of low-cost units had fallen to 5.6 million, and the number of low-income renter households had grown to 8.9 million, a disparity of 3.3 million units.<ref>National Housing Institute: [http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html Reagan's Legacy: Homelessness in America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027055709/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html |date=October 27, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s and after many years of advocacy and numerous revisions, President Reagan signed into law the [[McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] in 1987; this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people. The McKinney\u2013Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the coming years. During the 1990s [[homeless shelters]], [[soup kitchens]], and other supportive services sprouted up in cities and towns across the nation. However, despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth marked by this decade, homeless numbers remained stubbornly high.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} It became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to alleviate the symptoms of homelessness (i.e. shelter beds, hot meals, psychiatric counseling, etc.), although needed, were not successful at solving the root causes of homelessness. The [[United States Interagency Council on Homelessness]] (USICH), a federal agency contained in the Executive Branch, was established in 1987 as a requirement of the McKinney\u2013Vento Act of 1987.\n\nA 1990 survey found that most literally homeless people were unable to bathe or shower.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/h0079653|pmid = 7485420|title = Lifetime and five-year prevalence of homelessness in the United States: New evidence on an old debate|journal = American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|volume = 65|issue = 3|pages = 347\u2013354|year = 1995|last1 = Link|first1 = Bruce|last2 = Phelan|first2 = Jo|last3 = Bresnahan|first3 = Michaeline|last4 = Stueve|first4 = Ann|last5 = Moore|first5 = Robert|last6 = Susser|first6 = Ezra}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n{{See also|Great Recession in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Homeless Veteran in New York.jpeg|thumb|right|Homeless veteran in New York]]\n\n==== Improved data ====\n\nOver the past decades, the availability and quality of data on homelessness has improved considerably, due, in part, to initiatives by the United States government. Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report, which revealed the number of individuals and families that were homeless, both sheltered and unsheltered.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = Huduser.org |title = First Annual Homelessness Assessment Report |url = http://www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/ahar.pdf}}</ref> In 2009, there were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide. About two-thirds of those stayed in emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs, with the remaining living on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.<ref name=\"hudd\">{{cite web |url = http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/5thHomelessAssessmentReport.pdf |title = HUD 5th Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress |date = June 2010 |website = Huduser.org |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> Around 44% of homeless people were employed.<ref>[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/employment.html Employment and Homelessness].

More than 40 percent of sheltered homeless people have a disability. At the same time, sizable segments of the sheltered homeless population are white, non-Hispanic (38 percent), children (20 percent), or part of multi-person households (33 percent). Approximately 68 percent of the 1.6 million sheltered homeless people were homeless as individuals and 32 percent were persons in families.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, [http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/povsoc/ahar_4.html \"The Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (2008)\"], July 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2008 more than 66 percent of all sheltered homeless people were located in principal cities, with 32 percent located in suburban or rural jurisdictions. About 40 percent of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation (sheltered or unsheltered), 40 percent came from a housed situation (in their own or someone else's home), and the remaining 20 percent were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters: 60 percent stayed less than a month, and a 33 percent stayed a week or less.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\"/>\n\n==== Causes ====\nLack of affordable housing as a cause of homelessness was named by most of the mayors in 2004 when the United States Conference of Mayors surveyed the mayors of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness. The next three causes identified by mayors, in rank order, were mental illness or the lack of needed services, substance abuse and lack of needed services, and low-paying jobs. The lowest ranking cause, cited by five mayors, was [[prisoner reentry]]. Other causes cited were unemployment, domestic violence, and poverty.\n\nThe major causes of homelessness include:<ref name=\"USConferenceMayors2001\">[[United States Conference of Mayors]], \"A Status Report on Hunger and Homelessness in America's Cities: a 27-city survey\", December 2001.</ref><ref name=\"USConferenceMayors2005\">{{cite web |url = http://www.usmayors.org/hungersurvey/2005/HH2005FINAL.pdf |title = A Status Report on Hunger and Homelessness in America's Cities |date = December 2005 |pages = 63\u201364 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081230172249/http://www.usmayors.org/hungersurvey/2005/HH2005FINAL.pdf |archivedate = December 30, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Survey Cities Say Lack of Federal Commitment to Hurricane Evacuees Will Strain Local Limited Resources |url=http://www.mayors.org/uscm/news/press_releases/documents/hh2005_121905.pdf {{small|(62.3 KB)}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213151517/http://mayors.org/uscm/news/press_releases/documents/hh2005_121905.pdf |archivedate=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sodexhousa.com/press-releases/pr122005.asp |title = Survey Cities Say Lack of Federal Commitment to Hurricane Evacuees Will Strain Local Limited Resources |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061112124120/http://www.sodexhousa.com/press-releases/pr122005.asp |archivedate = November 12, 2006 |accessdate = December 21, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Main Causes of Homelessness\">Vanneman, Reeve, [http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/socy498/causes.html \"Main Causes of Homelessness\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822233332/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/socy/vanneman/socy498/causes.html |date=August 22, 2009 }}, University of Maryland</ref><ref name=\"Koegel1\">Cf.

Although many medical, psychiatric, and counseling services exist to address these needs, it is commonly believed that without the support of reliable and stable housing such treatments remain ineffective. Furthermore, in the absence of a [[universal healthcare]] plan, many of those in need cannot afford such services. Proposed legislation such as the [[Bringing America Home Act]] are intended to provide comprehensive treatment for many homeless mental and substance abuse patients.\n\n=== Policies ===\n{{USgovtPOV|section|date=August 2017}}\nThere are several policies dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the government decided to start sending funding to people that are homeless, but it was not until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} As it was shown though seventy percent required homeless people to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there. In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem. Later on, the ''No Child Left Behind Act'' of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (NAEH) in 2000. The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. \n\nIn 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made \"ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective.\" The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The \"Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/odep/programs/homeless.htm |title = U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 ODEP \u2013 Office of Disability Employment Policy \u2013 Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing Projects |publisher = Dol.gov |date = September 29, 2003 |accessdate = August 1, 2013 }}</ref> initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hud.gov/ |title = Locating New Page |website = Hud.gov|accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> and the Department of Labor (DOL).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/ |title = United States Department of Labor |website = Dol.gov |date = March 23, 2017 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> The initiative offered $10 million from HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8 is the core housing program that helps extremely low-income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community. The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the number of vouchers granted to the population of people that are homeless.\n\n=== Public libraries ===\n\nPublic libraries can and often do significantly assist with the issues presented by homelessness. In many communities, the library is the only facility that offers free computer and internet access, so this is where many people experiencing homelessness go to locate services for basic needs such as healthcare, education, and housing. Libraries computers are also necessary for building a resume, searching for open jobs in the area, and completing job applications.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/nashville-library-homeless_n_6746162.html |title = How Libraries Are Adapting To Help Homeless Find Jobs, Health Services |work = The Huffington Post |date = February 24, 2015 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe news article and video entitled, \"SF library offers Social Services to Homeless,\"<ref>{{cite web |last = Tyler |first = Carolyn |url = http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&id=7459632 |title = San Francisco library offers social services to homeless &#124; abc7news.com |website = Abclocal.go.com |date = May 24, 2010 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> speaks about the San Francisco library having a full-time social worker at the library to reduce and help homeless patrons.

She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight, 2010).<ref>Knight, H. (January 11, 2010).

Education of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the [[cycle of poverty]]. The McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless students. This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education. These barriers include residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation issues. Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness, while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it's the only thing that remains normal.<ref name=\"NPR\">Abramson, Larry, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95222948 \"Amid Foreclosures, A Rise In Homeless Students\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'' program, NPR, September 30, 2008.</ref> Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders, and lack of attendance in school.<ref>Nieves, Evelyn, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/WireStory?id=6497841&page=1 \"In Tough Times, Ranks of Homeless Students Rising: School districts find unprecedented increase in numbers of homeless students across US\"], Associated Press, December 19, 2008</ref>\n\nSince the [[United States housing bubble]] collapse, there has been a rise in the number of homeless students.

Due to underfunding many school districts are struggling to provide the necessary services to support homeless students, as mandated in the provisions of the McKinney\u2013Vento Act, such as rising transportation needs and the greater range and usefulness of services. [[Wisconsin Rapids]] Public Schools Homeless Liaison Heather Lisitza says:\n\n{{quote|quote=One of the biggest challenges our district faces is providing transportation to students who are experiencing homelessness. There are few approaches that our district can utilize to provide transportation for these students. Our city has only one taxi cab service and no public bus system. Our cab company is small and simply cannot fulfill all of our transportation requests. When it's possible, we add students to existing bus routes or set up a contractual agreement with the student's parent/guardian. However, there have been many situations where none of these options have worked. Another challenge our district faces is providing proper outer-wear for students who are homeless. Being that we live in central Wisconsin and have long, cold winters, all students need proper outerwear to go outside. Proper outerwear includes snow boots, hat, mittens, snow pants, and a winter jacket that has a working zipper or buttons on it. This expense adds up quickly and is hard to provide to the increasing number of homeless students.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>}}\n\nThis is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in reading; 2) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in spelling; and 3) 2.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in math.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>\nThere are a few worries that there will be false reports of homeless students, but mostly it's not an issue.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Criminalization|Criminalization of homelessness}} ===\n\nVarious laws have both directly and indirectly [[Criminalization of homelessness|criminalized people that are homeless]]<ref>[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] (August 10, 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/10/america-poverty-criminalised \"How America criminalised poverty\"] ''The Guardian''</ref> and people attempting to feed homeless people outdoors.<ref>Baylen Linnekin (June 9, 2012) [http://reason.com/archives/2012/06/09/bans-on-feeding-homeless-have-always-bee \"Bans on Feeding the Homeless Are Discriminatory and Unconstitutional\"] ''Reason.org''</ref> At least 31 cities have criminalized feeding people that are homeless.<ref>Robbie Couch (November 3, 2014).

In 1980, federal funds accounted for 22% of big city budgets, but by 1989 the similar aid composed only 6% of urban revenue (part of a larger 60% decrease in federal spending to support local governments).<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\">Common Dreams: [http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0610-01.htm Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516100105/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0610-01.htm |date=May 16, 2006 }}</ref> It is largely (although not exclusively) in these urban areas that homelessness became widespread and reached unprecedented numbers. Most notable were cuts to federal low-income housing programs. An advocacy group claims that Congress halved the budget for [[public housing]] and [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (the government's housing voucher subsidization program) and that between the years of 1980 and 1989 HUD's budget authority was reduced from $74 billion to $19 billion.<ref name=\"Urban Suffering Grew Under Reagan\"/> Such alleged changes are claimed to have resulted in an inadequate supply of [[affordable housing]] to meet the growing demand of low-income populations. In 1970 there were 300,000 more low-cost rental units (6.5 million) than low-income renter households (6.2 million). By 1985, the advocacy group claimed that the number of low-cost units had fallen to 5.6 million, and the number of low-income renter households had grown to 8.9 million, a disparity of 3.3 million units.<ref>National Housing Institute: [http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html Reagan's Legacy: Homelessness in America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027055709/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/135/reagan.html |date=October 27, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn response to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s and after many years of advocacy and numerous revisions, President Reagan signed into law the [[McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] in 1987; this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people. The McKinney\u2013Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the coming years. During the 1990s [[homeless shelters]], [[soup kitchens]], and other supportive services sprouted up in cities and towns across the nation. However, despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth marked by this decade, homeless numbers remained stubbornly high.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} It became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to alleviate the symptoms of homelessness (i.e. shelter beds, hot meals, psychiatric counseling, etc.), although needed, were not successful at solving the root causes of homelessness.

Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report, which revealed the number of individuals and families that were homeless, both sheltered and unsheltered.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = Huduser.org |title = First Annual Homelessness Assessment Report |url = http://www.huduser.org/Publications/pdf/ahar.pdf}}</ref> In 2009, there were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide. About two-thirds of those stayed in emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs, with the remaining living on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009.<ref name=\"hudd\">{{cite web |url = http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/5thHomelessAssessmentReport.pdf |title = HUD 5th Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress |date = June 2010 |website = Huduser.org |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> Around 44% of homeless people were employed.<ref>[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/employment.html Employment and Homelessness].

More than 40 percent of sheltered homeless people have a disability. At the same time, sizable segments of the sheltered homeless population are white, non-Hispanic (38 percent), children (20 percent), or part of multi-person households (33 percent). Approximately 68 percent of the 1.6 million sheltered homeless people were homeless as individuals and 32 percent were persons in families.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, [http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/povsoc/ahar_4.html \"The Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (2008)\"], July 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2008 more than 66 percent of all sheltered homeless people were located in principal cities, with 32 percent located in suburban or rural jurisdictions. About 40 percent of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation (sheltered or unsheltered), 40 percent came from a housed situation (in their own or someone else's home), and the remaining 20 percent were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters: 60 percent stayed less than a month, and a 33 percent stayed a week or less.<ref name=\"hudhre.info\"/>\n\n==== Causes ====\nLack of affordable housing as a cause of homelessness was named by most of the mayors in 2004 when the United States Conference of Mayors surveyed the mayors of major cities on the extent and causes of urban homelessness. The next three causes identified by mayors, in rank order, were mental illness or the lack of needed services, substance abuse and lack of needed services, and low-paying jobs. The lowest ranking cause, cited by five mayors, was [[prisoner reentry]].

Although many medical, psychiatric, and counseling services exist to address these needs, it is commonly believed that without the support of reliable and stable housing such treatments remain ineffective. Furthermore, in the absence of a [[universal healthcare]] plan, many of those in need cannot afford such services. Proposed legislation such as the [[Bringing America Home Act]] are intended to provide comprehensive treatment for many homeless mental and substance abuse patients.\n\n=== Policies ===\n{{USgovtPOV|section|date=August 2017}}\nThere are several policies dealing with homelessness. In 1980 the government decided to start sending funding to people that are homeless, but it was not until 1984 that shelters were built to accommodate and feed them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} As it was shown though seventy percent required homeless people to attend a religious ceremony and spend only a couple of nights there. In the 1987 McKinney Act the problem with homelessness became known as a huge social problem. Later on, the ''No Child Left Behind Act'' of 2001 (P.L. 107-110) amended the program explicitly to prohibit states that receive McKinney-Vento funds from segregating homeless students from non-homeless students, except for short periods of time for health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary, special, supplementary services. The Chronic Homelessness Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration established a national goal of ending chronic homelessness in ten years, by 2012. The idea of a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness began as a part of a 10-year plan to end homelessness in general adopted by the [[National Alliance to End Homelessness]] (NAEH) in 2000. The following year, then-Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. \n\nIn 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made \"ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective.\" The bi-partisan, congressionally mandated, Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. By 2003, the Interagency Council on Homelessness had been re-engaged and charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. The Administration has recently undertaken some collaborative efforts to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness in 10 years. On October 1, 2003, the Administration announced the award of over $48 million in grants aimed at serving the needs of the chronically homeless through two initiatives. The \"Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing\"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/odep/programs/homeless.htm |title = U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 ODEP \u2013 Office of Disability Employment Policy \u2013 Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing Projects |publisher = Dol.gov |date = September 29, 2003 |accessdate = August 1, 2013 }}</ref> initiative was a collaborative grant offered jointly by HUD<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hud.gov/ |title = Locating New Page |website = Hud.gov|accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> and the Department of Labor (DOL).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dol.gov/ |title = United States Department of Labor |website = Dol.gov |date = March 23, 2017 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> The initiative offered $10 million from HUD and $3.5 million from DOL to help the chronically homeless in five communities gain access to employment and permanent housing. Section 8 is the core housing program that helps extremely low-income families accommodate the gap between their incomes below 30 percent of the median income for each community. The government assists homeless families by awarding grants and vouchers. Vouchers are available to the families who are most needy and they are used to pay for housing found in the private market. Currently there are policy changes in who receives vouchers and there will be a reduction in the number of vouchers granted to the population of people that are homeless.\n\n=== Public libraries ===\n\nPublic libraries can and often do significantly assist with the issues presented by homelessness. In many communities, the library is the only facility that offers free computer and internet access, so this is where many people experiencing homelessness go to locate services for basic needs such as healthcare, education, and housing. Libraries computers are also necessary for building a resume, searching for open jobs in the area, and completing job applications.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/24/nashville-library-homeless_n_6746162.html |title = How Libraries Are Adapting To Help Homeless Find Jobs, Health Services |work = The Huffington Post |date = February 24, 2015 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe news article and video entitled, \"SF library offers Social Services to Homeless,\"<ref>{{cite web |last = Tyler |first = Carolyn |url = http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/assignment_7&id=7459632 |title = San Francisco library offers social services to homeless &#124; abc7news.com |website = Abclocal.go.com |date = May 24, 2010 |accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}</ref> speaks about the San Francisco library having a full-time social worker at the library to reduce and help homeless patrons.

She offers help in different forms that could range from linking patrons with services or providing them with mental health counseling. She also supervises a 12-week vocational program that culminates in gainful employment in the library for the formerly homeless (Knight, 2010).<ref>Knight, H. (January 11, 2010).

Education of homeless youth is thought to be essential in breaking the [[cycle of poverty]]. The McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates equal opportunity to a free public education to homeless students. This act is supposed to break down the barriers homeless students have to receiving an education. These barriers include residency restriction, medical record verification, and transportation issues. Once a student surpasses these barriers, they are still subject to the stigma of being homeless, and the humiliation they feel because of their situation. Some families do not report their homelessness, while others are unaware of the opportunities available to them. Many report that maintaining a stable school environment helps the students because it's the only thing that remains normal.<ref name=\"NPR\">Abramson, Larry, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95222948 \"Amid Foreclosures, A Rise In Homeless Students\"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'' program, NPR, September 30, 2008.</ref> Many homeless students fall behind their peers in school due to behavioral disorders, and lack of attendance in school.<ref>Nieves, Evelyn, [http://abcnews.go.com/US/WireStory?id=6497841&page=1 \"In Tough Times, Ranks of Homeless Students Rising: School districts find unprecedented increase in numbers of homeless students across US\"], Associated Press, December 19, 2008</ref>\n\nSince the [[United States housing bubble]] collapse, there has been a rise in the number of homeless students.

Due to underfunding many school districts are struggling to provide the necessary services to support homeless students, as mandated in the provisions of the McKinney\u2013Vento Act, such as rising transportation needs and the greater range and usefulness of services. [[Wisconsin Rapids]] Public Schools Homeless Liaison Heather Lisitza says:\n\n{{quote|quote=One of the biggest challenges our district faces is providing transportation to students who are experiencing homelessness. There are few approaches that our district can utilize to provide transportation for these students. Our city has only one taxi cab service and no public bus system. Our cab company is small and simply cannot fulfill all of our transportation requests. When it's possible, we add students to existing bus routes or set up a contractual agreement with the student's parent/guardian. However, there have been many situations where none of these options have worked. Another challenge our district faces is providing proper outer-wear for students who are homeless. Being that we live in central Wisconsin and have long, cold winters, all students need proper outerwear to go outside. Proper outerwear includes snow boots, hat, mittens, snow pants, and a winter jacket that has a working zipper or buttons on it. This expense adds up quickly and is hard to provide to the increasing number of homeless students.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>}}\n\nThis is especially worrisome since homeless students are 1) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in reading; 2) 1.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in spelling; and 3) 2.5 times more likely to perform below grade level in math.<ref name=\"NAEHCY\"/>\nThere are a few worries that there will be false reports of homeless students, but mostly it's not an issue.<ref name=\"NPR\"/>\n\n=== {{visible anchor|Criminalization|Criminalization of homelessness}} ===\n\nVarious laws have both directly and indirectly [[Criminalization of homelessness|criminalized people that are homeless]]<ref>[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] (August 10, 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/aug/10/america-poverty-criminalised \"How America criminalised poverty\"] ''The Guardian''</ref> and people attempting to feed homeless people outdoors.<ref>Baylen Linnekin (June 9, 2012) [http://reason.com/archives/2012/06/09/bans-on-feeding-homeless-have-always-bee \"Bans on Feeding the Homeless Are Discriminatory and Unconstitutional\"] ''Reason.org''</ref> At least 31 cities have criminalized feeding people that are homeless.<ref>Robbie Couch (November 3, 2014).

The NCH called those acts [[hate crime]]s (they retain the definition of the American Congress).

Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], [[Vulpecula]], and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]]. Lyra is nearly overhead in temperate northern latitudes shortly after midnight at the start of summer. From the equator to about the [[40th parallel south]] it is visible low in the northern sky during the same (thus winter) months.\n[[File:Lyra 2019-12-31.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The constellation Lyra, enhanced for color and contrast.  Brightest five stars are labeled.]]\n\n[[Vega]], Lyra's brightest star, is [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars in the night sky]], and forms a Conner of the famed [[Summer Triangle]] asterism. [[Beta Lyrae]] is the prototype of a class of [[binary star]] known as [[Beta Lyrae variable]]s. These binary stars are so close to each other that they become Lyra-shaped and material flows from one to the other. [[Epsilon Lyrae]], known informally as the  Double, is a complex multiple star system. Lyra also hosts the [[Ring Nebula]], the second-discovered and best-known [[planetary nebula]].

Made by [[Hermes]] from a [[tortoise]] shell, given to [[Apollo]] as a bargain, it was said to be the first lyre ever produced. Orpheus's music was said to be so great that even inanimate objects such as [[tree]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[rock (geology)|rock]]s could be charmed. Joining [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], his music was able to quell the voices of the dangerous [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, who sang tempting songs to the Argonauts.<ref name=\"Ridpath\"/>\n\nAt one point, Orpheus married [[Eurydice]], a nymph. While fleeing from an attack by [[Aristaeus]], she stepped on a snake that bit her, killing her. To reclaim her, Orpheus entered the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], where the music from his lyre charmed [[Hades]]. Hades relented and let Orpheus bring Eurydice back, on the condition that he never once look back until outside. Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered and looked back, causing Eurydice to be left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent the rest of his life strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.<ref name=\"Ridpath\"/>\n\nThere are two competing myths relating to the death of Orpheus. According to [[Eratosthenes]], Orpheus failed to make a necessary sacrifice to [[Dionysus]] due to his regard for [[Apollo]] as the supreme deity instead. Dionysus then sent his followers to rip Orpheus apart. [[Ovid]] tells a rather different story, saying that women, in retribution for Orpheus's rejection of marriage offers, ganged up and threw stones and [[spear]]s. At first, his music charmed them as well, but eventually their numbers and clamor overwhelmed his music and he was hit by the spears.

It is one of 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and is one of the 88 constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Lyra was often represented on star maps as a [[vulture]] or an [[eagle]] carrying a lyre, and hence is sometimes referred to as '''Vultur Cadens''' or '''Aquila Cadens''' (\"Falling Vulture\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bistue|first1=Belen|title=Collaborative Translation and Multi-Version Texts in Early Modern Europe|date=May 23, 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317164350|pages=72\u201373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nlc3DAAAQBAJ|ref=Bistue}}</ref> or \"Falling Eagle\"), respectively. Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], [[Vulpecula]], and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]]. Lyra is nearly overhead in temperate northern latitudes shortly after midnight at the start of summer. From the equator to about the [[40th parallel south]] it is visible low in the northern sky during the same (thus winter) months.\n[[File:Lyra 2019-12-31.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The constellation Lyra, enhanced for color and contrast.  Brightest five stars are labeled.]]\n\n[[Vega]], Lyra's brightest star, is [[list of brightest stars|one of the brightest stars in the night sky]], and forms a corner of the famed [[Summer Triangle]] asterism. [[Beta Lyrae]] is the prototype of a class of [[binary star]] known as [[Beta Lyrae variable]]s. These binary stars are so close to each other that they become egg-shaped and material flows from one to the other. [[Epsilon Lyrae]], known informally as the  Double, is a complex multiple star system. Lyra also hosts the [[Ring Nebula]], the second-discovered and best-known [[planetary nebula]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Lacerta, Cygnus, Lyra, Vulpecula and Anser.jpg|Lyra can be seen on the right of this c. 1825 star map from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''.|thumb|left|300px]]\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Lyra represents the [[lyre]] of [[Orpheus]]. Made by [[Hermes]] from a [[tortoise]] shell, given to [[Apollo]] as a bargain, it was said to be the first lyre ever produced. Orpheus's music was said to be so great that even inanimate objects such as [[tree]]s, [[stream]]s, and [[rock (geology)|rock]]s could be charmed. Joining [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], his music was able to quell the voices of the dangerous [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, who sang tempting songs to the Argonauts.<ref name=\"Ridpath\"/>\n\nAt one point, Orpheus married [[Eurydice]], a nymph. While fleeing from an attack by [[Aristaeus]], she stepped on a snake that bit her, killing her. To reclaim her, Orpheus entered the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], where the music from his lyre charmed [[Hades]]. Hades relented and let Orpheus bring Eurydice back, on the condition that he never once look back until outside. Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered and looked back, causing Eurydice to be left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent the rest of his life strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.<ref name=\"Ridpath\"/>\n\nThere are two competing myths relating to the death of Orpheus. According to [[Eratosthenes]], Orpheus failed to make a necessary sacrifice to [[Dionysus]] due to his regard for [[Apollo]] as the supreme deity instead. Dionysus then sent his followers to rip Orpheus apart. [[Ovid]] tells a rather different story, saying that women, in retribution for Orpheus's rejection of marriage offers, ganged up and threw stones and [[spear]]s. At first, his music charmed them as well, but eventually their numbers and clamor overwhelmed his music and he was hit by the spears.

The University organized formal Centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.bu.edu/info/about/ Boston University |Visitor Center | About the University |History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216154448/http://www.bu.edu/info/about/ |date=February 16, 2006 }}, retrieved May 6, 2006</ref> One or the other, or both dates may appear on various official seals used by different schools of the university.\n\nOn April 24\u201325, 1839 a group of [[Methodist]] ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school. Set up in Newbury, [[Vermont]], the school was named the \"Newbury Biblical Institute\".\n\nIn 1847, the Congregational Society in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], invited the Institute to relocate to Concord and offered a disused [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational church]] building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by New Hampshire designated the school the \"Methodist General Biblical Institute\", but it was commonly called the \"Concord Biblical Institute\".\n\nWith the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased {{convert|30|acre|m2}} on Aspinwall Hill in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], as a possible relocation site. The institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood of Boston, and received a Massachusetts Charter as the \"Boston Theological Seminary\".\n\nIn 1869, three trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by name of \"Boston University\". These trustees were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises, and they became the founders of Boston University. They were Isaac Rich (1801\u20131872), Lee Claflin (1791\u20131871), and Jacob Sleeper (1802\u20131889), for whom Boston University's three [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]] dormitories were later named. Lee Claflin's son, [[William Claflin|William]], was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on May 26, 1869 after it was passed by the Legislature.\n\nAs reported by Kathleen Kilgore in her book, ''Transformations, A History of Boston University'' (see [[Boston University#Further reading|Further reading]]), the founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:\n\n:No instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission... on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.\n\nEvery department of the new university was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.\n\n===Early years (1870\u20131900)===\n[[File:Bell receives honorary LL.D from University of Edinburgh.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Alexander Graham Bell]], who invented the telephone at Boston University]]\n[[File:688 Boylston St.jpg|thumbnail|right|688 Boylston Street, the early home of the College of Liberal Arts, the precursor to the College of Arts & Sciences]]\nThe Boston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the [[Boston University School of Theology|BU School of Theology]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/sth/welcome/about-sth/history/|title=history \u00bb School of Theology|publisher=Boston University|language=en|access-date=October 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016230033/https://www.bu.edu/sth/welcome/about-sth/history/|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1872, [[Isaac Rich]] died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university as of that time. By December, however, the [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the University, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were [[bankrupt]]. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAs a result, the University was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill, and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of University ownership in this area. Following the fire, Boston University established its new facilities in buildings scattered throughout [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] and later expanded into the [[Boylston Street]] and [[Copley Square]] area before building its Charles River Campus in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAfter receiving a year's salary advance to allow him to pursue his research in 1875, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], then a professor at the school, invented the telephone in a Boston University laboratory.<ref name=\"Kilgore\">{{cite book |last1=Kilgore|first1=Kathleen|title=Transformations: A History of Boston University|date=1991|publisher=Boston University Press |location=Boston}}</ref> In 1876, [[Borden Parker Bowne]] was appointed professor of philosophy.

The trustees approved the firing of student managers and clamped down on programming and editorial policy, which had been led by Jim Thistle, later a major force in Boston's broadcast news milieu. The on-campus political dispute between Case's conservative administration and the suddenly active and mostly liberal student body led to other disputes over BU student print publications, such as the ''B.U. News'' and the ''Scarlet'', a fraternity association newspaper.\n\nThe Presidency of [[John Silber]] also saw much expansion of the campus and programs. In the late 1970s, the [[Lahey Clinic]] vacated its building at 605 Commonwealth Avenue and moved to [[Burlington, Massachusetts]].

One overriding goal has been to break down the barriers between the University's 17 schools and colleges that had evolved over the decades and find ways to combine different fields and researchers within interdisciplinary research centers. This philosophy of creating new knowledge from a variety of corners of the University extends to undergraduate education, as well, which has been overhauled to expose students to new fields and ways of thinking and problem solving. This includes requiring course work outside their majors, development of personal communications skills, and cross-school collaborations.

The campus has seen the addition of a 26-floor student residence at 33 Harry Agganis Way, nicknamed StuVi2, the New Balance Playing Field, the Yawkey Center for Student Services, the Alan and Sherry Leventhal Center, the Law tower and Redstone annex, the Engineering Product Innovation Center (EPIC), the Center for Integrated Life Sciences & Engineering (CILSE), and the Joan and Edgar Booth Theatre, scheduled to open in fall 2017. The Dahod Family Alumni Center in the renovated BU Castle will begin in May 2017.

The [[Boston University Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]] into [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] represents the dividing line between Main Campus, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]], home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex.\n\nThe main campus buildings of BU are separated from the [[Charles River Esplanade]] parkland and the [[Paul Dudley White]] Bike Path along the banks of the nearby Charles River, by heavily trafficked [[Storrow Drive]], a high-speed [[limited-access road|limited-access]] major roadway connecting downtown Boston to its western suburbs. The separation occurred in the late 1920s, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seized land by [[eminent domain]] for the construction of the new roadway along the riverbank. A narrow strip of grassy lawn between BU academic buildings lining Commonwealth Avenue and the torrent of traffic on Storrow Drive has been humorously dubbed \"BU Beach\", because it is a favorite hangout for [[sunbathing]] in good weather. The lounging students are protected from traffic incursions by a raised earthen [[berm]], which also muffles the traffic noise to a dull roar. To protect pedestrians from vehicular collisions, Storrow Drive is enclosed by fencing, with [[pedestrian bridge]]s allowing safe crossings at Silber Way and at Marsh Chapel. An additional crossing is possible at the BU Bridge, which also allows street traffic to cross from the Boston side to the Cambridge side of the Charles River.\n\nAs a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel, and the School of Theology buildings are the university's most recognizable, and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in [[collegiate gothic]] style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston [[brownstone]], especially at [[Bay State Road]] and South Campus, where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories, but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices.\n\nFrom the 1960s\u20131980s many contemporary buildings were constructed, including the Mugar Library, BU Law School, and Warren Towers, all of which were built in the [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] style of architecture. The [[Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering]], constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as [[Structural Expressionism]]. [[Morse Auditorium]], adjacent, stands in stark architectural contrast, as it was originally constructed as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. The most recent architectural additions to BU's campus are the [[Boston University Photonics Center|Photonics Center]], Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|FitRec Center]] and [[Agganis Arena]]), and the [[Boston University School of Management|Questrom School of Business]]. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone.\n\nIn 2018, following negotiations in the preceding year, Boston University purchased the former [[Wheelock College]], which is now referred to as the Boston University Fenway Campus (although it is actually located in the adjacent neighborhood of [[Longwood, Boston|Longwood]]).\n\n{{As of|2019}}, BU has sold or leased to real estate developers several building sites it owned in Kenmore Square next to its campus. Large multistory buildings are being constructed there, which will transform the long-time appearance of the busy traffic hub.<ref name=\"Woolhouse\">{{cite web |last1=Woolhouse |first1=Megan |title=Reimagining Kenmore Square |url=http://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/reimagining-kenmore-square/ |website=BU Today |publisher=Boston University |accessdate=2019-09-21 |language=en |date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924011503/http://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/reimagining-kenmore-square/ |archive-date=September 24, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Student housing====\n{{Main|Boston University Housing System}}\n[[File:WTB BU residence.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A brownstone townhouse used by Boston University as dormitory]]\n[[File:Warren Towers.jpg|thumb|[[Warren Towers]] constitutes the second-largest non-military dorm in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/1999/02-19/yesterday.html |title=BU Bridge.

BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76 percent of the undergraduate population lives on campus. Boston University requires that all students living in dormitories be enrolled in a year-long meal plan with several combinations of meals and dining points which can be used as cash in on-campus facilities.<ref name=\"diningplanrequired\">[http://www.bu.edu/housing/dining/plans/index.html Boston University | Office of Housing | Dining Plans and Convenience Points|Dining Plans], retrieved May 6, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212021154/http://www.bu.edu/housing/dining/plans/index.html |date=December 12, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nHousing at BU is an unusually diverse melange, ranging from individual 19th-century [[brownstone]] [[townhouse]]s and apartment buildings acquired by the school to large-scale high-rises built in the 1960s and 2000s.\n\nThe large dormitories include the 1,800-student [[Warren Towers]], the largest on campus, as well as West Campus and [[Towers (Boston University)|The Towers]]. The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BU's townhouses, often called \"brownstones\". South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.\n\nBoston University's newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 33 Harry Agganis Way, \"StuVi2\" unofficially, and is part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The north-facing, 26-story building is apartment style while the south-facing, 19-story building is in an 8-bedroom dormitory-style suite pattern. In total, the building houses 960 residents.\n\nAside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.\n\nBoston University also provides [[Boston University Housing System#Specialty housing|specialty houses]] or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.\n\nAll large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and validate their school identification before entering.\n\nKilachand Hall, formerly [[Shelton Hall (Boston University)|Shelton Hall]], is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. O'Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers' Corridor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/kilachand-honors-college-students-get-their-own-home/ |title=Kilachand Honors College Students Get Their Own Home |first=Robin |last=Berghaus |website=BU Today |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125131055/http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/kilachand-honors-college-students-get-their-own-home/ |archive-date=January 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====John Hancock Student Village====\n[[File:Student Village II at Boston University.jpg|thumb|Student Village II with Student Village I in the background, as viewed from Nickerson Field]]\n{{Main|John Hancock Student Village}}\nThe Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering {{convert|10|acre|m2}} between Buick Street and [[Nickerson Field]], ground formerly occupied by a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|Armory]], which had been used by the University for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its [[demolition]] and the start of construction. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to \"StuVi\" by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, [[John Hancock Insurance]] announced its sponsorship of the multimillion-dollar project.\n\nThe [[Agganis Arena]], named after [[Harry Agganis]], was opened to concerts and [[ice hockey|hockey]] games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for [[Boston University Terriers#Terrier Hockey|Terrier hockey]] games, replacing the smaller [[Walter Brown Arena]]. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center]], was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body. Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.\n\n====Other facilities====\n[[File:Kilachand Honors College - Boston University - DSC03072.JPG|thumb|The Elie Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies on Bay State Road|right]]\nThe [[Mugar Memorial Library]] is the central academic library for the Charles River Campus.

The University organized formal Centennial observances both in 1939 and 1969.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.bu.edu/info/about/ Boston University |Visitor Center | About the University |History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216154448/http://www.bu.edu/info/about/ |date=February 16, 2006 }}, retrieved May 6, 2006</ref> One or the other, or both dates may appear on various official seals used by different schools of the university.\n\nOn April 24\u201325, 1839 a group of [[Methodist]] ministers and laymen at the Old Bromfield Street Church in Boston elected to establish a Methodist theological school. Set up in Newbury, [[Vermont]], the school was named the \"Newbury Biblical Institute\".\n\nIn 1847, the Congregational Society in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], invited the Institute to relocate to Concord and offered a disused [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational church]] building with a capacity of 1200 people. Other citizens of Concord covered the remodeling costs. One stipulation of the invitation was that the Institute remain in Concord for at least 20 years. The charter issued by New Hampshire designated the school the \"Methodist General Biblical Institute\", but it was commonly called the \"Concord Biblical Institute\".\n\nWith the agreed twenty years coming to a close, the trustees of the Concord Biblical Institute purchased {{convert|30|acre|m2}} on Aspinwall Hill in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], as a possible relocation site. The institute moved in 1867 to 23 Pinkney Street in the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood of Boston, and received a Massachusetts Charter as the \"Boston Theological Seminary\".\n\nIn 1869, three trustees of the Boston Theological Institute obtained from the Massachusetts Legislature a charter for a university by name of \"Boston University\". These trustees were successful Boston businessmen and Methodist laymen, with a history of involvement in educational enterprises, and they became the founders of Boston University. They were Isaac Rich (1801\u20131872), Lee Claflin (1791\u20131871), and Jacob Sleeper (1802\u20131889), for whom Boston University's three [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]] dormitories were later named. Lee Claflin's son, [[William Claflin|William]], was then Governor of Massachusetts and signed the University Charter on May 26, 1869 after it was passed by the Legislature.\n\nAs reported by Kathleen Kilgore in her book, ''Transformations, A History of Boston University'' (see [[Boston University#Further reading|Further reading]]), the founders directed the inclusion in the Charter of the following provision, unusual for its time:\n\n:No instructor in said University shall ever be required by the Trustees to profess any particular religious opinions as a test of office, and no student shall be refused admission... on account of the religious opinions he may entertain; provided, nonetheless, that this section shall not apply to the theological department of said University.\n\nEvery department of the new university was also open to all on an equal footing regardless of sex, race, or (with the exception of the School of Theology) religion.\n\n===Early years (1870\u20131900)===\n[[File:Bell receives honorary LL.D from University of Edinburgh.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|[[Alexander Graham Bell]], who invented the telephone at Boston University]]\n[[File:688 Boylston St.jpg|thumbnail|right|688 Boylston Street, the early home of the College of Liberal Arts, the precursor to the College of Arts & Sciences]]\nThe Boston Theological Institute was absorbed into Boston University in 1871 as the [[Boston University School of Theology|BU School of Theology]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/sth/welcome/about-sth/history/|title=history \u00bb School of Theology|publisher=Boston University|language=en|access-date=October 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016230033/https://www.bu.edu/sth/welcome/about-sth/history/|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1872, [[Isaac Rich]] died, leaving the vast bulk of his estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest consisted of real estate throughout the core of the city of Boston which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university as of that time. By December, however, the [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] had destroyed all but one of the buildings Rich had left to the University, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were [[bankrupt]]. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was half what it had been in 1872.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAs a result, the University was unable to build its contemplated campus on Aspinwall Hill, and the land was sold piecemeal as development sites. Street names in the area, including Claflin Road, Claflin Path, and University Road, are the only remaining evidence of University ownership in this area. Following the fire, Boston University established its new facilities in buildings scattered throughout [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] and later expanded into the [[Boylston Street]] and [[Copley Square]] area before building its Charles River Campus in the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAfter receiving a year's salary advance to allow him to pursue his research in 1875, [[Alexander Graham Bell]], then a professor at the school, invented the telephone in a Boston University laboratory.<ref name=\"Kilgore\">{{cite book |last1=Kilgore|first1=Kathleen|title=Transformations: A History of Boston University|date=1991|publisher=Boston University Press |location=Boston}}</ref> In 1876, [[Borden Parker Bowne]] was appointed professor of philosophy.

The trustees approved the firing of student managers and clamped down on programming and editorial policy, which had been led by Jim Thistle, later a major force in Boston's broadcast news milieu. The on-campus political dispute between Case's conservative administration and the suddenly active and mostly liberal student body led to other disputes over BU student print publications, such as the ''B.U. News'' and the ''Scarlet'', a fraternity association newspaper.\n\nThe Presidency of [[John Silber]] also saw much expansion of the campus and programs.

During his tenure, Brown has strengthened the core missions of undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, interdisciplinary work, and research and scholarship across all 17 schools and colleges.\n\nIn 2007, Brown introduced his 10-year strategic plan, which articulates BU's core values in a set of institutional commitments and defines goals to be met to establish BU as one of the largest private research universities.

One overriding goal has been to break down the barriers between the University's 17 schools and colleges that had evolved over the decades and find ways to combine different fields and researchers within interdisciplinary research centers. This philosophy of creating new knowledge from a variety of corners of the University extends to undergraduate education, as well, which has been overhauled to expose students to new fields and ways of thinking and problem solving. This includes requiring course work outside their majors, development of personal communications skills, and cross-school collaborations.

The [[Boston University Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]] into [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] represents the dividing line between Main Campus, where most schools and classroom buildings are concentrated, and [[Boston University West Campus|West Campus]], home to several athletic facilities and playing fields, the large West Campus dorm, and the new John Hancock Student Village complex.\n\nThe main campus buildings of BU are separated from the [[Charles River Esplanade]] parkland and the [[Paul Dudley White]] Bike Path along the banks of the nearby Charles River, by heavily trafficked [[Storrow Drive]], a high-speed [[limited-access road|limited-access]] major roadway connecting downtown Boston to its western suburbs. The separation occurred in the late 1920s, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seized land by [[eminent domain]] for the construction of the new roadway along the riverbank. A narrow strip of grassy lawn between BU academic buildings lining Commonwealth Avenue and the torrent of traffic on Storrow Drive has been humorously dubbed \"BU Beach\", because it is a favorite hangout for [[sunbathing]] in good weather. The lounging students are protected from traffic incursions by a raised earthen [[berm]], which also muffles the traffic noise to a dull roar. To protect pedestrians from vehicular collisions, Storrow Drive is enclosed by fencing, with [[pedestrian bridge]]s allowing safe crossings at Silber Way and at Marsh Chapel. An additional crossing is possible at the BU Bridge, which also allows street traffic to cross from the Boston side to the Cambridge side of the Charles River.\n\nAs a result of its continual expansion, the Charles River campus contains an array of architecturally diverse buildings. The College of Arts and Sciences, Marsh Chapel, and the School of Theology buildings are the university's most recognizable, and were built in the late-1930s and 1940s in [[collegiate gothic]] style. A sizable amount of the campus is traditional Boston [[brownstone]], especially at [[Bay State Road]] and South Campus, where BU has acquired almost every townhouse those areas offer. The buildings are primarily dormitories, but many also serve as various institutes as well as department offices.\n\nFrom the 1960s\u20131980s many contemporary buildings were constructed, including the Mugar Library, BU Law School, and Warren Towers, all of which were built in the [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] style of architecture. The [[Metcalf Science Center for Science and Engineering]], constructed in 1983, might more accurately be described as [[Structural Expressionism]]. [[Morse Auditorium]], adjacent, stands in stark architectural contrast, as it was originally constructed as a Jewish [[synagogue]]. The most recent architectural additions to BU's campus are the [[Boston University Photonics Center|Photonics Center]], Life Science and Engineering Building, The Student Village (which includes the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|FitRec Center]] and [[Agganis Arena]]), and the [[Boston University School of Management|Questrom School of Business]]. All these buildings were built in brick, a few with a substantial amount of brownstone.\n\nIn 2018, following negotiations in the preceding year, Boston University purchased the former [[Wheelock College]], which is now referred to as the Boston University Fenway Campus (although it is actually located in the adjacent neighborhood of [[Longwood, Boston|Longwood]]).\n\n{{As of|2019}}, BU has sold or leased to real estate developers several building sites it owned in Kenmore Square next to its campus. Large multistory buildings are being constructed there, which will transform the long-time appearance of the busy traffic hub.<ref name=\"Woolhouse\">{{cite web |last1=Woolhouse |first1=Megan |title=Reimagining Kenmore Square |url=http://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/reimagining-kenmore-square/ |website=BU Today |publisher=Boston University |accessdate=2019-09-21 |language=en |date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924011503/http://www.bu.edu/articles/2019/reimagining-kenmore-square/ |archive-date=September 24, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Student housing====\n{{Main|Boston University Housing System}}\n[[File:WTB BU residence.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A brownstone townhouse used by Boston University as dormitory]]\n[[File:Warren Towers.jpg|thumb|[[Warren Towers]] constitutes the second-largest non-military dorm in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/1999/02-19/yesterday.html |title=BU Bridge.

BU was originally a commuter school, but the university now guarantees the option of on-campus housing for four years for all undergraduate students. Currently, 76 percent of the undergraduate population lives on campus.

The smaller dormitory and apartment style housing are mainly located in two parts of campus: Bay State Road and the South Campus residential area. Bay State Road is a tree-lined street that runs parallel to Commonwealth Avenue and is home to the majority of BU's townhouses, often called \"brownstones\". South Campus is a student residential area south of Commonwealth Avenue and separated from the main campus by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. Some of the larger buildings in that area have been converted into dormitories, while the rest of the South Campus buildings are apartments.\n\nBoston University's newest residence and principal apartment-style housing area is officially called 33 Harry Agganis Way, \"StuVi2\" unofficially, and is part of The John Hancock Student Village project. The north-facing, 26-story building is apartment style while the south-facing, 19-story building is in an 8-bedroom dormitory-style suite pattern. In total, the building houses 960 residents.\n\nAside from these main residential areas, smaller residential dormitories are scattered along Commonwealth Avenue.\n\nBoston University also provides [[Boston University Housing System#Specialty housing|specialty houses]] or specialty floors to students who have particular interests.\n\nAll large dormitories have 24/7 security and require all students to swipe and validate their school identification before entering.\n\nKilachand Hall, formerly [[Shelton Hall (Boston University)|Shelton Hall]], is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. O'Neill lived in what was originally room 401 (now 419) while the building was a residential hotel. He died in a hospital on November 27, 1953, and his ghost is rumored to haunt both the room and the floor. The fourth floor is now a specialty floor called the Writers' Corridor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/kilachand-honors-college-students-get-their-own-home/ |title=Kilachand Honors College Students Get Their Own Home |first=Robin |last=Berghaus |website=BU Today |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125131055/http://www.bu.edu/today/2012/kilachand-honors-college-students-get-their-own-home/ |archive-date=January 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====John Hancock Student Village====\n[[File:Student Village II at Boston University.jpg|thumb|Student Village II with Student Village I in the background, as viewed from Nickerson Field]]\n{{Main|John Hancock Student Village}}\nThe Student Village is a large new residential and recreational complex covering {{convert|10|acre|m2}} between Buick Street and [[Nickerson Field]], ground formerly occupied by a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|Armory]], which had been used by the University for indoor track and field and as a storage facility before its [[demolition]] and the start of construction. The dormitory of apartment suites at 10 Buick Street (often abbreviated to \"StuVi\" by students) opened to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2000. In 2002, [[John Hancock Insurance]] announced its sponsorship of the multimillion-dollar project.\n\nThe [[Agganis Arena]], named after [[Harry Agganis]], was opened to concerts and [[ice hockey|hockey]] games in January 2005. The Agganis Arena is capable of housing 6,224 spectators for [[Boston University Terriers#Terrier Hockey|Terrier hockey]] games, replacing the smaller [[Walter Brown Arena]]. It can also be used for concerts and shows. In March 2005, the final element of phase II of the Student Village complex, the [[Fitness and Recreation Center|Fitness and Recreation (FitRec) Center]], was opened, drawing large crowds from the student body. Construction on the rest of phase II, which included 19- and 26-story residential towers was finished in fall 2009.\n\n====Other facilities====\n[[File:Kilachand Honors College - Boston University - DSC03072.JPG|thumb|The Elie Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies on Bay State Road|right]]\nThe [[Mugar Memorial Library]] is the central academic library for the Charles River Campus.
