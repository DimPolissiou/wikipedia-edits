After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchsto\u00dflegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that \"Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny.\"<ref>Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890\u20131945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84.</ref> Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]].

In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the \"Golden Age of Propaganda\". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom. US [[war film]]s in the early 1940s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and [[consensus|convince]] viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the [[Axis Powers]].<ref>Philip M.

Both sides used film, television, and radio programming to influence their own citizens, each other, and Third World nations.

Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as \"things that must be disseminated\", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term \"propaganda\" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word \"propaganda\" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&nbsp;\u2013 \"advertising\".\n\n[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]\nIn English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly \"compelling\" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. ... The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate, and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council,' 'specialist in public education,' 'public relations adviser.' \"<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2378152|last1 = Lasswell|first1 = Harold D.|title = The Function of the Propagandist|journal = International Journal of Ethics|volume = 38|issue = 3|pages = 258\u2013268|year = 1928|doi = 10.1086/intejethi.38.3.2378152}} pp. 260\u2013261</ref> In 1949, political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote, \"After World War I the word came to be applied to 'what you don\u2019t like of the other fellow\u2019s publicity,' as Edward L.

Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/wwii-propaganda-private-snafu-flashback|title=This WWII Cartoon Taught Soldiers How to Avoid Certain Death|last=McNearney|first=Allison|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels.\"<ref>Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232\u2013233</ref> The definition focuses on the communicative process involved \u2013 or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. \n[[File:Propaganda poster in a primary school - DPRK (2604154887).jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda poster in North Korean primary school]]\n\nAccording to historian [[Zbyn\u011bk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins<ref name=\"new\">{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|isbn=978-0-85613-312-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sellingwarartpro0000zema}}</ref> (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.\n<!-- [[File:Edith Cavell propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of British nurse [[Edith Cavell#Role in World War I propaganda|Edith Cavell]] by the German Army in 1915 was a major theme of [[World War I]] anti-German propaganda.]] -->\n\n[[File:Propaganda Poster in North Korea.jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korea]]\n\nThe propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.\n\n[[File:The Papal Belvedere.jpg|thumb|left|From a series of woodcuts (1545) usually referred to as the ''Papstspotbilder'' or ''Papstspottbilder'' in German or ''Depictions of the Papacy'' in English,<ref name=Oberman>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_leG5ztYoZwC&pg=PA61|title=The Impact of the Reformation: Essays|first=Heiko Augustinus|last=Oberman|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Wm.

The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s. [[Anti-cult movement|Anti-cult activists]] and [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult activists]] accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and [[CESNUR]] affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of \"cults\" and the [[anti-cult movement]] of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Religious Movements Page: Conceptualizing \"Cult\" and \"Sect\" | url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042448/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archivedate=7 February 2006 | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Polish Anti-Cult Movement (Koscianska) \u2013 CESNUR | url=http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/koscianska.htm | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Wartime===\n[[File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png|thumb|upright|left|A US Office for War Information poster uses [[stereotype]]d imagery to encourage Americans to work hard to contribute to the war effort]]\n\nPost\u2013World War II usage of the word \"propaganda\" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.\n\nPropaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as \"Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly.\"<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 \u2013  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.</ref> Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it.\n\nPropaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).<ref>Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947\u20131963. Durham University. 1999.</ref> The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.\n\n[[File:Britannialion.jpg|thumb|[[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]] arm-in-arm with [[Uncle Sam]] symbolizes the British-American alliance in World War I.]]\n\nPropaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.\n\nIn the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.<ref>Karel C. Berkhoff, ''Motherland in Danger: Soviet Propaganda during World War II'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Motherland-Danger-Soviet-Propaganda-during/dp/0674049241/ excerpt and text search]</ref> Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent. That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero. Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered. Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his \"majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Zhores A.

On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.\n\n===Politics===\nPropaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as \"covert propaganda\".\n\nRoderick Hindery argues<ref>https://propagandaandcriticalthought.com/author/rhindery/</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Hindery | first=Roderick | title=Indoctrination and self-deception or free and critical thought | publisher=E.

Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/[[counterterrorism]]. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.\n\n[[File:Is this tomorrow.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Anti-communism|Anti-communist]] propaganda in a 1947 comic book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of \"the dangers of a Communist takeover\"]]\n\nSince [[9/11]] and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain.

[[Software agent]]s or [[Internet bot|bots]] can be used for many things, including populating [[social media]] with [[Media manipulation|automated messages]] and posts with a range of sophistication. During the 2016 U.S. election a cyber-strategy was implemented using bots to direct US voters to Russian political news and information sources, and to spread politically motivated rumors and false news stories.

Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.<ref>Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda & Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\nA number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.\n\nSome time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. <!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to \"destroy the old world, forge the new world,\" referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] -->\n\nPropaganda can also be turned on its makers.  For example [[postage stamps]] have frequently been tools for government advertising, such as [[North Korea]]'s extensive issues.<ref>[https://qz.com/1017141/north-koreas-america-hating-postage-stamps-are-mini-masterpieces-of-anti-imperialist-propaganda/ North Korea\u2019s America-hating postage stamps are mini masterpieces of anti-imperialist propaganda]</ref>  The presence of [[Stalin]] on numerous Soviet stamps is another example.<ref>[https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/184/199 Stalin on Stamps and other Philatelic Materials:Design, Propaganda, Politics]</ref>  During the [[Third Reich]] [[Hitler]] frequently appeared on postage stamps in Germany and some of the occupied nations.

Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s.

The theory postulates five general classes of \"filters\" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.\n\nThe first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important.

The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany in the form of the [[Hitler Youth]].\n\n[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to \"dumb us down\" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories.

After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchsto\u00dflegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that \"Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny.\"<ref>Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890\u20131945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84.</ref> Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]].

In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the \"Golden Age of Propaganda\". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom.

Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as \"things that must be disseminated\", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term \"propaganda\" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word \"propaganda\" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&nbsp;\u2013 \"advertising\".\n\n[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]\nIn English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly \"compelling\" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, \"In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. ... The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it.

Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: \"Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/wwii-propaganda-private-snafu-flashback|title=This WWII Cartoon Taught Soldiers How to Avoid Certain Death|last=McNearney|first=Allison|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels.\"<ref>Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232\u2013233</ref> The definition focuses on the communicative process involved \u2013 or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow \"propaganda\" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. \n[[File:Propaganda poster in a primary school - DPRK (2604154887).jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda poster in North Korean primary school]]\n\nAccording to historian [[Zbyn\u011bk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins<ref name=\"new\">{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|isbn=978-0-85613-312-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sellingwarartpro0000zema}}</ref> (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.\n<!-- [[File:Edith Cavell propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of British nurse [[Edith Cavell#Role in World War I propaganda|Edith Cavell]] by the German Army in 1915 was a major theme of [[World War I]] anti-German propaganda.]] -->\n\n[[File:Propaganda Poster in North Korea.jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korea]]\n\nThe propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.\n\n[[File:The Papal Belvedere.jpg|thumb|left|From a series of woodcuts (1545) usually referred to as the ''Papstspotbilder'' or ''Papstspottbilder'' in German or ''Depictions of the Papacy'' in English,<ref name=Oberman>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_leG5ztYoZwC&pg=PA61|title=The Impact of the Reformation: Essays|first=Heiko Augustinus|last=Oberman|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Wm.

The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s. [[Anti-cult movement|Anti-cult activists]] and [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult activists]] accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and [[CESNUR]] affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of \"cults\" and the [[anti-cult movement]] of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Religious Movements Page: Conceptualizing \"Cult\" and \"Sect\" | url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042448/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archivedate=7 February 2006 | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Polish Anti-Cult Movement (Koscianska) \u2013 CESNUR | url=http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/koscianska.htm | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Wartime===\n[[File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png|thumb|upright|left|A US Office for War Information poster uses [[stereotype]]d imagery to encourage Americans to work hard to contribute to the war effort]]\n\nPost\u2013World War II usage of the word \"propaganda\" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.\n\nPropaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms \"Jap\" and \"gook\" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as \"Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly.\"<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 \u2013  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.</ref> Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the \"actor\" or \"system\" that performs it.\n\nPropaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).<ref>Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947\u20131963. Durham University. 1999.</ref> The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select \"agreeable\" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.\n\n[[File:Britannialion.jpg|thumb|[[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]] arm-in-arm with [[Uncle Sam]] symbolizes the British-American alliance in World War I.]]\n\nPropaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a \"well-known fact\", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.\n\nIn the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.<ref>Karel C.

That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero.

On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily \"believed\" or \"internalized\". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of \"covert\" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.\n\n===Politics===\nPropaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as \"covert propaganda\".\n\nRoderick Hindery argues<ref>https://propagandaandcriticalthought.com/author/rhindery/</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Hindery | first=Roderick | title=Indoctrination and self-deception or free and critical thought | publisher=E.

Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking \"what is or is not propaganda?\" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/[[counterterrorism]]. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.\n\n[[File:Is this tomorrow.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Anti-communism|Anti-communist]] propaganda in a 1947 comic book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of \"the dangers of a Communist takeover\"]]\n\nSince [[9/11]] and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain.

[[Software agent]]s or [[Internet bot|bots]] can be used for many things, including populating [[social media]] with [[Media manipulation|automated messages]] and posts with a range of sophistication. During the 2016 U.S. election a cyber-strategy was implemented using bots to direct US voters to Russian political news and information sources, and to spread politically motivated rumors and false news stories. At this point it is considered commonplace contemporary political strategy around the world to implement bots in achieving political goals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Philip N.|last2=Woolley|first2=Samuel|last3=Calo|first3=Ryan|date=2018-04-03|title=Algorithms, bots, and political communication in the US 2016 election: The challenge of automated political communication for election law and administration|journal=Journal of Information Technology & Politics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=81\u201393|doi=10.1080/19331681.2018.1448735|issn=1933-1681|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{details|Propaganda techniques}}\n\n[[File:Anti-capitalism color.gif|right|upright|thumb|[[Anti-Capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] propaganda]]\n\nCommon media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, [[junk science]], books, leaflets, [[propaganda film|movies]], radio, television, and posters. Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.<ref>Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda & Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\nA number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.\n\nSome time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. <!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to \"destroy the old world, forge the new world,\" referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] -->\n\nPropaganda can also be turned on its makers.  For example [[postage stamps]] have frequently been tools for government advertising, such as [[North Korea]]'s extensive issues.<ref>[https://qz.com/1017141/north-koreas-america-hating-postage-stamps-are-mini-masterpieces-of-anti-imperialist-propaganda/ North Korea\u2019s America-hating postage stamps are mini masterpieces of anti-imperialist propaganda]</ref>  The presence of [[Stalin]] on numerous Soviet stamps is another example.<ref>[https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/184/199 Stalin on Stamps and other Philatelic Materials:Design, Propaganda, Politics]</ref>  During the [[Third Reich]] [[Hitler]] frequently appeared on postage stamps in Germany and some of the occupied nations.

Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize\u2013winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.\n\nAccording to [[William W. Biddle]]'s 1931 article \"A psychological definition of propaganda\", \"[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of \"we\" versus an \"enemy\"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0074944 |title = A psychological definition of propaganda|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume = 26|issue = 3|pages = 283\u2013295|year = 1931|last1 = Biddle|first1 = W.

Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] which argues [[systemic bias]]es exist in the mass media and seeks to explain them in terms of structural economic [[cause]]s:\n\n{{quote|The 20th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth of [[corporate power]], and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy.<ref>\"Letter from Noam Chomsky\" to ''Covert Action Quarterly,'' quoting [[Alex Carey (writer)|Alex Carey]], Australian social scientist, {{cite web |url=http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |title=Letter from Noam Chomsky |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710125156/http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/25/006.html|title=Review of Alex Carey, Taking the Risk out of Democracy: Propaganda in the US and Australia|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nFirst presented in their book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'' (1988), the [[propaganda model]] views the private media as businesses selling a product&nbsp;\u2013 readers and [[audiences]] (rather than news)&nbsp;\u2013 to other businesses (advertisers) and relying primarily on government and corporate information and propaganda. The theory postulates five general classes of \"filters\" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.\n\nThe first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles the [[model (abstract)|model]] postulates as the cause of [[media bias]].\n\n=== Self-propaganda ===\n[[Self-propaganda]] is a form of propaganda that refers to the act of an individual convincing them-self of something, no matter how irrational that idea may be.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQE9rD5X0m4C&lpg=PA242&dq=%22self%20propaganda%22&pg=PA242#v=onepage&q=%22self%20propaganda%22&f=false|title=A Mask for Privilege: Anti-Semitism in America|date=1949|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-1615-1|language=en}}</ref> Self propaganda makes it easier for individuals to justify their own actions as well as the actions of others.

They participate in the revolution and are very studious.\"]]\nOf all the potential targets for propaganda, children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether a message is propaganda or not. The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany in the form of the [[Hitler Youth]].\n\n[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to \"dumb us down\" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories. This ties into the Herman and Chomsky thesis of [[Political positions of Noam Chomsky#Criticism of United States government|rise of Corporate Power]], and its use in creating educational systems which serve its purposes against those of democracy.\n\n===Anti-Semitic propaganda for children===\nIn [[Nazi]] Germany, the education system was thoroughly co-opted to indoctrinate the German youth with [[anti-Semitic]] ideology. From the 1920\u2019s on, the Nazi Party targeted German youth as one of their special audience for its propaganda messages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goutam |first1=Urvashi |title=Pedagogical Nazi Propaganda (1939-1945) |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |date=2014 |volume=75 |pages=1018\u20131026 |jstor=44158487 |issn=2249-1937}}</ref> Schools and texts mirrored what the Nazi\u2019s aimed of instilling in German youth through the utilization and promotion of racial theory. \u201cA key in the rise of anti-Semitic propaganda for children was influenced by Julius Streicher, the editor of Der Sturmer (The Storm Trooper) and head of a publishing house used to disseminate anti-Semitic propaganda throughout the Hitler years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corelli|first=Marie|date=May\u2013June 2002|title=Poisoning young minds in Nazi Germany: children and propaganda in the Third Reich|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-87508010|journal=Social Education|volume=66 |issue=4 |page=228}}</ref> This was accomplished through the [[National Socialist Teachers League]], of which 97% of all German teachers were members in 1937.

Slogans such as \"Judas the Jew betrayed Jesus the German to the Jews\" were recited in class.

Cable networks [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on the series, while broadcast networks [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (United States) and the [[CBC Television|CBC]] (Canada) expressed interest. The show was first sold to the CBC, but the Levys decided against ABC as its U.S. broadcaster due to the network's alleged history of creative interference. ''Schitt's Creek'' eventually found a U.S. home on Pop TV after striking a deal with network head Brad Schwartz, who had previously hired Daniel on [[MTV (Canada)|MTV Canada]].<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nDuring the early stages of development, various networks suggested the title of the show be changed to make it sound less vulgar. The Levys resisted these suggestions and argued \"Schitt\" was a legitimate last name. To prove their point, they brought pages copied from a phone book to the CBC showing listings for individuals with the \"Schitt\" surname.

The event included behind-the-scenes stories; a live question and answer session with the cast; and an audience participation trivia game. Following the initial event's success, the tour was expanded to include stops in several additional U.S. and Canadian cities in 2019.

Cable networks [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] passed on the series, while broadcast networks [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (United States) and the [[CBC Television|CBC]] (Canada) expressed interest. The show was first sold to the CBC, but the Levys decided against ABC as its U.S. broadcaster due to the network's alleged history of creative interference. ''Schitt's Creek'' eventually found a U.S. home on Pop TV after striking a deal with network head Brad Schwartz, who had previously hired Daniel on [[MTV (Canada)|MTV Canada]].<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nDuring the early stages of development, various networks suggested the title of the show be changed to make it sound less profane. The Levys resisted these suggestions and argued \"Schitt\" was a legitimate last name. To prove their point, they brought pages copied from a phone book to the CBC showing listings for individuals with the \"Schitt\" surname. The CBC agreed and allowed the Levys to keep the original title.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2015/01/12/how_eugene_levy_convinced_cbc_to_name_his_show_schitts_creek.html|title=How Eugene Levy convinced CBC to name his show 'Schitt's Creek'|last=Wong|first=Tony|date=January 12, 2015|newspaper=Toronto Star|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref> The name has still faced censorship issues during promotional tours in the United States, with many networks shortening the title or providing extra disclaimers before using it on-air.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/02/schitt-s-creek-sitcom-polite-reviewers-find-themselves-without-a-paddle.html|title=The Winding Circumlocutions of Schitt's Creek Reviews|last=Friedman|first=Nancy|date=February 16, 2015|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=July 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Levy initially envisioned the series ending with season five, but agreed to a sixth season after receiving a two-year renewal following the show's fourth season.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/dan-levy-schitts-creek-final-season-interview|title=Dan Levy Cried Over the End of 'Schitt's Creek' (and You Will Too)|last=Meslow|first=Scott|date=November 13, 2019|website=GQ|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Catherine O'Hara]] was the series creators' first choice for the role of eccentric family matriarch, Moira Rose.

She initially turned down Levy's offer to star in ''Schitt's Creek'', citing \"laziness\" and an aversion to long-term projects.
