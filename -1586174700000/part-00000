The mission was launched to help restore stability to the Congo after it fell into [[Congo Crisis|conflict and disorder]] following independence. ONUC was the UN's first peacekeeping mission with a significant military force. It was withdrawn in 1964.\n\nFollowing Security Council actions, the United Nations Organisation in the Congo was established. To carry out these tasks, the Secretary-General set up a United Nations Force\u2014at its peak strength numbering nearly 20,000.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/timeline/pages/onuc.html|title = UN Operation in the Congo|website = United Nations|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702212648/http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/timeline/pages/onuc.html|archivedate = 2 July 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> The UN Force stayed in the Congo between 1960 and 1964, and underwent a transition from a peacekeeping presence to a military force.\n\nONUC's main goals stayed consistent from the first to fifth resolution. It aimed to both have [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian military]] personnel (later expanding to [[Mercenary#Congo Crisis|mercenaries]]) withdrawn and to provide military assistance to ensure internal stability. The successive Security Council resolutions added to and elaborated on the initial mandate but did not fundamentally change the operation's objectives. These were especially significant because Belgium's invasion violated the norm of sovereignty, and the second objective was set to prevent the country from becoming a Cold War [[client state]].<ref name= boulden35>{{harvnb|Boulden|2001|pp=35\u201337}}</ref>\n\nThe first troops reached Congo on 15 July 1960, many airlifted by the [[United States Air Force]] as part of Operation New Tape.<ref>{{cite web|editor-last=Warnock |editor-first=A.

While the President and the Prime Minister were trying to negotiate with the mutineers, the Belgian government decided to intervene to protect Belgians that remained in the country. It also, with the acceptance of [[Mo\u00efse Tshomb\u00e9]], sent troops to take over [[State of Katanga|Katanga]] and establish a secession there to protect mining interests.

The resolution authorized the Secretary-General to facilitate the withdrawal of Belgian troops, maintain law and order, and help to establish and legitimize the post-colonial government.

Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force.

Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.\n\nIn response, Lumumba accused the UN of siding with Tshombe and foreign mining companies. Lumumba then asked the Soviet Union for assistance and received aid in the form of trucks and aircraft. Using material of the former Force Publique, Lumumba ordered the army to launch an attack on the breakaway Katanga province, but failed to take it back.

Following assurances that contingents of the Force would arrive in sufficient numbers, the Belgian authorities agreed to withdraw all their forces from the Leopoldville area by 23 July. The last Belgian troops left the country by 23 July, as United Nations forces continued to deploy throughout the Congo. The buildup continued, ONUC's strength increasing to over 8,000 by 25 July and to over 11,000 by 31 July 1960. A basic agreement between the United Nations and the Congolese Government on the operation of the Force was finalized by 27 July.\n\nOn 9 August 1960, Kalonji declared the region of south-eastern Kasai, on the Congo's southern border with [[Portuguese Angola]], to be the new Mining State of [[South Kasai]] (''\u00c9tat minier du Sud-Kasa\u00ef'') or Autonomous State of South Kasai (''\u00c9tat autonome du Sud-Kasa\u00ef'').{{sfn|Packham|1996|p=37}}{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=105}} The use of the word \"state\" (''\u00e9tat'') was deliberately ambiguous, allowing Kalonji to avoid specifying whether the South Kasai claimed to independence as a nation-state in imitation of Katanga, or as a province within the Congo.{{sfn|Le Potentiel|2008}} Due to rejection of requests to the UN for aid to suppress the South Kasai and Katanga revolts, the [[Lumumba Government]] decided to request Soviet assistance. De Witte writes that \"Leopoldville asked the Soviet Union for planes, lorries, arms, and equipment. ...Shortly afterwards, on 22 or 23 August, about 1,000 soldiers left for Kasai.\"<ref>De Witte, ''The Assassination of Lumumba'', 2001, 16</ref> De Witte goes on to write that on 26\u201327 August, the ANC seized [[Mbuji-Mayi|Bakwanga]], Albert Kalonji's capital in South Kasai, without serious resistance. \"In the next two days it temporarily put an end to the secession of Kasai.\"<ref>de Witte, 2001, 16.</ref>\n\nBloomfield wrote in 1963 that:<ref>Lincoln P.

While relationships with the ANC ([[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]]) were complicated by the latter's lack of responsible commanders at any level, in most instances the ANC during that first month did lay down arms wherever there were UN troops, and ONUC took over custody of arms, ammunition depots, and arsenals. Local UN commanders used their own judgment as to how to keep the Congolese troops under control, with outstanding success in many areas.</blockquote>\n\nBy February 1961, there were four factions in the Congo: [[Antoine Gizenga]] (leading Lumumba's followers), [[Joseph-Desire Mobutu]], Tshombe, and the self-appointed King [[Albert Kalonji]]. There were four separate armed forces: Mobotu's ANC itself, numbering about 12,000, the [[South Kasai]] Constabulary loyal to [[Albert Kalonji]] (3,000 or less), the [[Katanga Gendarmerie]] which were part of [[Moise Tshombe]]'s regime (totalling about 10,000), and the Stanleyville dissident ANC loyal to [[Antoine Gizenga]] (numbering about 8,000).<ref>Gordon McDonald et al., ''U.S. Army Area Handbook for the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville)'' [issued by the Foreign Area Studies Division of American University], June 1962, p. 620.</ref>\n\n=== 1961 ===\nEarly in 1961, Patrice Lumumba was assassinated. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] reacted sharply. Calling it \u201can international crime of the first magnitude\u201d, he asked Hammarskj\u00f6ld to take a tough line. When the Security Council passed a second resolution on 21 February 1961, Nehru agreed to send an [[Indian Army]] brigade of some 4,700 troops to the Congo.<ref name=\"livemint.com\">https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/9D5XT497AEYYluFn3moa2H/When-Indian-troops-entered-Congo-55-years-ago.html</ref> Thus United Nations mission was strengthened and expanded in response, in an effort to keep foreign mercenaries out of country. In August of that year, three of the four groups claiming control of the country, Lumumba, Mobutu and Kalonji, reconciled with help from the United Nations.<ref name=\":1\" /> It resulted in the restoration of the country's parliament and prevented the outbreak of a large civil war. Tshombe's breakaway Katanga province was not part of this reconciliation. United Nations forces clashed with Tshombe's foreign mercenaries several times late in the year.\n\nOn 17 September 1961, UN Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]] was flying to [[Rhodesia]] to negotiate peace talks between the government and Tshombe [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|when Hammarskj\u00f6ld's plane crashed]], killing him.<ref name=\":1\" /> It was a response to the troubled Operation Morthor ongoing at the time.

No legal investigation has been made of the shootings.<ref name=\"SvM2\" />{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter Hammarskj\u00f6ld's death, his replacement, U Thant, took a more aggressive approach. Removing Tshombe from Katanga became the primary military objective for the UN.{{citation needed|date= December 2016}} In December 1961, UN troops from Sweden, Ireland, India, and Ethiopia were involved in heavy fighting for Katanga's capital, Elizabethville. UN forces eventually managed to defeat the Katangan gendarmes in the city and took Elizabethville. During the fighting, eleven Swedish soldiers were taken prisoner; they were released on 15 January 1962 in exchange for Katangan gendarmes.\n\nIn August 1961, under the command of [[Indian Army]]'s Brigadier-General KAS Raja, the UN launched Operation Rumpunch, a surprise attack that led to the peaceful surrender of 81 foreign mercenaries.\n\n=== Operation Morthor ===\n[[File:United Nations peacekeeping air forces in Congo - January 1963.jpg|thumbnail|right|United Nations peacekeeping forces of [[Kingdom of Iran|Iran]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Sweden]] in [[Kamina Air Base]], January 1963]]\n\nOn 13 September 1961, the most obvious example of the transition from peacekeeping to peace enforcement occurred when the [[India]]n ONUC leadership on the ground leading an Indian brigade, launched \"Operation Morthor\" ([[Hindi]]: smash and grab) and swiftly took control of Katanga. The operation was meant to be a stepped up version of the earlier Operation Rumpunch. It has been said that Secretary-General Hammarskj\u00f6ld did not know the operation was happening.

Operation Morthor was executed with Indian support, but without full approval by several member countries of the UN, particularly the UK, France, and United States. The Soviet Union was angrily accusing the US of supporting the assassination of Lumumba, a Soviet ally, and of installing American ally Mobutu as president. The Soviet state interpreted ONUC to now be acting as a proxy for the US rather than supporting the interests of the entire Security Council.<ref>Bellamy, Alex J., Paul Williams, and Stuart Griffin. ''Understanding Peacekeeping''. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2010.</ref>\n\nDuring the fighting, a UN spokesperson accounted that the Katanga secession movement was over. Most observers interpreted that as meaning that the UN military forces had successfully defeated Tshombe's troops, but the announcement was premature in every possible way.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the operation, a company of 156 Irish UN troops was attacked by Moise Tshombe's forces in Katanga. The Irish were seriously outnumbered and outgunned, but managed to hold out for six days until they finally ran out of ammunition. The Irish managed to inflict heavy losses against Tshombe's foreign mercenaries, without any of their own being [[Killed in action|killed]] themselves. This event is known as the [[Siege of Jadotville]].\n\n=== End of the Katangan secession ===\n{{main|Operation Grandslam}}\n[[File:Swedish UN troops in Congo. Major Sture Fagerstr\u00f6m, orients his platoon leaders before the attack on Kaminaville in Katanga, Congo 1963.jpg|225px|thumb|Swedish troops plan offensive actions for Operation Grandslam]]\n\nThe United Nations launched [[Operation Unokat]] in early December 1961, which put pressure on Tshombe to enter serious negotiations with Congolese Prime Minister [[Cyrille Adoula]]. On 21 December Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration, an agreement whereby he would recognize the authority of the central government and work to reintegrate Katanga into the Republic of the Congo.<ref name= boulden38>{{harvnb|Boulden|2001|p=38}}</ref> However, Tshombe subsequently deferred to the Katangan Parliament and put off any action of reconciliation. In January 1962 the rival government of the [[Free Republic of the Congo]] was finally subdued and the UN was able to refocus its efforts on ending the Katangan secession. By then contact between the central government and Katanga had broken down, and ONUC intelligence reports indicated that the latter was rebuilding its forces.<ref name= Mockaitis35>{{harvnb|Mockaitis|1999|p=35}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1962 Secretary General Thant drew up a \"Plan for National Reconciliation\" by which Katanga would rejoin a [[Federalism|federalized]] Congo. Adoula and Tshombe both accepted the proposal. Thant was wary of Tshombe's delaying tactics and applied increasing political pressure on the Katangan government to abide by the plan's timetable.<ref name= Mockaitis35/> Still doubting the likelihood of a peaceful resolution of the Katangan secession, he sent [[Ralph Bunche]] to [[L\u00e9opoldville]]. There, Bunch worked with local UN Mission Chief Robert Gardiner and UN Force Commander [[Sean MacEoin (general)|Sean MacEoin]] to create a plan to achieve freedom of movement for ONUC personnel and eliminate the foreign mercenaries. By then it was obvious that Tshombe did not intend on rejoining the Congo; there were 300\u2013500 mercenaries in Katanga (as many as there had been before previous UN operations) and new airfields and defensive positions were being constructed. ONUC personnel and even consuls from troop-contributing supporters of ONUC faced increasing harassment at the hands of Katangan forces.<ref name= Mockaitis36>{{harvnb|Mockaitis|1999|p=36}}</ref>\n\nThe situation came to a breaking point on 24 December 1962 when Katangan gendarmes brazenly attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga, causing Thant to authorize a retaliatory offensive to decisively eliminate secessionist opposition.<ref name= boulden39>{{harvnb|Boulden|2001|p=39}}</ref>\n\nMajor General [[Dewan Prem Chand]] launched Operation Grandslam on 28 December and by the end of the day UN troops had seized downtown \u00c9lisabethville.<ref name= Mockaitis36/> Reinforced by recently amassed air power, United Nations peacekeepers successfully completed the first phase of the operation by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the [[Lufira River]] ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangan lines and causing an incident among United Nations leadership.<ref name= Mockaitis37>{{harvnb|Mockaitis|1999|p=37}}</ref> Tshombe, realizing that his position was untenable, sued for peace on 15 January 1963. Two days later he signed an instrument of surrender and declared the Katangan secession to be over.\n\n=== Final activities ===\nAfter Operation Grandslam, the United Nations shrank the force significantly, only keeping a small peacekeeping force in the country.\n\nBy autumn 1963 plans were underway to remove the United Nations force from the Congo after the reincorporation of Katanga.<ref>Arthur House, ''The UN in the Congo: The Civilian Operations'', University Press of America, 1978, p. 166.</ref> At that time six battalions of UN troops were stationed in Katanga, one battalion was at [[Luluabourg (city)|Luluabourg]], one at Force Headquarters, and administration personnel were at [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]].\n\nCanadian Brigadier-General [[Jacques Dextraze]] was sent to the Congo in 1963, to serve as mission Chief of Staff, effectively deputy to the mission's military commander.

Lumumba assassination shocked Nehru who reacted sharply. Calling it \u201can international crime of the first magnitude\u201d, he asked Hammarskj\u00f6ld to take a tough line. When the Security Council passed a second resolution on 21 February 1961, Nehru agreed to send an Indian Army brigade of some 4,700 troops to the Congo. Kasavubu and Mobutu took great exception to these moves. They had all along resented Dayal's and Nehru's support for Lumumba. Now they threatened dire consequences for the UN mission if Dayal remained at its helm. At Hammarskj\u00f6ld's request, Nehru agreed that Dayal should step down.\n\nYet, the Indian involvement was set to escalate. On 13 September, the Indian brigade launched Operation Morthor (Hindi: twist and break) that swiftly took control of Katanga. The staff officer who planned the operation would later become the chief of the Indian Army: Major K.S. Sundarji. It was in this context that the British government sought to arrange that fateful meeting between Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Tshombe in Ndola, ostensibly to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nOn the eve of Operation Rum Punch the UN had 5,720 troops in Katanga; there were 1,600 Indians, 500 Irish, and 400 Swedes in \u00c9lisabethville, 1,200 Indians in Albertville, 1,000 Indians at Kamina Base, 500 Indians at Kabalo, 400 Ethiopians and Indians in Manono, and 120 Irish in Jadotville.\n\nNehru doubled down on his support for the UN in Congo. India sent more troops than any country and these men were active throughout 1962 in stubbing out the secessionist forces, Indian Army units leading the fight. The UN forces were commanded by Indian officers including Major General [[Dewan Prem Chand]]. Even during the war with China, Nehru did not insist on an immediate withdrawal of the Indian brigade, but the Canberra bombers that it had deployed, were called back. The troops returned only after the mission was completed in March 1963.<ref name=\"livemint.com\"/>\n\n=== Malayan Army involvement ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nMalaya (now [[Malaysia]]) was invited to send a contingent to serve in ONUC. The Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] Putra, in response to the United Nations' request offered a force of 120 men in a telegram to the Secretary-General on 4 August 1960. On 24 August, in another telegram to New York, the force level was increased to 450 men. Eventually, the force level was settled at 613 all ranks. The name given to this force for service with ONUC was Malayan Special Force or MSF in short. The original force was drawn from two of the finest units in the Federation Army - 4th Battalion, the [[Royal Malay Regiment]] and 'C' Squadron 2nd Reconnaissance Regiment (now 2 Armour). It had a complement of 42 officers and 571 other ranks.\n\n=== Swedish Armed involvement ===\n[[File:Congo Crisis Swedish Soldiers.jpg|thumb|Swedish UN soldiers armed with sub machine guns at one of the access roads to [[Niemba]] in November 1961.]]\nSweden had an active role in the UN forces during the crisis. When Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld established UN Mission ONUC he organized it into two parts: one military and one civilian. The Swedish Major General [[Carl von Horn (1903\u20131989)|Carl von Horn]] became the head of the military part and the Swedish diplomat Sture Linn\u00e9r was responsible for the civilians.<ref name=\"theses.lub.lu.se\">{{cite web |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=1325876&fileOId=1325877 |publisher=[[Lund University]], Department of Political Science |title=Kongokrisen - FN-insatsen 1960-64 i analys |trans-title=Congo Crisis - Analysis of the UN mission in 1960-64 |first1=Thomas |last1=Nilsson |first2=Jimmy |last2=Persson |page=10 |date=2006 |access-date=20 April 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Both of them were subject to American [[Ralph Bunche]], who was appointed head of the whole operation.\n\n==== Air Force ====\nIn September 1961, in response to an appeal by the [[United Nations]] (UN) for military support, an initial force of five [[Saab 29 Tunnan|J 29Bs]] were stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Republic of Congo]] as a contribution to a UN peacekeeping mission ([[ONUC]]) in the region, organized as the F 22 Wing of the [[Swedish Air Force]].<ref name=\"widf\">{{cite book|last1=Widfeldt|first1=Bo|title=The Saab J 29|date=1966|publisher=Profile Publications Ltd.|location=Leatherhead, Surrey, UK| page=9}}</ref> It was subsequently reinforced by four more J 29Bs and two S 29C photo reconnaissance Tunnans in 1962.

He therefore requested that Sweden and Ireland would send a battalion each, with the ulterior motive that they would more easily win the confidence of the whites than soldiers from African states. The first Swedish battalion arrived in Congo directly from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] 22 July 1960. The first days the Swedes were patrolling in Leopoldville and guarded [[N'djili Airport|Kinshasa Airport]] in the city.\n\nSwedes, like other UN troops, had difficulty knowing who really were friends and who were enemies, and the fighting they engaged in did not always have an apparent rational reason. In August, the Swedes moved to Elizabethville in Katanga, where they ended up in their first combat situation and suffered their first loss in connection with the escort of a rail road transport. The trains, which were carrying Katangan [[Baluba]] prisoners, were attacked by Baluba, a nationalist group who supported the central government against the break out government. In practice, at that point, the Swedes fought on the same side as the Belgian-led Katangan gendarmerie, who would later become the UN's worst enemy.\n\nThe Swedes had to try to maintain order in a huge camp with approximately 40,000 Baluba refugees in Kasai which was suddenly formed in just two weeks in 1961, with refugees fleeing Gendarmerie attacks in north Katanga.<ref name=\"Stendahl (2014)\"/> In 1962, the Swedes moved to the Kamina base, near the town of [[Kamina]].

This numbering continued from Battalion 1 to Battalion 9 which was initially deployed in the Sinai and later in Gaza. After Battalion 9 the numbering was changed to include only odd numbers starting with 11 and with additional letter G for Gaza. Battalion 8 was transferred from Gaza to the Congo and then took the name Battalion VIII K (Kongo (Congo)). So, seven of the Congo battalions, 10 to 22, were recruited to serve in ONUC, while the other two were Gaza battalions transferred to the Congo as reinforcements.\n\n=== Irish Army involvement ===\nThe [[Irish Army]]'s first large deployment to the Congo was in 1960. The 32nd Infantry Battalion was the first deployment of Irish troops overseas and they were woefully ill-equipped. The standard uniform was a heavy bullswool tunic and trousers and the service rifle was the .303 [[Lee\u2013Enfield]]. Issues with kit were eventually solved, new lightweight uniforms were issued and the [[FN FAL]] rifle replaced the Lee\u2013Enfield. The Irish Battalions had a huge area to patrol and not much transport to patrol it with. Most patrols consisted of a couple of [[Land Rover]]s or [[Willys MB|Willys CJ3A]]s, carrying soldiers armed with rifles, [[Carl Gustaf M/45|Gustav M45]] submachineguns and [[Bren Gun]]s. One such patrol was ambushed at Niemba on 8 November 1960 by [[Baluba]] tribesmen. Of the 11 Irish soldiers, 9 were killed and only 2 escaped, while 25 Baluba were also killed in the battle. Trooper Anthony Browne was posthumously awarded the [[Military Medal for Gallantry]] (the highest Irish military award) for giving his life to save his comrade.<ref>{{cite book| last= Southern Command| title=Volume 26 |work=[[An Cosant\u00f3ir]] | year = 1966 |publisher= Army Authorities|location= Ireland| page = 254|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=St4iAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Browne+had+been+posthumously+awarded+the+Military+Medal+for+Gallantry%22&dq=%22Browne+had+been+posthumously+awarded+the+Military+Medal+for+Gallantry%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Yk4xT4rHOYinhAea5-jhBA&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA | volume = 26}}</ref> As a result of the ambush, the army equipped its contingent with 8 [[Ford]] armoured cars. These had been constructed in Ireland during the Second World War as a stop-gap armoured vehicle. Armament consisted of a single turret-mounted Vickers HMG. Modifications included extra ammunition storage, a searchlight and a cooling fan.\n\nThe most famous Irish action of the operation was the [[Siege of Jadotville]] where 150 Irish troops of \"A\" Company, 35th Battalion, held out against a much larger force of Katanga Gendarmerie. The Irish fought until their ammunition ran out, inflicting hundreds of casualties on their opponents while suffering only several wounded. However, an attempt by Irish and Swedish reinforcements to relieve them failed, and in the end, the besieged Irish troops were forced to surrender.\n\nA total of 6,000 Irish soldiers served in the Congo from 1960 until 1964, taking 26 casualties in that time. The Congo deployment resulted in greater investment by the government in personal kit and eventually, armoured personnel carriers.\n\n=== Canadian Army involvement ===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nWhen violence erupted in the Congo, Canada had set aside an infantry brigade especially for the use of the United Nations. When Dag Hammarskjold received the offer to send the Canadian Brigade to the Congo he refused stating that \"If outside help was required to resolve the developing crisis, they preferred non-African states to be used as a last resort.\" The United Nations did not wish to turn the Congo Crisis into a Cold War proxy war and so tried to pick peacekeepers from neutral countries. This trans-Atlantic French\u2013speaking country would be Canada, even though as Dr. Spooner put it \"Canada: [was] Just West of Neutral.\" Canadian forces were perfectly suited for a peacekeeping mission in the Congo because they were bilingual, this allowed them to communicate with the mostly English speaking UN troops as well as the French-speaking Belgian and Congolese forces. They could also communicate with the Congolese people.\n\nAll of this occurred prior to there being an official request for assistance from the Congo. The first request for assistance from the Congo requested that the United Nations send technical assistance to support the [[Force Publique]], the armed forces of the Congo. In response, \"the secretary general suggested the dispatch of UN technical personnel to the Congo to assist in restoring order and discipline within the armed forces.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Spooner |first=Kevin A. |date=2010 |title=Canada, The Congo Crisis, and UN Peacekeeping |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWx6-ph9H1sC&dq=%22Once+cabinet+decided+to+send+signallers,+the+army+moved+quickly%22+Congo&source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=UBC Press |page=34 |isbn=9780774858953 |author-link= }}</ref> Canadian National Defence assumed that the United Nations would ask for French-speaking military advisers, the army maintained a standby list of one hundred officers, including many who were bilingual and could be posted abroad on short notice.\" Before Hammarskjold could put his plan into action, however, a second Congolese request arrived, sent directly to the secretary general from President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Prime Minister Joseph Lumumba, \"the Congolese leaders asked for UN military forces to counter the violent Belgian intervention.\" Again Canada offered combat troops stating that if the need arose for Canadian military intervention in the Congo Canada could also \"deploy one of three French speaking battalions made ready for UN Service.\" The offer for combat troops was again refused, though Hammarskjold officially accepted the Canadian French-speaking officers. Colonel [[Jean Berthiaume]] of the [[Royal 22e Regiment]] led the UN effort as the mission's first [[Chief of staff]].<ref>Spooner, Kevin A. 2009. \"Canada, the Congo crisis, and UN peacekeeping, 1960\u201364\", Vancouver, UBC Press, p.107</ref> Berthiaume was congratulated for his impressive organizational skills, but also for his bravery and for his \"initiative, linguistic ability, and special aptitude for negotiating. He became the first Canadian since the Korean War to become an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/42718/supplement/5183|work=London Gazette|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was during this time that the first formal request for troops in the support of the UN mission was given to Canada, the request included Canadian signals and logistics personnel be sent to the Congo. From Canada the UN needed specifically signals personnel as well as quartermaster and maintenance personnel. The Canadian Signallers were to be used to send communication from the front to the headquarters and vice versa. They were stationed both at ONUC HQ as well as in 10 static signals stations spread throughout the country. Canada also sent a Provost Unit which attempted to promote law and order in the capital. \"At any one time there were more Canadians serving at ONUC HQ than of any other nationality.\" In addition to the Signals Squadron, Canada also sent an advanced reconnaissance party consisting of six officers from the United Nations Military Observer Group in India. \"These men were instructed to determine personnel and equipment requirements, as well as the organization requirements at HQ.\" The reconnaissance party found that \"ONUC HQ personnel did not carry weapons and were able to move about freely without any trouble.\" The Canadian government, however, was scared that their French-speaking peacekeepers could get mistaken for Belgian paratroops, and so \"peacekeepers were given small arms training... depending on rank the troops were issued either [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning automatic pistols]] or [[Sterling submachine gun|C1 submachine guns]], weapons the non-combatant peacekeepers carried for personal defence only.\"\n\nIt soon became clear that these fears were not unwarranted, Canadian peacekeepers were attacked by Congolese troops on several occasions. \"The first incident of serious violence that occurred between Congolese and Canadians occurred at [[N'Djili Airport]], and demonstrated how vulnerable the Canadians could be. Two groups of peacekeepers were waiting to depart on reconnaissance missions, when those destined for Luluabourg were delayed on the tarmac. A patrol of about ten to twelve Congolese soldiers suddenly rushed them... the Congolese forced them facedown onto the tarmac, arms extended and then they kicked them.\" The commanding officer was then knocked out and the remaining Canadian soldiers were herded onto a truck. After about ten minutes the Canadians were rescued by a Danish officer and Ghanain troops. The UN as well as Canada reacted in outrage to this senseless attack against Canadian troops. In turn they praised the Canadian officer for not escalating the situation and responding in due discretion. It was recognized by all parties that the Canadian soldiers were capable of firing on the Congolese troops in self-defence but they did not.\n\nEven though Canada wasn't in the Congo in a combat capacity their involvement came under scrutiny from the USSR. The Soviets began to attack Canadian involvement directly, \"they objected to the use of Canadian peacekeepers because Canada was one of Belgium's NATO allies.\" The Soviets even went so far as to demand \"the withdrawal of armed groups from Canada\". According to Scarnecchia, the Soviets \"accused the RCAF of supplying weapons and armoured steel to Tshombe's forces in secessionist Katanga, they believed that this RCAF support was in line with Western Interests.\" Although these allegations were never proven, in response, the Secretary-General of the UN transferred the RCAF contingent from performing airlift duties in support of the UN mission to a Pisa-Leopoldville airlift of food and aid. This transfer served to somewhat satisfy the Russians and any further scrutiny was mild in comparison. Instead of arguing against UN involvement in the Congo, the Soviets began to provide aid to Prime Minister Lumumba in Leopoldville. Along with the assassination of Lumumba and the death of Secretary-General Hammarskjold, this then led to the use of force by UN troops in the Congo being allowed by the UN. In 1961, UN troops under aggressive commanders pushed into Katanga, and began routing Tshombe's armed forces. As \"clashes between Tshombe and UN forces grew more frequent, the UN moved even more aggressively, and eventually took control of key parts of the province.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lyman|first= Princeton N|date= Spring 2004|title= Ralph Bunche's International Legacy: The Middle East, Congo, and United Nations Peacekeeping|jstor= 3211272|journal= [[The Journal of Negro Education]]|volume= 73|issue= 2|pages= 163 of 159\u2013170 |doi= 10.2307/3211272}}</ref>\n\nCanadians would play an important role in nearly every aspect of the UN mission in the Congo, from their detachment at Command HQ to the RCAF Pisa-Leopoldville Airlift on to the Signals Personnel stationed throughout the Congo. Though Canadian involvement came under Soviet attack the Canadian commitment to the mission did not waver and Canadian soldiers stayed in the Congo until the end of the mission in 1964. Canadian forces proved themselves admirably in tough situations when they were attacked by Congolese forces and responded with discipline and tact by not firing on their attackers.\n\nThe greatest strength which the Canadian Contingent in the Congo reached was 461, though 1,900 Canadian soldiers would serve there from 1960\u201364. There were no casualties except the bruises and cuts given to the Canadian Forces by Congolese troops at N'Djili Airport.\n\nDuring the ensuing [[Congo Crisis]], about 1,800 Canadians from 1960 to 1964 served among the 93,000 predominantly African peacekeepers with the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC), working chiefly as communications signallers and delivering via the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] humanitarian food shipments and logistical support.<ref name=gaffen1987>Gaffen, Fred. 1987.

The mission was launched to help restore stability to the Congo after it fell into [[Congo Crisis|conflict and disorder]] following independence. ONUC was the UN's first peacekeeping mission with a significant military force. It was withdrawn in 1964.\n\nFollowing Security Council actions, the United Nations Organisation in the Congo was established.

While the President and the Prime Minister were trying to negotiate with the mutineers, the Belgian government decided to intervene to protect Belgians that remained in the country.

Following assurances that contingents of the Force would arrive in sufficient numbers, the Belgian authorities agreed to withdraw all their forces from the Leopoldville area by 23 July. The last Belgian troops left the country by 23 July, as United Nations forces continued to deploy throughout the Congo. The buildup continued, ONUC's strength increasing to over 8,000 by 25 July and to over 11,000 by 31 July 1960. A basic agreement between the United Nations and the Congolese Government on the operation of the Force was finalized by 27 July.\n\nOn 9 August 1960, Kalonji declared the region of south-eastern Kasai, on the Congo's southern border with [[Portuguese Angola]], to be the new Mining State of [[South Kasai]] (''\u00c9tat minier du Sud-Kasa\u00ef'') or Autonomous State of South Kasai (''\u00c9tat autonome du Sud-Kasa\u00ef'').{{sfn|Packham|1996|p=37}}{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=105}} The use of the word \"state\" (''\u00e9tat'') was deliberately ambiguous, allowing Kalonji to avoid specifying whether the South Kasai claimed to independence as a nation-state in imitation of Katanga, or as a province within the Congo.{{sfn|Le Potentiel|2008}} Due to rejection of requests to the UN for aid to suppress the South Kasai and Katanga revolts, the [[Lumumba Government]] decided to request Soviet assistance. De Witte writes that \"Leopoldville asked the Soviet Union for planes, lorries, arms, and equipment. ...Shortly afterwards, on 22 or 23 August, about 1,000 soldiers left for Kasai.\"<ref>De Witte, ''The Assassination of Lumumba'', 2001, 16</ref> De Witte goes on to write that on 26\u201327 August, the ANC seized [[Mbuji-Mayi|Bakwanga]], Albert Kalonji's capital in South Kasai, without serious resistance. \"In the next two days it temporarily put an end to the secession of Kasai.\"<ref>de Witte, 2001, 16.</ref>\n\nBloomfield wrote in 1963 that:<ref>Lincoln P.

While relationships with the ANC ([[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]]) were complicated by the latter's lack of responsible commanders at any level, in most instances the ANC during that first month did lay down arms wherever there were UN troops, and ONUC took over custody of arms, ammunition depots, and arsenals. Local UN commanders used their own judgment as to how to keep the Congolese troops under control, with outstanding success in many areas.</blockquote>\n\nBy February 1961, there were four factions in the Congo: [[Antoine Gizenga]] (leading Lumumba's followers), [[Joseph-Desire Mobutu]], Tshombe, and the self-appointed King [[Albert Kalonji]]. There were four separate armed forces: Mobotu's ANC itself, numbering about 12,000, the [[South Kasai]] Constabulary loyal to [[Albert Kalonji]] (3,000 or less), the [[Katanga Gendarmerie]] which were part of [[Moise Tshombe]]'s regime (totalling about 10,000), and the Stanleyville dissident ANC loyal to [[Antoine Gizenga]] (numbering about 8,000).<ref>Gordon McDonald et al., ''U.S. Army Area Handbook for the Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville)'' [issued by the Foreign Area Studies Division of American University], June 1962, p. 620.</ref>\n\n=== 1961 ===\nEarly in 1961, Patrice Lumumba was assassinated. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] reacted sharply. Calling it \u201can international crime of the first magnitude\u201d, he asked Hammarskj\u00f6ld to take a tough line. When the Security Council passed a second resolution on 21 February 1961, Nehru agreed to send an [[Indian Army]] brigade of some 4,700 troops to the Congo.<ref name=\"livemint.com\">https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/9D5XT497AEYYluFn3moa2H/When-Indian-troops-entered-Congo-55-years-ago.html</ref> Thus United Nations mission was strengthened and expanded in response, in an effort to keep foreign mercenaries out of country. In August of that year, three of the four groups claiming control of the country, Lumumba, Mobutu and Kalonji, reconciled with help from the United Nations.<ref name=\":1\" /> It resulted in the restoration of the country's parliament and prevented the outbreak of a large civil war. Tshombe's breakaway Katanga province was not part of this reconciliation. United Nations forces clashed with Tshombe's foreign mercenaries several times late in the year.\n\nOn 17 September 1961, UN Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]] was flying to [[Rhodesia]] to negotiate peace talks between the government and Tshombe [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|when Hammarskj\u00f6ld's plane crashed]], killing him.<ref name=\":1\" /> It was a response to the troubled Operation Morthor ongoing at the time.

Removing Tshombe from Katanga became the primary military objective for the UN.{{citation needed|date= December 2016}} In December 1961, UN troops from Sweden, Ireland, India, and Ethiopia were involved in heavy fighting for Katanga's capital, Elizabethville. UN forces eventually managed to defeat the Katangan gendarmes in the city and took Elizabethville. During the fighting, eleven Swedish soldiers were taken prisoner; they were released on 15 January 1962 in exchange for Katangan gendarmes.\n\nIn August 1961, under the command of [[Indian Army]]'s Brigadier-General KAS Raja, the UN launched Operation Rumpunch, a surprise attack that led to the peaceful surrender of 81 foreign mercenaries.\n\n=== Operation Morthor ===\n[[File:United Nations peacekeeping air forces in Congo - January 1963.jpg|thumbnail|right|United Nations peacekeeping forces of [[Kingdom of Iran|Iran]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Sweden]] in [[Kamina Air Base]], January 1963]]\n\nOn 13 September 1961, the most obvious example of the transition from peacekeeping to peace enforcement occurred when the [[India]]n ONUC leadership on the ground leading an Indian brigade, launched \"Operation Morthor\" ([[Hindi]]: smash and grab) and swiftly took control of Katanga. The operation was meant to be a stepped up version of the earlier Operation Rumpunch. It has been said that Secretary-General Hammarskj\u00f6ld did not know the operation was happening. However, it is now clear that he had prior knowledge of the operation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Peace Enforcement: The United Nations Experience in Congo, Somalia, and Bosnia|last = Boulden|first = Jane|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|year = 2001|isbn = 9780275969066|location = |pages = 35\u201337|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7-_TiwKXJkcC&pg=PA35&dq=Operation+Morthor#v=onepage&q=Operation%20Morthor&f=false|access-date = 14 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe operation led to a serious eight-day military engagement between ONUC and the Katangese forces. Tshombe's paid mercenaries were prepared for the UN forces and launched an effective counterattack.<ref name=\":0\" /> Seven UN troops were killed as well as 200 Katangese civilians and troops. Operation Morthor was executed with Indian support, but without full approval by several member countries of the UN, particularly the UK, France, and United States. The Soviet Union was angrily accusing the US of supporting the assassination of Lumumba, a Soviet ally, and of installing American ally Mobutu as president. The Soviet state interpreted ONUC to now be acting as a proxy for the US rather than supporting the interests of the entire Security Council.<ref>Bellamy, Alex J., Paul Williams, and Stuart Griffin. ''Understanding Peacekeeping''. Cambridge, UK: Polity, 2010.</ref>\n\nDuring the fighting, a UN spokesperson accounted that the Katanga secession movement was over. Most observers interpreted that as meaning that the UN military forces had successfully defeated Tshombe's troops, but the announcement was premature in every possible way.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the operation, a company of 156 Irish UN troops was attacked by Moise Tshombe's forces in Katanga. The Irish were seriously outnumbered and outgunned, but managed to hold out for six days until they finally ran out of ammunition. The Irish managed to inflict heavy losses against Tshombe's foreign mercenaries, without any of their own being [[Killed in action|killed]] themselves. This event is known as the [[Siege of Jadotville]].\n\n=== End of the Katangan secession ===\n{{main|Operation Grandslam}}\n[[File:Swedish UN troops in Congo. Major Sture Fagerstr\u00f6m, orients his platoon leaders before the attack on Kaminaville in Katanga, Congo 1963.jpg|225px|thumb|Swedish troops plan offensive actions for Operation Grandslam]]\n\nThe United Nations launched [[Operation Unokat]] in early December 1961, which put pressure on Tshombe to enter serious negotiations with Congolese Prime Minister [[Cyrille Adoula]]. On 21 December Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration, an agreement whereby he would recognize the authority of the central government and work to reintegrate Katanga into the Republic of the Congo.<ref name= boulden38>{{harvnb|Boulden|2001|p=38}}</ref> However, Tshombe subsequently deferred to the Katangan Parliament and put off any action of reconciliation. In January 1962 the rival government of the [[Free Republic of the Congo]] was finally subdued and the UN was able to refocus its efforts on ending the Katangan secession. By then contact between the central government and Katanga had broken down, and ONUC intelligence reports indicated that the latter was rebuilding its forces.<ref name= Mockaitis35>{{harvnb|Mockaitis|1999|p=35}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1962 Secretary General Thant drew up a \"Plan for National Reconciliation\" by which Katanga would rejoin a [[Federalism|federalized]] Congo. Adoula and Tshombe both accepted the proposal. Thant was wary of Tshombe's delaying tactics and applied increasing political pressure on the Katangan government to abide by the plan's timetable.<ref name= Mockaitis35/> Still doubting the likelihood of a peaceful resolution of the Katangan secession, he sent [[Ralph Bunche]] to [[L\u00e9opoldville]]. There, Bunch worked with local UN Mission Chief Robert Gardiner and UN Force Commander [[Sean MacEoin (general)|Sean MacEoin]] to create a plan to achieve freedom of movement for ONUC personnel and eliminate the foreign mercenaries. By then it was obvious that Tshombe did not intend on rejoining the Congo; there were 300\u2013500 mercenaries in Katanga (as many as there had been before previous UN operations) and new airfields and defensive positions were being constructed. ONUC personnel and even consuls from troop-contributing supporters of ONUC faced increasing harassment at the hands of Katangan forces.<ref name= Mockaitis36>{{harvnb|Mockaitis|1999|p=36}}</ref>\n\nThe situation came to a breaking point on 24 December 1962 when Katangan gendarmes brazenly attacked peacekeeping forces in Katanga, causing Thant to authorize a retaliatory offensive to decisively eliminate secessionist opposition.<ref name= boulden39>{{harvnb|Boulden|2001|p=39}}</ref>\n\nMajor General [[Dewan Prem Chand]] launched Operation Grandslam on 28 December and by the end of the day UN troops had seized downtown \u00c9lisabethville.<ref name= Mockaitis36/> Reinforced by recently amassed air power, United Nations peacekeepers successfully completed the first phase of the operation by the end of the year. In early January the United Nations forces turned their attention towards remaining strongholds in southern Katanga. Indian peacekeepers surpassed their orders and crossed the [[Lufira River]] ahead of schedule, generating panic behind the Katangan lines and causing an incident among United Nations leadership.<ref name= Mockaitis37>{{harvnb|Mockaitis|1999|p=37}}</ref> Tshombe, realizing that his position was untenable, sued for peace on 15 January 1963. Two days later he signed an instrument of surrender and declared the Katangan secession to be over.\n\n=== Final activities ===\nAfter Operation Grandslam, the United Nations shrank the force significantly, only keeping a small peacekeeping force in the country.\n\nBy autumn 1963 plans were underway to remove the United Nations force from the Congo after the reincorporation of Katanga.<ref>Arthur House, ''The UN in the Congo: The Civilian Operations'', University Press of America, 1978, p. 166.</ref> At that time six battalions of UN troops were stationed in Katanga, one battalion was at [[Luluabourg (city)|Luluabourg]], one at Force Headquarters, and administration personnel were at [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]].\n\nCanadian Brigadier-General [[Jacques Dextraze]] was sent to the Congo in 1963, to serve as mission Chief of Staff, effectively deputy to the mission's military commander. The military component headquarters, coordinated by Dextraze, was in the process of planning the mission's withdrawal in early 1964 as the [[Simba rebellion]] loomed.<ref name=DextrazeK>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMDHWWp6hdUC&pg=PA310&dq=Dextraze+ONUC+Kwilu&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2-Z7ju6TRAhWhJsAKHehQDVcQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=Dextraze%20ONUC%20Kwilu&f=false|title=Warrior Chiefs: Perspectives on Senior Canadian Military Leaders|last=Horn|first=Bernd|last2=Harris|first2=Stephen John|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Dundurn|year=|isbn=9781550023510|location=|pages=310\u2013311|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> Dextraze launched a small-scale operation during [[Pierre Mulele]]'s [[Kwilu Province]] uprising of January 1964 in order to save at least some of the threatened aid workers and missionaries under attack from the ''jeunesse''.\n \nIn May 1964 troops began to withdraw, beginning with the Irish unit in Kolwezi on 11 May, and ending with units in Leopoldville in June. The United Nations also maintained a large civilian staff of 2000 experts in the country throughout 1963 and 1964.<ref name=\":1\" /> The final group of peacekeepers, 85 men of the First Nigerian Battalion and 58 men of the 57th Canadian Signals, departed Ndjili Airport in Leopoldville on 30 June.

Lumumba assassination shocked Nehru who reacted sharply. Calling it \u201can international crime of the first magnitude\u201d, he asked Hammarskj\u00f6ld to take a tough line. When the Security Council passed a second resolution on 21 February 1961, Nehru agreed to send an Indian Army brigade of some 4,700 troops to the Congo. Kasavubu and Mobutu took great exception to these moves. They had all along resented Dayal's and Nehru's support for Lumumba. Now they threatened dire consequences for the UN mission if Dayal remained at its helm. At Hammarskj\u00f6ld's request, Nehru agreed that Dayal should step down.\n\nYet, the Indian involvement was set to escalate. On 13 September, the Indian brigade launched Operation Morthor (Hindi: twist and break) that swiftly took control of Katanga. The staff officer who planned the operation would later become the chief of the Indian Army: Major K.S. Sundarji. It was in this context that the British government sought to arrange that fateful meeting between Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Tshombe in Ndola, ostensibly to negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nOn the eve of Operation Rum Punch the UN had 5,720 troops in Katanga; there were 1,600 Indians, 500 Irish, and 400 Swedes in \u00c9lisabethville, 1,200 Indians in Albertville, 1,000 Indians at Kamina Base, 500 Indians at Kabalo, 400 Ethiopians and Indians in Manono, and 120 Irish in Jadotville.\n\nNehru doubled down on his support for the UN in Congo. India sent more troops than any country and these men were active throughout 1962 in stubbing out the secessionist forces, Indian Army units leading the fight. The UN forces were commanded by Indian officers including Major General [[Dewan Prem Chand]]. Even during the war with China, Nehru did not insist on an immediate withdrawal of the Indian brigade, but the Canberra bombers that it had deployed, were called back. The troops returned only after the mission was completed in March 1963.<ref name=\"livemint.com\"/>\n\n=== Malayan Army involvement ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nMalaya (now [[Malaysia]]) was invited to send a contingent to serve in ONUC. The Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] Putra, in response to the United Nations' request offered a force of 120 men in a telegram to the Secretary-General on 4 August 1960. On 24 August, in another telegram to New York, the force level was increased to 450 men. Eventually, the force level was settled at 613 all ranks. The name given to this force for service with ONUC was Malayan Special Force or MSF in short. The original force was drawn from two of the finest units in the Federation Army - 4th Battalion, the [[Royal Malay Regiment]] and 'C' Squadron 2nd Reconnaissance Regiment (now 2 Armour). It had a complement of 42 officers and 571 other ranks.\n\n=== Swedish Armed involvement ===\n[[File:Congo Crisis Swedish Soldiers.jpg|thumb|Swedish UN soldiers armed with sub machine guns at one of the access roads to [[Niemba]] in November 1961.]]\nSweden had an active role in the UN forces during the crisis. When Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld established UN Mission ONUC he organized it into two parts: one military and one civilian. The Swedish Major General [[Carl von Horn (1903\u20131989)|Carl von Horn]] became the head of the military part and the Swedish diplomat Sture Linn\u00e9r was responsible for the civilians.<ref name=\"theses.lub.lu.se\">{{cite web |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=1325876&fileOId=1325877 |publisher=[[Lund University]], Department of Political Science |title=Kongokrisen - FN-insatsen 1960-64 i analys |trans-title=Congo Crisis - Analysis of the UN mission in 1960-64 |first1=Thomas |last1=Nilsson |first2=Jimmy |last2=Persson |page=10 |date=2006 |access-date=20 April 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Both of them were subject to American [[Ralph Bunche]], who was appointed head of the whole operation.\n\n==== Air Force ====\nIn September 1961, in response to an appeal by the [[United Nations]] (UN) for military support, an initial force of five [[Saab 29 Tunnan|J 29Bs]] were stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Republic of Congo]] as a contribution to a UN peacekeeping mission ([[ONUC]]) in the region, organized as the F 22 Wing of the [[Swedish Air Force]].<ref name=\"widf\">{{cite book|last1=Widfeldt|first1=Bo|title=The Saab J 29|date=1966|publisher=Profile Publications Ltd.|location=Leatherhead, Surrey, UK| page=9}}</ref> It was subsequently reinforced by four more J 29Bs and two S 29C photo reconnaissance Tunnans in 1962. The J 29 was the only combat aircraft at the disposal of the UN, the J 29Bs dispatched receiving the UN identifying legend upon their fuselages.<ref name = \"widf\"/>\n\nMost of the missions involved attacking ground targets with internal cannons as well as unguided rockets. No aircraft were lost in action despite large amounts of [[Anti-aircraft artillery|ground fire]]. Consensus of the crews and foreign observers was that the Tunnan's capabilities were exceptional.<ref>[http://www.avrosys.nu/aircraft/Jakt/118J29.htm \"J 29 - SAAB 29 \u201dFlygande tunnan\u201d (1951-1976).\"] ''avrosys.nu.''

The only aircraft lost was by a high-ranking officer who made a trial run and crashed during an aborted takeoff.

He therefore requested that Sweden and Ireland would send a battalion each, with the ulterior motive that they would more easily win the confidence of the whites than soldiers from African states. The first Swedish battalion arrived in Congo directly from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] 22 July 1960. The first days the Swedes were patrolling in Leopoldville and guarded [[N'djili Airport|Kinshasa Airport]] in the city.\n\nSwedes, like other UN troops, had difficulty knowing who really were friends and who were enemies, and the fighting they engaged in did not always have an apparent rational reason. In August, the Swedes moved to Elizabethville in Katanga, where they ended up in their first combat situation and suffered their first loss in connection with the escort of a rail road transport. The trains, which were carrying Katangan [[Baluba]] prisoners, were attacked by Baluba, a nationalist group who supported the central government against the break out government. In practice, at that point, the Swedes fought on the same side as the Belgian-led Katangan gendarmerie, who would later become the UN's worst enemy.\n\nThe Swedes had to try to maintain order in a huge camp with approximately 40,000 Baluba refugees in Kasai which was suddenly formed in just two weeks in 1961, with refugees fleeing Gendarmerie attacks in north Katanga.<ref name=\"Stendahl (2014)\"/> In 1962, the Swedes moved to the Kamina base, near the town of [[Kamina]].

Issues with kit were eventually solved, new lightweight uniforms were issued and the [[FN FAL]] rifle replaced the Lee\u2013Enfield. The Irish Battalions had a huge area to patrol and not much transport to patrol it with. Most patrols consisted of a couple of [[Land Rover]]s or [[Willys MB|Willys CJ3A]]s, carrying soldiers armed with rifles, [[Carl Gustaf M/45|Gustav M45]] submachineguns and [[Bren Gun]]s. One such patrol was ambushed at Niemba on 8 November 1960 by [[Baluba]] tribesmen. Of the 11 Irish soldiers, 9 were killed and only 2 escaped, while 25 Baluba were also killed in the battle. Trooper Anthony Browne was posthumously awarded the [[Military Medal for Gallantry]] (the highest Irish military award) for giving his life to save his comrade.<ref>{{cite book| last= Southern Command| title=Volume 26 |work=[[An Cosant\u00f3ir]] | year = 1966 |publisher= Army Authorities|location= Ireland| page = 254|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=St4iAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Browne+had+been+posthumously+awarded+the+Military+Medal+for+Gallantry%22&dq=%22Browne+had+been+posthumously+awarded+the+Military+Medal+for+Gallantry%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Yk4xT4rHOYinhAea5-jhBA&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA | volume = 26}}</ref> As a result of the ambush, the army equipped its contingent with 8 [[Ford]] armoured cars. These had been constructed in Ireland during the Second World War as a stop-gap armoured vehicle. Armament consisted of a single turret-mounted Vickers HMG. Modifications included extra ammunition storage, a searchlight and a cooling fan.\n\nThe most famous Irish action of the operation was the [[Siege of Jadotville]] where 150 Irish troops of \"A\" Company, 35th Battalion, held out against a much larger force of [[Katanga Gendarmerie]]. The Irish fought until their ammunition ran out, inflicting hundreds of casualties on their opponents while suffering only several wounded. However, an attempt by Irish and Swedish reinforcements to relieve them failed, and in the end, the besieged Irish troops were forced to surrender.\n\nA total of 6,000 Irish soldiers served in the Congo from 1960 until 1964, taking 26 casualties in that time. The Congo deployment resulted in greater investment by the government in personal kit and eventually, armoured personnel carriers.\n\n=== Canadian Army involvement ===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nWhen violence erupted in the Congo, Canada had set aside an infantry brigade especially for the use of the United Nations. When Dag Hammarskjold received the offer to send the Canadian Brigade to the Congo he refused stating that \"If outside help was required to resolve the developing crisis, they preferred non-African states to be used as a last resort.\" The United Nations did not wish to turn the Congo Crisis into a Cold War proxy war and so tried to pick peacekeepers from neutral countries. This trans-Atlantic French\u2013speaking country would be Canada, even though as Dr. Spooner put it \"Canada: [was] Just West of Neutral.\" Canadian forces were perfectly suited for a peacekeeping mission in the Congo because they were bilingual, this allowed them to communicate with the mostly English speaking UN troops as well as the French-speaking Belgian and Congolese forces. They could also communicate with the Congolese people.\n\nAll of this occurred prior to there being an official request for assistance from the Congo. The first request for assistance from the Congo requested that the United Nations send technical assistance to support the [[Force Publique]], the armed forces of the Congo. In response, \"the secretary general suggested the dispatch of UN technical personnel to the Congo to assist in restoring order and discipline within the armed forces.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Spooner |first=Kevin A. |date=2010 |title=Canada, The Congo Crisis, and UN Peacekeeping |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWx6-ph9H1sC&dq=%22Once+cabinet+decided+to+send+signallers,+the+army+moved+quickly%22+Congo&source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=UBC Press |page=34 |isbn=9780774858953 |author-link= }}</ref> Canadian National Defence assumed that the United Nations would ask for French-speaking military advisers, the army maintained a standby list of one hundred officers, including many who were bilingual and could be posted abroad on short notice.\" Before Hammarskjold could put his plan into action, however, a second Congolese request arrived, sent directly to the secretary general from President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Prime Minister Joseph Lumumba, \"the Congolese leaders asked for UN military forces to counter the violent Belgian intervention.\" Again Canada offered combat troops stating that if the need arose for Canadian military intervention in the Congo Canada could also \"deploy one of three French speaking battalions made ready for UN Service.\" The offer for combat troops was again refused, though Hammarskjold officially accepted the Canadian French-speaking officers. Colonel [[Jean Berthiaume]] of the [[Royal 22e Regiment]] led the UN effort as the mission's first [[Chief of staff]].<ref>Spooner, Kevin A. 2009. \"Canada, the Congo crisis, and UN peacekeeping, 1960\u201364\", Vancouver, UBC Press, p.107</ref> Berthiaume was congratulated for his impressive organizational skills, but also for his bravery and for his \"initiative, linguistic ability, and special aptitude for negotiating. He became the first Canadian since the Korean War to become an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/42718/supplement/5183|work=London Gazette|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was during this time that the first formal request for troops in the support of the UN mission was given to Canada, the request included Canadian signals and logistics personnel be sent to the Congo. From Canada the UN needed specifically signals personnel as well as quartermaster and maintenance personnel. The Canadian Signallers were to be used to send communication from the front to the headquarters and vice versa. They were stationed both at ONUC HQ as well as in 10 static signals stations spread throughout the country. Canada also sent a Provost Unit which attempted to promote law and order in the capital. \"At any one time there were more Canadians serving at ONUC HQ than of any other nationality.\" In addition to the Signals Squadron, Canada also sent an advanced reconnaissance party consisting of six officers from the United Nations Military Observer Group in India. \"These men were instructed to determine personnel and equipment requirements, as well as the organization requirements at HQ.\" The reconnaissance party found that \"ONUC HQ personnel did not carry weapons and were able to move about freely without any trouble.\" The Canadian government, however, was scared that their French-speaking peacekeepers could get mistaken for Belgian paratroops, and so \"peacekeepers were given small arms training... depending on rank the troops were issued either [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning automatic pistols]] or [[Sterling submachine gun|C1 submachine guns]], weapons the non-combatant peacekeepers carried for personal defence only.\"\n\nIt soon became clear that these fears were not unwarranted, Canadian peacekeepers were attacked by Congolese troops on several occasions. \"The first incident of serious violence that occurred between Congolese and Canadians occurred at [[N'Djili Airport]], and demonstrated how vulnerable the Canadians could be. Two groups of peacekeepers were waiting to depart on reconnaissance missions, when those destined for Luluabourg were delayed on the tarmac. A patrol of about ten to twelve Congolese soldiers suddenly rushed them... the Congolese forced them facedown onto the tarmac, arms extended and then they kicked them.\" The commanding officer was then knocked out and the remaining Canadian soldiers were herded onto a truck. After about ten minutes the Canadians were rescued by a Danish officer and Ghanain troops. The UN as well as Canada reacted in outrage to this senseless attack against Canadian troops. In turn they praised the Canadian officer for not escalating the situation and responding in due discretion. It was recognized by all parties that the Canadian soldiers were capable of firing on the Congolese troops in self-defence but they did not.\n\nEven though Canada wasn't in the Congo in a combat capacity their involvement came under scrutiny from the USSR. The Soviets began to attack Canadian involvement directly, \"they objected to the use of Canadian peacekeepers because Canada was one of Belgium's NATO allies.\" The Soviets even went so far as to demand \"the withdrawal of armed groups from Canada\". According to Scarnecchia, the Soviets \"accused the RCAF of supplying weapons and armoured steel to Tshombe's forces in secessionist Katanga, they believed that this RCAF support was in line with Western Interests.\" Although these allegations were never proven, in response, the Secretary-General of the UN transferred the RCAF contingent from performing airlift duties in support of the UN mission to a Pisa-Leopoldville airlift of food and aid. This transfer served to somewhat satisfy the Russians and any further scrutiny was mild in comparison. Instead of arguing against UN involvement in the Congo, the Soviets began to provide aid to Prime Minister Lumumba in Leopoldville. Along with the assassination of Lumumba and the death of Secretary-General Hammarskjold, this then led to the use of force by UN troops in the Congo being allowed by the UN. In 1961, UN troops under aggressive commanders pushed into Katanga, and began routing Tshombe's armed forces. As \"clashes between Tshombe and UN forces grew more frequent, the UN moved even more aggressively, and eventually took control of key parts of the province.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lyman|first= Princeton N|date= Spring 2004|title= Ralph Bunche's International Legacy: The Middle East, Congo, and United Nations Peacekeeping|jstor= 3211272|journal= [[The Journal of Negro Education]]|volume= 73|issue= 2|pages= 163 of 159\u2013170 |doi= 10.2307/3211272}}</ref>\n\nCanadians would play an important role in nearly every aspect of the UN mission in the Congo, from their detachment at Command HQ to the RCAF Pisa-Leopoldville Airlift on to the Signals Personnel stationed throughout the Congo. Though Canadian involvement came under Soviet attack the Canadian commitment to the mission did not waver and Canadian soldiers stayed in the Congo until the end of the mission in 1964. Canadian forces proved themselves admirably in tough situations when they were attacked by Congolese forces and responded with discipline and tact by not firing on their attackers.\n\nThe greatest strength which the Canadian Contingent in the Congo reached was 461, though 1,900 Canadian soldiers would serve there from 1960\u201364. There were no casualties except the bruises and cuts given to the Canadian Forces by Congolese troops at N'Djili Airport.\n\nDuring the ensuing [[Congo Crisis]], about 1,800 Canadians from 1960 to 1964 served among the 93,000 predominantly African peacekeepers with the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC), working chiefly as communications signallers and delivering via the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] humanitarian food shipments and logistical support.<ref name=gaffen1987>Gaffen, Fred. 1987.

It is a [[Toggle switch|toggle key]]: each press reverses its action. Some keyboards also implement a light, to give visual feedback about whether it is on or off. Exactly what Caps Lock does depends on the keyboard hardware, the [[operating system]], the [[device driver]], and the [[keyboard layout]]. Usually, the effect is limited to letter keys; letters of Latin-based scripts are capitalized, while letters of other texts (e.g. [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Hindi]]) and non-letter characters are generated normally.\n\n== History{{anchor|Shift}}==\nThe Caps Lock key originated as a '''Shift lock''' key on mechanical [[typewriters]]. An early innovation in typewriters was the introduction of a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the [[Typewriter#Shift key|typewriter's Shift key]] caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically ''shifting'' the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.\n\nThe Shift lock key was introduced so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and were meant to be pressed by the [[little finger]], it could be difficult to hold the shift down for more than two or three consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the Shift lock key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMechanical typewriter shift lock is typically set by pushing both Shift and lock at the same time, and released by pressing Shift by itself. Computer Caps Lock is set and released by the same key, and the Caps Lock behavior in most [[QWERTY]] keyboard layouts differs from the Shift lock behavior in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the [[Commodore 64]], had a Shift lock but no Caps Lock; others, such as the [[BBC Micro]], had both, only one of which could be enabled at a time.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Abolition===\nThere are some proposals to abolish the caps-lock key as being obsolete.<ref name=Wired2006 /><ref name=Medium2019>Daniel Colin James, [https://medium.com/forwardtick/its-time-for-caps-lock-to-die-81c9eaa4dfa7 It\u2019s time for Caps Lock to die]\", ''Medium'', May 24, 2019.

Retrieved July 14, 2019.</ref><ref name=diaz2010 />\n\nIn fact, the current German keyboard layout standard [[German keyboard layout|DIN 2137]]-01:2018-12 specifies the function of the key as optional, to be replaced by other keys or key combinations. It recommends the function only to be invoked when it is pressed simultaneously with the [[Ctrl key]], while otherwise it acts as a \u201cleft [[AltGr key]]\u201d, thus enabling [[Touch typing|touch typists]] to access all key combinations using AltGr without using two fingers of the same hand, which is considered to be an [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] advantage. As a side effect, any inadvertent pressing of this key without pressing another key simultaneously has no effect.\n\n== Behavior ==\n[[File:AppleCapsLock.jpg|thumb|right|Caps Lock on an [[Apple keyboard]]. The green LED on the key is lit, indicating that Caps Lock is on.]]\nTypical Caps Lock behavior is that pressing the key sets an [[mode (user interface)|input mode]] in which all typed letters are [[capital letter|uppercase]], if applicable. The keyboard remains in Caps Lock mode and would generate [[all caps]] text until the key is pressed again. Keyboards often include a small [[LED]] to indicate that Caps Lock is active, either on the key itself or in a dedicated indicators area, where [[Scroll lock]] and [[Num lock]] indicators are also located. On the original [[IBM PC keyboard]], this LED was exclusively controlled by the keyboard. Since the introduction of [[IBM AT]], however, it is under control of the operating system. Small keyboards, such as [[netbook]] keyboards, forgo the indicators to conserve space, instead providing software that gives an on-screen or audio feedback.\n\nIn most cases, the status of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys, not that of any other key. [[Microsoft Windows]] enforces this behavior only when a keyboard layout for a Latin-based script is active, e.g. the \"English (United States)\" layout but not the \"Persian\" layout. However, on certain non-QWERTY keyboard layouts, such as the [[Keyboard layout#AZERTY|French AZERTY]] and the [[Keyboard layout#QWERTZ|German QWERTZ]], Caps Lock still behaves like a traditional Shift lock, i.e., the keyboard behaves as if the [[Shift key]] is held down, causing the keyboard to input the alternative values of the keys; example the \"5\" key generates a \"%\" when Caps lock is pressed. This is not true for the layout \"German (IBM)\".\n\nDepending on the keyboard layout used, the [[Shift key]], when pressed in combination with a Latin-based letter button while Caps Lock is already on, is either ignored, or reverses the effect of Caps Lock, so that typed characters are in [[lowercase]] again. Microsoft Windows enforces the latter. RISC OS offers both \u2013 CapsLock alone chooses the former, Shift-CapsLock the latter.\n\nWhile the typical locking behavior on keyboards with Caps Lock key is that of a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode,{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in Shift lock mode.\n\nSome keyboard drivers{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} include a configuration option to deactivate the Caps Lock key. This behavior allows users to decide themselves whether they want to use the key, or to disable it to prevent accidental activation.\n\nIn the [[Unix]] communities of the [[Post-Soviet states|ex-USSR countries]], Caps Lock key is traditionally used as input language switcher, convenient for usage with [[touch typing]]. Support for this is present in [[KDE]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://debback.blogspot.com/2008/04/kde.html |title=\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 Debian GNU Linux: \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0432 KDE - \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435, \u0442\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0430! |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=June 28, 2014}}</ref> [[GNOME]] and other desktop environments.

In the first version for PC/XT, Caps Locks was located to the bottom right of the letter keys area. However, subsequent models switched the places of the Caps Lock key and the [[Control key]]. As such, Caps Lock has since been placed on left edge of the keyboard, above the [[Shift key]] and below the [[Tab key]], next to letter A. This layout has become the ''de facto'' popular standard.\n\nThe keyboards of some early [[computer terminal]]s, including the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR and [[Lear-Siegler]] [[ADM-3A]], the [[Apple II]] and a few [[Apple Keyboard]] models retained the Control key where PC/XT first had it; Caps Lock was either absent on these device or was placed elsewhere. This layout was preserved for later [[workstation]] systems and is often associated with [[Unix]] workstations. Keyboards from [[Sun Microsystems]] came in two layouts; \"Unix\" and \"PC-style\", with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys.<ref>[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-6642/806-6642.pdf Sun hardware reference manual]</ref> The [[Amiga]] computers all had both the Control key and Caps Lock key in this spot at half the width.\n\nSome users of keyboards with Caps Lock on the left remap the keys to exchange Control and Caps Lock, finding the traditional location more [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] for using programs benefiting from use of the Control key.

It is a [[Toggle switch|toggle key]]: each press reverses its action. Some keyboards also implement a light, to give visual feedback about whether it is on or off. Exactly what Caps Lock does depends on the keyboard hardware, the [[operating system]], the [[device driver]], and the [[keyboard layout]]. Usually, the effect is limited to letter keys; letters of Latin-based scripts are capitalized, while letters of other texts (e.g. [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]], [[Hindi]]) and non-letter characters are generated normally.\n\n== History{{anchor|Shift}}==\nThe Caps Lock key originated as a '''Shift lock''' key on mechanical [[typewriters]]. An early innovation in typewriters was the introduction of a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the [[Typewriter#Shift key|typewriter's Shift key]] caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically ''shifting'' the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.\n\nThe Shift lock key was introduced so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and were meant to be pressed by the [[little finger]], it could be difficult to hold the shift down for more than two or three consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the Shift lock key was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMechanical typewriter shift lock is typically set by pushing both Shift and lock at the same time, and released by pressing Shift by itself. Computer Caps Lock is set and released by the same key, and the Caps Lock behavior in most [[QWERTY]] keyboard layouts differs from the Shift lock behavior in that it capitalizes letters but does not affect other keys, such as numbers or punctuation. Some early computer keyboards, such as the [[Commodore 64]], had a Shift lock but no Caps Lock; others, such as the [[BBC Micro]], had both, only one of which could be enabled at a time.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Abolition===\nThere are some proposals to abolish the caps-lock key as being obsolete.<ref name=Wired2006 /><ref name=Medium2019>Daniel Colin James, [https://medium.com/forwardtick/its-time-for-caps-lock-to-die-81c9eaa4dfa7 It\u2019s time for Caps Lock to die]\", ''Medium'', May 24, 2019.

It recommends the function only to be invoked when it is pressed simultaneously with the [[Ctrl key]], while otherwise it acts as a \u201cleft [[AltGr key]]\u201d, thus enabling [[Touch typing|touch typists]] to access all key combinations using AltGr without using two fingers of the same hand, which is considered to be an [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] advantage. As a side effect, any inadvertent pressing of this key without pressing another key simultaneously has no effect.\n\n== Behavior ==\n[[File:AppleCapsLock.jpg|thumb|right|Caps Lock on an [[Apple keyboard]]. The green LED on the key is lit, indicating that Caps Lock is on.]]\nTypical Caps Lock behavior is that pressing the key sets an [[mode (user interface)|input mode]] in which all typed letters are [[capital letter|uppercase]], if applicable. The keyboard remains in Caps Lock mode and would generate [[all caps]] text until the key is pressed again. Keyboards often include a small [[LED]] to indicate that Caps Lock is active, either on the key itself or in a dedicated indicators area, where [[Scroll lock]] and [[Num lock]] indicators are also located. On the original [[IBM PC keyboard]], this LED was exclusively controlled by the keyboard. Since the introduction of [[IBM AT]], however, it is under control of the operating system. Small keyboards, such as [[netbook]] keyboards, forgo the indicators to conserve space, instead providing software that gives an on-screen or audio feedback.\n\nIn most cases, the status of the Caps Lock key only changes the meaning of the alphabet keys, not that of any other key. [[Microsoft Windows]] enforces this behavior only when a keyboard layout for a Latin-based script is active, e.g. the \"English (United States)\" layout but not the \"Persian\" layout. However, on certain non-QWERTY keyboard layouts, such as the [[Keyboard layout#AZERTY|French AZERTY]] and the [[Keyboard layout#QWERTZ|German QWERTZ]], Caps Lock still behaves like a traditional Shift lock, i.e., the keyboard behaves as if the [[Shift key]] is held down, causing the keyboard to input the alternative values of the keys; example the \"5\" key generates a \"%\" when Caps lock is pressed. This is not true for the layout \"German (IBM)\".\n\nDepending on the keyboard layout used, the [[Shift key]], when pressed in combination with a Latin-based letter button while Caps Lock is already on, is either ignored, or reverses the effect of Caps Lock, so that typed characters are in [[lowercase]] again. Microsoft Windows enforces the latter. RISC OS offers both \u2013 CapsLock alone chooses the former, Shift-CapsLock the latter.\n\nWhile the typical locking behavior on keyboards with Caps Lock key is that of a toggle, each press reversing the shift state, some keyboard layouts implement a combi mode,{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} where pressing a Shift key in Caps Lock mode will also release the Caps Lock mode, just as it typically happens in Shift lock mode.\n\nSome keyboard drivers{{Example needed|date=December 2018}} include a configuration option to deactivate the Caps Lock key. This behavior allows users to decide themselves whether they want to use the key, or to disable it to prevent accidental activation.\n\nIn the [[Unix]] communities of the [[Post-Soviet states|ex-USSR countries]], Caps Lock key is traditionally used as input language switcher, convenient for usage with [[touch typing]].
