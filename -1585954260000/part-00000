Residents stockpiled goods, large conferences were cancelled, a state of emergency was declared, and all public universities and colleges switched to online classes. After the first case of community spread was found on March 14, Utah faced a shortage of testing kits, and public schools were ordered closed. Community spread was confirmed in more counties, and the state issued a public health order prohibiting dine-in service in restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 individuals except in grocery stores.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.

Drum-shaped with a 42-inch (1.1&nbsp;m) diameter, and height of 19inches (48&nbsp;cm), the TIROS satellite carried two six-inch (15&nbsp;cm) long television cameras. One of the cameras had a [[wide-angle lens]] with an {{f/|1.6}} [[aperture]] that could view an 800-mile-wide area of the Earth. The other camera had a [[telephoto lens]] with an {{f/|1.8}} aperture and 10- to 12-power magnification{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} compared to the wide angle camera.\n\nThe satellite itself was stabilized in its orbit by spinning like a [[gyroscope]]. When it first separated from the rocket's third stage, it was spinning at about 136 revolutions per minute (rpm). To take [[Motion blur|unblurred photographs]], a de-spin mechanism slowed the satellite down to 12&nbsp;rpm after the orbit was achieved.\n\nThe camera [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] made possible the series of still pictures that were stored and transmitted back to earth via 2-watt FM transmitters as the satellite approached one of its ground command points. After transmission, the tape was erased or cleaned and readied for more recording.\n\n== Series ==\n[[File:TIROS, ESSA, ITOS, NOAA.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing progression of meteorological satellites from TIROS I to TIROS-N]]\n\nTIROS continued as the more advanced TIROS Operational System (TOS), and eventually was succeeded by the Improved TIROS Operational System (ITOS) or TIROS-M, and then by the TIROS-N and Advanced TIROS-N series of satellites.

Drum-shaped with a 42-inch (1.1&nbsp;m) diameter, and height of 19inches (48&nbsp;cm), the TIROS satellite carried two six-inch (15&nbsp;cm) long television cameras. One of the cameras had a [[wide-angle lens]] with an {{f/|1.6}} [[aperture]] that could view an 800-mile-wide area of the Earth. The other camera had a [[telephoto lens]] with an {{f/|1.8}} aperture and 10- to 12-power magnification{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} compared to the wide angle camera.\n\nThe satellite itself was stabilized in its orbit by spinning like a [[gyroscope]]. When it first separated from the rocket's third stage, it was spinning at about 136 revolutions per minute (rpm). To take [[Motion blur|unblurred photographs]], a de-spin mechanism slowed the satellite down to 12&nbsp;rpm after the orbit was achieved.\n\nThe camera [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] made possible the series of still pictures which were stored and transmitted back to earth via 2-watt FM transmitters as the satellite approached one of its ground command points. After transmission, the tape was erased or cleaned and readied for more recording.\n\n== Series ==\n[[File:TIROS, ESSA, ITOS, NOAA.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing progression of meteorological satellites from TIROS I to TIROS-N]]\nTIROS continued as the more advanced TIROS Operational System (TOS), and eventually was succeeded by the Improved TIROS Operational System (ITOS) or TIROS-M, and then by the TIROS-N and Advanced TIROS-N series of satellites.

From 1922 until [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]]s took their seats in 1927, the Labour Party was the major [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] party in the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]].

O'Brien left with six TDs in 1944, founding the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]], whose leader was [[James Everett]]. O'Brien also withdrew ITGWU from the Irish Trades Unions Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the [[1944 Irish general election|1944 general election]]. It was only after Larkin's death in 1947 that an attempt at unity could be made.\n\nAfter the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]] National Labour had five TDs \u2013 Everett, [[Dan Spring]], [[James Pattison (Irish politician)|James Pattison]], [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]] and [[John O'Leary (Wexford politician)|John O'Leary]]. National Labour and Labour (with 14 TDs) both entered the First Inter-Party Government, with the leader of National Labour becoming [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]]. In 1950, the National Labour TDs rejoined the Labour Party.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments (the largest being [[Fine Gael]]). William Norton, the Labour Party leader, became [[T\u00e1naiste]] on both occasions. During the First Inter-Party Government he served as [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social Welfare]], while during the Second Inter-Party Government he served as [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Industry and Commerce]].

The coalition partners lost the subsequent [[1977 Irish general election|1977 general election]], and Corish resigned immediately after the defeat.\n\n===Late 1970s and 1980s: Coalition, internal feuding, electoral decline and regrowth===\nIn 1977, shortly after the election defeat, members grouped around the Liaison Committee for the Labour Left split from Labour and formed the short-lived [[Socialist Labour Party (Ireland)|Socialist Labour Party]]. From 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, the Labour Party participated in coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country's poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of [[government spending]], and the Labour Party bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in [[Health care|health]] and other [[public services]]. The nadir for the Labour party was the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]] where it received only 6.4% of the vote. Its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the Marxist and more radical [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], particularly in Dublin. Fianna F\u00e1il formed a [[minority government]] from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the [[Progressive Democrats]].\n\nThe 1980s saw fierce disagreements between the left and right wings of the party. The more radical elements, Labour Left, led by such figures as [[Emmet Stagg]], [[Sam Nolan]], Frank Buckley and [[Helena Sheehan]], and Militant Tendency, led by [[Joe Higgins]], opposed the idea of Labour entering into coalition government with either of the major [[centre-right]] parties (Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sam Nolan: A Long March on the Left|last=Kenny|first=Brian|publisher=Personal History Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Navigating the Zeitgeist|last=Sheehan|first=Helena|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> At the 1989 Labour Party conference in [[Tralee]] a number of [[socialism|socialist]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] activists, organised around the [[Militant Tendency (Ireland)|Militant Tendency]] and their internal newspaper, were expelled.

Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from [[Douglas Hyde]], that a non-[[Fianna F\u00e1il]] candidate was elected.\nIn 1990 [[Limerick East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick East]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[Jim Kemmy]]'s [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] merged into the Labour Party, and in 1992 [[Sligo\u2013Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013Leitrim]] TD [[Declan Bree]]'s Independent Socialist Party also joined the Labour Party (in May 2007 Declan Bree resigned from the Labour Party over differences with the Leadership).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/82596 |title=Declan Bree resigns from Labour |publisher=Indymedia.ie |date=16 May 2007|accessdate=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|last=Bree |first=Declan |url=http://www.declanbree.com/news-currentissues/2007/5/16/declan-bree-resigns-from-labour-party.html |title=DECLAN BREE RESIGNS FROM LABOUR PARTY |publisher=Declanbree.com |date= |accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>)\n\nAt the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] the Labour Party won a record 19.3% of the first preference votes, more than twice its share in the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 general election]]. The party's representation in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|the D\u00e1il]] doubled to 33 seats and, after a period of negotiations, the Labour Party formed a coalition with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], taking office in January 1993 as the [[23rd Government of Ireland]]. Fianna F\u00e1il leader [[Albert Reynolds]] remained as [[Taoiseach]], and Labour Party leader [[Dick Spring]] became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].\n\nAfter less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], [[Harry Whelehan]], as president of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]]. The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna F\u00e1il's loss of two seats in [[1995 Wicklow by-election|by-elections in June]], where the Labour Party itself had performed disastrously. On the pretext that the Labour Party voters were not happy with involvement with Fianna F\u00e1il, Dick Spring withdrew his support for Reynolds as Taoiseach. The Labour Party negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 [[Fine Gael]], the Labour Party, and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] governed in the [[24th Government of Ireland]]. Dick Spring became T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs again.\n\n===Merger with Democratic Left===\nThe Labour Party presented the [[1997 Irish general election|1997 general election]], held just weeks after spectacular electoral victories for the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as the first-ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right; but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and lost half of its TDs. Labour's losses were so severe that while Fine Gael gained seats, it still came up well short of the support it needed to keep Bruton in office. This, combined with a poor showing by Labour Party candidate [[Adi Roche]] in the subsequent election for [[President of Ireland]], led to Spring's resignation as party leader.\n\nIn 1997 [[Ruairi Quinn]] became the new Labour Party leader. Following negotiations in 1999 the Labour Party merged with [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]], keeping the name of the larger partner. This had been previously opposed by the former leader Dick Spring. Members of Democratic Left in Northern Ireland were invited to join the Irish Labour Party but not permitted to organise.<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/steven-king-on-thursday-13764190.html Steven King on Thursday], Steven King, ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 17 December 1998</ref>\nThis left Gerry Cullen, their councillor in Dungannon Borough Council, in a state of [[limbo]]; he had been elected for a party he could no longer seek election for.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg93.htm |title=The 1993 Local Government Elections in Northern Ireland |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe launch was held in the Pillar Room of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lanson Kelly |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/01/25/ihead.htm |title=Red rose shapes up to future by Liam O'Neill |publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date=25 January 1999 |accessdate=1 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030527185717/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/01/25/ihead.htm |archivedate=27 May 2003 }}</ref>\n\nQuinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the [[2002 Irish general election|2002 general election]]. Former Democratic Left TD [[Pat Rabbitte]] became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.\n\nIn the [[2004 European Parliament election in Ireland|2004 elections]] to the [[European Parliament]], [[Proinsias De Rossa]] retained his seat for the Labour Party in the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency. This was the Labour Party's only success in the election. In the [[2004 Irish local elections|local elections]] held the same day, the Labour Party won over 100 county council seats, the first time ever in its history, and emerged as the largest party in Dublin city and Galway city.\n\n===2007 general election and aftermath===\n{{Social democracy sidebar|sp=uk}}\nPrior to the 2004 local elections, Party Leader Pat Rabbitte had endorsed a mutual transfer pact with Fine Gael leader [[Enda Kenny]]. Rabbitte proposed the extension of this strategy, named \"the [[Mullingar]] Accord\" after a meeting between Rabbitte and Kenny in the [[County Westmeath]] town, at the 2005 Labour Party National Conference.\n\nRabbitte's strategy was favoured by most TDs, notably Deputy Leader [[Liz McManus]], [[Eamon Gilmore]]\u2014who had proposed a different electoral strategy in the 2002 leadership election\u2014and former opponent of coalition [[Emmet Stagg]]. Opposition to the strategy came from [[Brendan Howlin]], [[Kathleen Lynch (politician)|Kathleen Lynch]] and [[Tommy Broughan]] (who is regarded as being on the party's left wing and who advocated closer co-operation with the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/labour-rift-ahead-of-leader-vote-1066296.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Labour rift ahead of leader vote | date=26 August 2007}}</ref> who opposed the boost that would be given to Fine Gael in such a strategy and stated their preference for an independent campaign. Outside the PLP, organised opposition to the pact came from [[Labour Youth]] and the [[Transport and General Workers' Union|ATGWU]], who opposed the pact on political and tactical grounds. Nevertheless, the strategy proposed by Rabbitte was supported by approximately 80% of conference delegates.\n\nIn the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 general election]] the Labour Party failed to increase its seat total and had a net loss of 1 seat, returning with 20 seats. Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] and independents did not have enough seats to form a government. Pat Rabbitte resisted calls to enter negotiations with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] on forming a government. Eventually, Fianna F\u00e1il entered government with the [[Progressive Democrats]] and the Green Party with the support of independents.\n\nOn 23 August 2007 Rabbitte resigned as Labour Party leader. He stated that he took responsibility for the outcome of the recent general election, in which his party failed to gain new seats and failed to replace the outgoing government.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 [[Eamon Gilmore]] was unanimously elected leader of the Labour Party, being the only nominee after Pat Rabbitte's resignation.\n\n===2009 local and European elections===\nAt the [[2009 Irish local elections|local elections]] of 5 June 2009, the Labour Party added to its total of council seats, with 132 seats won (+31) and gained an additional two seats from councillors joining the party since the election. On [[Dublin City Council]], the party was again the largest party, but now with more seats than the two other main parties combined. The Labour Party's status as the largest party on both [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]] councils was also improved by seat gains.\n\nAt the [[2009 European Parliament election in Ireland|2009 European Parliament election]] held on the same day, the Labour Party increased its number of seats from one to three, retaining the seat of [[Proinsias De Rossa]] in the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin constituency]], while gaining seats in the [[East (European Parliament constituency)|East constituency]] with [[Nessa Childers]], and in the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South constituency]] with [[Alan Kelly (politician)|Alan Kelly]]. This was the first time since the 1979 European Parliament Elections that Labour equalled the number of seats held in Europe by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.electionsireland.org/results/europe/1979euro.cfm|title=Elections Ireland: 1979 European Election|website=www.electionsireland.org}}</ref>\n\n===2011 Government and decline in support===\n[[File:Eamon Gilmore Conference 2010 cropped.jpg|thumb|Former Labour Party leader, [[Eamon Gilmore]]]]\nOn 11 June 2010, a poll by MRBI was published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' which, for the first time in the history of the state, showed the Labour Party as the most popular, at 32%, ahead of Fine Gael at 28% and Fianna F\u00e1il at 17%.

Members who are elected to parliamentary positions (D\u00e1il, Seanad, European Parliament) form the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). The party's decision-making bodies on a national level formally include the Executive Board (formerly known as the National Executive Committee), Labour Party Conference and Central Council. The Executive Board has responsibility for organisation and finance, with the Central Council being responsible for policy formation \u2013 although in practice the Parliamentary leadership has the final say on policy. The Labour Party Conference debates motions put forward by branches, constituency councils, party members sections and affiliates. Motions set principles of policy and organisation but are not generally detailed policy statements.\n\nFor many years Labour held to a policy of not allowing residents of Northern Ireland to apply for membership, instead supporting the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP). The National Conference approved the establishment of a Northern Ireland Members Forum but it has not agreed to contest elections there.\n\nAs a party with a constitutional commitment to [[democratic socialism]]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.ie/party/constitution.html |title=Party Constitution |publisher=Labour.ie |date=20 May 2009|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref> founded by trade unions to represent the interests of [[working class]] people, Labour's link with unions has always been a defining characteristic of the party. Over time this link has come under increasing strain, with most craft based unions based in the public sector and [[Irish Congress of Trades Unions]] having disaffiliated since the 1950s. The remaining affiliated unions are primarily private sector [[general union]]s. Currently affiliated unions still send delegates to the National Conference in proportion to the size of their membership. Recent{{when|date=July 2017}} constitutional changes mean that in future, affiliated unions will send delegations based on the number of party members in their organisation.\n\n===Sections===\nWithin the Labour Party there are different sections:\n*[[Labour Youth]]\n*[[Labour Women]]\n*Labour Trade Unionists\n*Labour [[Councillor]]s\n*Labour Equality (this section also includes groups such as Labour LGBT)\n*Labour Disability\n\n==Affiliates==\nThe Irish Labour Party constitution makes provision for both Trade Unions and Socialist Societies to affiliate to the party. There are currently seven Trade Unions affiliated to the Party:\n\n*Munster & District Graphical Society\n*[[F\u00f3rsa]] (Municipal Employees Division)\n*[[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] (RMT)\n*[[GMB (trade union)|General, Municipal and Boilermakers' Union]] (GMB)\n*Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union ([[SIPTU]])\n*[[Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union]] (BFWAU)\n*[[Transport Salaried Staffs Association]] (TSSA)\n\nSocialist Societies Affiliated to the Party:\n*Labour Party Lawyers Group\n*Association of Labour Teachers\n*Labour Social Services Group\n\n==Leadership==\n\n===Party leader===\n{{main|Leader of the Labour Party (Ireland)}}\nThe following are the terms of office as party leader and as T\u00e1naiste:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The party has served as a partner in [[coalition government]]s on seven occasions since its formation: six times in coalition either with [[Fine Gael]] alone or with Fine Gael and other smaller parties, and once with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. This gives Labour a cumulative total of nineteen years served as part of a government, the second-longest total of any party in the [[Republic of Ireland]] after Fianna F\u00e1il.

O'Brien left with six TDs in 1944, founding the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]], whose leader was [[James Everett]]. O'Brien also withdrew ITGWU from the Irish Trades Unions Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the [[1944 Irish general election|1944 general election]]. It was only after Larkin's death in 1947 that an attempt at unity could be made.\n\nAfter the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]] National Labour had five TDs \u2013 Everett, [[Dan Spring]], [[James Pattison (Irish politician)|James Pattison]], [[James Hickey (Irish politician)|James Hickey]] and [[John O'Leary (Wexford politician)|John O'Leary]]. National Labour and Labour (with 14 TDs) both entered the First Inter-Party Government, with the leader of National Labour becoming [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]]. In 1950, the National Labour TDs rejoined the Labour Party.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments (the largest being [[Fine Gael]]). William Norton, the Labour Party leader, became [[T\u00e1naiste]] on both occasions. During the First Inter-Party Government he served as [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social Welfare]], while during the Second Inter-Party Government he served as [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Industry and Commerce]].

From 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, the Labour Party participated in coalition governments with [[Fine Gael]]. In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country's poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of [[government spending]], and the Labour Party bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in [[Health care|health]] and other [[public services]]. The nadir for the Labour party was the [[1987 Irish general election|1987 general election]] where it received only 6.4% of the vote. Its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the Marxist and more radical [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], particularly in Dublin. Fianna F\u00e1il formed a [[minority government]] from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the [[Progressive Democrats]].\n\nThe 1980s saw fierce disagreements between the left and right wings of the party. The more radical elements, Labour Left, led by such figures as [[Emmet Stagg]], [[Sam Nolan]], Frank Buckley and [[Helena Sheehan]], and Militant Tendency, led by [[Joe Higgins]], opposed the idea of Labour entering into coalition government with either of the major [[centre-right]] parties (Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sam Nolan: A Long March on the Left|last=Kenny|first=Brian|publisher=Personal History Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Navigating the Zeitgeist|last=Sheehan|first=Helena|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> At the 1989 Labour Party conference in [[Tralee]] a number of [[socialism|socialist]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] activists, organised around the [[Militant Tendency (Ireland)|Militant Tendency]] and their internal newspaper, were expelled. These expulsions continued during the early 1990s and those expelled, including Joe Higgins, went on to found the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]].\n\n===1990s: Growing political influence and involvement===\nIn 1990 [[Mary Robinson]] became the first [[President of Ireland]] to have been proposed by the Labour Party, although she contested the election as an independent candidate, she had resigned from the party over her opposition to the [[Anglo Irish Agreement]]. Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from [[Douglas Hyde]], that a non-[[Fianna F\u00e1il]] candidate was elected.\nIn 1990 [[Limerick East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Limerick East]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[Jim Kemmy]]'s [[Democratic Socialist Party (Ireland)|Democratic Socialist Party]] merged into the Labour Party, and in 1992 [[Sligo\u2013Leitrim (D\u00e1il constituency)|Sligo\u2013Leitrim]] TD [[Declan Bree]]'s Independent Socialist Party also joined the Labour Party (in May 2007 Declan Bree resigned from the Labour Party over differences with the Leadership).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/82596 |title=Declan Bree resigns from Labour |publisher=Indymedia.ie |date=16 May 2007|accessdate=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|last=Bree |first=Declan |url=http://www.declanbree.com/news-currentissues/2007/5/16/declan-bree-resigns-from-labour-party.html |title=DECLAN BREE RESIGNS FROM LABOUR PARTY |publisher=Declanbree.com |date= |accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>)\n\nAt the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]] the Labour Party won a record 19.3% of the first preference votes, more than twice its share in the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 general election]]. The party's representation in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|the D\u00e1il]] doubled to 33 seats and, after a period of negotiations, the Labour Party formed a coalition with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], taking office in January 1993 as the [[23rd Government of Ireland]]. Fianna F\u00e1il leader [[Albert Reynolds]] remained as [[Taoiseach]], and Labour Party leader [[Dick Spring]] became [[T\u00e1naiste]] and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].\n\nAfter less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]], [[Harry Whelehan]], as president of the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]]. The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna F\u00e1il's loss of two seats in [[1995 Wicklow by-election|by-elections in June]], where the Labour Party itself had performed disastrously. On the pretext that the Labour Party voters were not happy with involvement with Fianna F\u00e1il, Dick Spring withdrew his support for Reynolds as Taoiseach. The Labour Party negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 [[Fine Gael]], the Labour Party, and [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]] governed in the [[24th Government of Ireland]]. Dick Spring became T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs again.\n\n===Merger with Democratic Left===\nThe Labour Party presented the [[1997 Irish general election|1997 general election]], held just weeks after spectacular electoral victories for the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as the first-ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right; but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and lost half of its TDs. Labour's losses were so severe that while Fine Gael gained seats, it still came up well short of the support it needed to keep Bruton in office. This, combined with a poor showing by Labour Party candidate [[Adi Roche]] in the subsequent election for [[President of Ireland]], led to Spring's resignation as party leader.\n\nIn 1997 [[Ruairi Quinn]] became the new Labour Party leader. Following negotiations in 1999 the Labour Party merged with [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]], keeping the name of the larger partner. This had been previously opposed by the former leader Dick Spring. Members of Democratic Left in Northern Ireland were invited to join the Irish Labour Party but not permitted to organise.<ref>[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/steven-king-on-thursday-13764190.html Steven King on Thursday], Steven King, ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 17 December 1998</ref>\nThis left Gerry Cullen, their councillor in Dungannon Borough Council, in a state of [[limbo]]; he had been elected for a party he could no longer seek election for.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/flg93.htm |title=The 1993 Local Government Elections in Northern Ireland |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe launch was held in the Pillar Room of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lanson Kelly |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/01/25/ihead.htm |title=Red rose shapes up to future by Liam O'Neill |publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date=25 January 1999 |accessdate=1 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030527185717/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1999/01/25/ihead.htm |archivedate=27 May 2003 }}</ref>\n\nQuinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the [[2002 Irish general election|2002 general election]]. Former Democratic Left TD [[Pat Rabbitte]] became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.\n\nIn the [[2004 European Parliament election in Ireland|2004 elections]] to the [[European Parliament]], [[Proinsias De Rossa]] retained his seat for the Labour Party in the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] constituency. This was the Labour Party's only success in the election. In the [[2004 Irish local elections|local elections]] held the same day, the Labour Party won over 100 county council seats, the first time ever in its history, and emerged as the largest party in Dublin city and Galway city.\n\n===2007 general election and aftermath===\n{{Social democracy sidebar|sp=uk}}\nPrior to the 2004 local elections, Party Leader Pat Rabbitte had endorsed a mutual transfer pact with Fine Gael leader [[Enda Kenny]]. Rabbitte proposed the extension of this strategy, named \"the [[Mullingar]] Accord\" after a meeting between Rabbitte and Kenny in the [[County Westmeath]] town, at the 2005 Labour Party National Conference.\n\nRabbitte's strategy was favoured by most TDs, notably Deputy Leader [[Liz McManus]], [[Eamon Gilmore]]\u2014who had proposed a different electoral strategy in the 2002 leadership election\u2014and former opponent of coalition [[Emmet Stagg]]. Opposition to the strategy came from [[Brendan Howlin]], [[Kathleen Lynch (politician)|Kathleen Lynch]] and [[Tommy Broughan]] (who is regarded as being on the party's left wing and who advocated closer co-operation with the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/labour-rift-ahead-of-leader-vote-1066296.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Labour rift ahead of leader vote | date=26 August 2007}}</ref> who opposed the boost that would be given to Fine Gael in such a strategy and stated their preference for an independent campaign. Outside the PLP, organised opposition to the pact came from [[Labour Youth]] and the [[Transport and General Workers' Union|ATGWU]], who opposed the pact on political and tactical grounds. Nevertheless, the strategy proposed by Rabbitte was supported by approximately 80% of conference delegates.\n\nIn the [[2007 Irish general election|2007 general election]] the Labour Party failed to increase its seat total and had a net loss of 1 seat, returning with 20 seats. Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] and independents did not have enough seats to form a government. Pat Rabbitte resisted calls to enter negotiations with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] on forming a government. Eventually, Fianna F\u00e1il entered government with the [[Progressive Democrats]] and the Green Party with the support of independents.\n\nOn 23 August 2007 Rabbitte resigned as Labour Party leader. He stated that he took responsibility for the outcome of the recent general election, in which his party failed to gain new seats and failed to replace the outgoing government.\n\nOn 6 September 2007 [[Eamon Gilmore]] was unanimously elected leader of the Labour Party, being the only nominee after Pat Rabbitte's resignation.\n\n===2009 local and European elections===\nAt the [[2009 Irish local elections|local elections]] of 5 June 2009, the Labour Party added to its total of council seats, with 132 seats won (+31) and gained an additional two seats from councillors joining the party since the election. On [[Dublin City Council]], the party was again the largest party, but now with more seats than the two other main parties combined. The Labour Party's status as the largest party on both [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]] councils was also improved by seat gains.\n\nAt the [[2009 European Parliament election in Ireland|2009 European Parliament election]] held on the same day, the Labour Party increased its number of seats from one to three, retaining the seat of [[Proinsias De Rossa]] in the [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin constituency]], while gaining seats in the [[East (European Parliament constituency)|East constituency]] with [[Nessa Childers]], and in the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South constituency]] with [[Alan Kelly (politician)|Alan Kelly]]. This was the first time since the 1979 European Parliament Elections that Labour equalled the number of seats held in Europe by either Fianna F\u00e1il or Fine Gael.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.electionsireland.org/results/europe/1979euro.cfm|title=Elections Ireland: 1979 European Election|website=www.electionsireland.org}}</ref>\n\n===2011 Government and decline in support===\n[[File:Eamon Gilmore Conference 2010 cropped.jpg|thumb|Former Labour Party leader, [[Eamon Gilmore]]]]\nOn 11 June 2010, a poll by MRBI was published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' which, for the first time in the history of the state, showed the Labour Party as the most popular, at 32%, ahead of Fine Gael at 28% and Fianna F\u00e1il at 17%.

Members who are elected to parliamentary positions (D\u00e1il, Seanad, European Parliament) form the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). The party's decision-making bodies on a national level formally include the Executive Board (formerly known as the National Executive Committee), Labour Party Conference and Central Council. The Executive Board has responsibility for organisation and finance, with the Central Council being responsible for policy formation \u2013 although in practice the Parliamentary leadership has the final say on policy. The Labour Party Conference debates motions put forward by branches, constituency councils, party members sections and affiliates. Motions set principles of policy and organisation but are not generally detailed policy statements.\n\nFor many years Labour held to a policy of not allowing residents of Northern Ireland to apply for membership, instead supporting the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP). The National Conference approved the establishment of a Northern Ireland Members Forum but it has not agreed to contest elections there.\n\nAs a party with a constitutional commitment to [[democratic socialism]]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.ie/party/constitution.html |title=Party Constitution |publisher=Labour.ie |date=20 May 2009|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref> founded by trade unions to represent the interests of [[working class]] people, Labour's link with unions has always been a defining characteristic of the party. Over time this link has come under increasing strain, with most craft based unions based in the public sector and [[Irish Congress of Trades Unions]] having disaffiliated since the 1950s. The remaining affiliated unions are primarily private sector [[general union]]s. Currently affiliated unions still send delegates to the National Conference in proportion to the size of their membership. Recent{{when|date=July 2017}} constitutional changes mean that in future, affiliated unions will send delegations based on the number of party members in their organisation.\n\n===Sections===\nWithin the Labour Party there are different sections:\n*[[Labour Youth]]\n*[[Labour Women]]\n*Labour Trade Unionists\n*Labour [[Councillor]]s\n*Labour Equality (this section also includes groups such as Labour LGBT)\n*Labour Disability\n\n==Affiliates==\nThe Irish Labour Party constitution makes provision for both Trade Unions and Socialist Societies to affiliate to the party. There are currently seven Trade Unions affiliated to the Party:\n\n*Munster & District Graphical Society\n*[[F\u00f3rsa]] (Municipal Employees Division)\n*[[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] (RMT)\n*[[GMB (trade union)|General, Municipal and Boilermakers' Union]] (GMB)\n*Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union ([[SIPTU]])\n*[[Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union]] (BFWAU)\n*[[Transport Salaried Staffs Association]] (TSSA)\n\nSocialist Societies Affiliated to the Party:\n*Labour Party Lawyers Group\n*Association of Labour Teachers\n*Labour Social Services Group\n\n==Leadership==\n\n===Party leader===\n{{main|Leader of the Labour Party (Ireland)}}\nThe following are the terms of office as party leader and as T\u00e1naiste:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

She also seeks answers about her past and the conflict between Luke and his nephew Kylo Ren. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey starts using the Force to communicate with Ren. Meanwhile, Leia leads Poe, Finn, [[Rose Tico]], BB-8, and the rest of the Resistance as they are pursued by the First Order, led by Snoke with Kylo as his second in command. After hearing Ren's perspective, Rey disagrees with Luke and leaves him in an attempt to redeem Kylo and achieve peace. In doing this, Rey unwittingly helps Kylo kill Snoke. However, Ren's intentions are to replace Snoke as Supreme Leader, believing that destroying the Jedi and the Resistance is the only way to achieve peace. Rey must choose between Kylo's offer to rule the galaxy with him, or helping the outnumbered Resistance survive on Crait.\n\nIn late 2012, it was reported that Lawrence Kasdan and [[Simon Kinberg]] would write and produce Episodes ''VIII'' and ''IX''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-lawrence-kasdan-simon-393459|title=J.J.

At age 4, Calandrelli started playing the piano by ear and started taking lessons at age 8.\n\nIn his late teens, with both of his parents' support, Calandrelli traveled to Europe to pursue a career in music. He arrived in [[Los Angeles]] in 1968 and collaborated with composer and arranger [[Clare Fischer]]. Inspired by him, Calandrelli decided to go back to Argentina and continue honing his skills.\n\nHe would later return to the United States with recommendation letters from the record labels we had worked with in Argentina. Soon, he recorded Russian-American conductor [[Andre Kostelanetz]] and a 65-piece orchestra at [[CBS]]' studio in [[New York City|New York]].\n\nCalandrelli soon started arranging for different artists, achieving a wider recognition in [[23rd Annual Grammy Awards|1981]] with first [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella|Best Instrumental Arrangement]] for his work on \"Forget the Woman\" by [[Eddie Daniels]].

It is host to many and varied societies, and has student bars situated around [[Albertopolis]]. The Union is based in the north wing of the [[Beit Quadrangle]] on [[Prince Consort Road]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Union Building, Beit Quadrangle from Kensington Gore.jpg|thumb|Union Building from Kensington Gore]]\nThe establishment of a students' union was recognised with the construction of the north building of Beit Quad in 1910-11 designed by [[Sir Aston Webb]]. The original idea for the building came from [[Arthur Dyke Acland|Sir Arthur Acland]], a member of the governing body, who saw the need for a place for students to congregate and develop a collegiate social life.<ref>[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/centenary/timeline/1910.shtml]</ref>\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{{prose|date=September 2013}}\n* 1907 Formation of Imperial College of Science and Technology incorporating the [[Royal School of Mines]], the [[Royal College of Science]] and [[City and Guilds College]]\n* 1907 Imperial College Union formed as a federation of the 3 College Unions\n* 1911 The Union building in South Kensington is constructed\n* 1922 Founder member of NUS (leaves for the first time in 1923)\n* 1949 [[Felix (newspaper)]] is founded\n* 1969 First directly elected sabbatical President <ref>See [[Felix (newspaper)|Felix]] issues of {{cite web|url=http://felixonline.co.uk/archive/IC_1969/1969_0274_A.pdf|title = 6 March 1969}}and {{cite web|url=http://felixonline.co.uk/archive/IC_1969/1969_0275_A.pdf|title = 20 March 1969}}</ref>\n* 1984 The Union starts catering operation\n* 1985 The Union Starts running own bars\n* 1987 First professional welfare advisor at the Union\n* 1988 Imperial College School of Medicine is established at St. Mary\u2019s\n* 1996 Union Council is made the supreme governing body\n* 1997 Union stops running bookshop on campus.\n* 1997 First medical student to be elected President (Andrew Heeps)<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Heeps|url=https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/trustee-profiles/andy-heeps|publisher=imperialcollegeunion.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n* 1998 First Deputy President (Education & Welfare) Sabbatical\n* 1998 Imperial College School of Medicine merges with Charing Cross and Royal Postgraduate Medical schools\n* 2000 Merger with Wye College and Kennedy Institute\n* 2001 Sir Richard Sykes appointed Rector of Imperial College\n* 2003 College adopts Faculty structure in place of constituent Colleges.\n* 2004 College rebrands as \"Imperial College, London\"\n* 2005 Union Building Redevelopment - Project starts\n* 2005 First Deputy President(Graduate Students) at the Union.\n* 2006 Union Building Redevelopment - Construction work starts\n* 2007 Imperial College Centenary\n* 2007 The Union rejoins the NUS (again)\n* 2007 Imperial College leaves the University of London\n* 2008 The Union leaves the NUS\n* 2009 First Deputy President (Education) and Deputy President (Welfare)\n\n=== Relationship with the NUS ===\nImperial College Union is most noted for the history of its relationship with the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. Despite being involved in the founding of the NUS in 1922, Imperial College Union withdrew its membership of the NUS a year later{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Since then, Imperial College Union has spent long periods outside the NUS, interspersed with brief periods of membership. A referendum for NUS affiliation held in 2002 was overwhelmingly rejected by members of the Imperial College Union.\n\nIn November 2006, after a petition proposed a debate to affiliate with NUS at [[Orientation week|Freshers' Fair]] 2006 collected 617 valid signatures, from just above the 5% minimum of Imperial College Union members necessary to call a referendum [http://live.cgcu.net/news/1290], a referendum was held between Tuesday 14th and Thursday 16 November 2006. The result of this referendum, which had a record turnout of over 30%, was a yes to NUS affiliation by 53.26% for to 46.74% against.\n\nAfter the failure of governance reform measures supported by Imperial College Union at the NUS conference in 2008, the union council voted in favour of holding a referendum on disaffiliation from the NUS.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://live.cgcu.net/news/1769 |title=Live! - Council Calls NUS Referendum<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=31 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608213148/http://live.cgcu.net/news/1769 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The resulting referendum showed that the Members of Imperial College Union decided that their Union should no longer affiliate to the National Union of Students.\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe Union is controlled by a variety of democratically elected representatives who sit on Union committees, control Union resources and represent the views of students to the College and external bodies. The Union is led by officers who act as representatives to the 14,900 Union members. The most senior officers are the five [[sabbatical]] officers who work full-time for the Union on a variety of areas ranging from commercial services to campaigns and representation. These officers are supported by 35 full-time and up to 250 part-time staff, and the 2,600 elected officers of the Union's 320+ clubs and societies.\n\nIn 2013, the Union successfully registered as a charity.\n\n===Constituent Union Structure===\nThere are six [[Faculty (university)|constituent]] unions which run as constituent parts of the Union. These are largely historical in origin and retain many traditions, such as their names when most of the actual faculties now have different names. Some represent the students in their respective faculties: the [[City and Guilds College Union]] (for engineers), the [[Royal College of Science Union]] (for scientists) and the [[Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union]] (for medical students). They are all run by part-time officers elected from the student body, with the exception of the Medical Union President, who is an elected full-time sabbatical officer with a one-year tenure.\n\nIn 2002 the [[Royal School of Mines#RSM Student.27s Union|Royal School of Mines Union]] was absorbed into the [[City and Guilds College Union]] and became a clubs & societies committee. However, in 2012 after running autonomously from City and Guilds Union for many years, The Royal School of Mines regained its constituent union status, solely looking after the social aspects of its students.\n\nIn the same governance review of 2012, Silwood Park Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Association (representing all postgraduate students) also became a constituent union. The Silwood Park Union operates largely independently from the overall Union but has no part or full-time sabbatical leadership.\n\n== Clubs, volunteering projects and societies ==\nImperial College Union has a large number of student-led clubs, volunteering projects and societies (known as CSPs), with over 400 in total. Funding for CSPs at Imperial College Union is significant, taking up a sizeable portion of the Union's annual subvention provided by [[Imperial College London]], though many clubs supplement this with sponsorship from outside of the Union.\n\nCSPs at Imperial College Union are administered by the [https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/18-19/Clubs%2C_Societies_%26_Projects_Board Clubs, Societies' and Project Board], who deal with the majority of procedural issues and who are responsible for representing the clubs within their care to Imperial College Union. Clubs are then grouped and fall under smaller organisational boards (e.g. the Athletics Clubs Committee handles the sports clubs).\n\nExamples of notable student groups are [[InterVol|Project Nepal]] which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development in rural Nepal<ref>[http://felixonline.co.uk/archive/IC_2011/2011_1504_A.pdf Felix Online Archive, November 30 2011] Article on new Project Nepal group at Imperial College and partnership with InterVol. Retrieved 16 January 2012.</ref> and [[El Salvador Project|the El Salvador Project]], a construction based project in Central America.<ref>[http://www.elsalvadorproject.org.uk/2012/sponsors.html El Salvador Project Sponsors Page] El Salvador Project lists Imperial College Union as an official sponsor. Retrieved 16 January 2012.</ref> Other societies include sports-related societies, such as [[Imperial College Boat Club]] and [[Imperial College Gliding Club]]; music societies such as [https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/a-cappella Imperial College A Capella], under which [[The Techtonics]] won the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] in 2016; social societies such as the Imperial College Debating Society. Each department also has its own departmental society.\n\nCSPs are supported by a number of features, including 15 minibuses which are available for clubs to hire. Imperial College also owns a mountain hut in Snowdonia, Wales, which it lets clubs use free of charge.\n\n==Facilities==\n===Bars===\n[[File:Beit_Quad.jpg|thumb|The Union Building forms the northern side of [[Beit Quadrangle|Beit Quad]]. The Union Bar, 568, and Metric are on the ground floor]]\nThe main Union bars are located on the north side of the [[Beit Quadrangle]]. There are three:\n*FiveSixEight is a bar serving food, with large screens often showing sports events or popular music channels.\n*The Union Bar is a small wood-panelled bar, and has existed in its current form since 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/beit-venues/spaces/bars/the-union-bar|title=Beit Venues - The Union Bar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The bar has a large selection of [[real ale]] and claims to boast the largest collection of pewter [[tankards]] in Europe, with many dating back to the early 20th century. Each tankard represents an officer of one of the clubs and only the current or former club officers are allowed to use their club's tankards.\n*Metric is a nightclub which opened in November 2010. During term time, Metric often plays host to DJs or to live bands performing to the backdrop of an electronic lighting wall. During the summer Metric hosts some of the Proms Extra events (part of [[The Proms]]).\n\nFiveSightEight and The Union Bar are both [[Cask Marque]] Accredited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/news/beit-bars-receives-prestigious-cask-marque-award|title=Beit Bars Receives Prestigious Cask Marque award|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Union also runs the Reynolds Bar situated in [[Charing Cross Hospital]], largely frequented by the students of [[Imperial College School of Medicine]].  The bar was originally run by CXWSU for the [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School]].\n\nThe [[Silwood Park]] campus bar is operated by an external company, although students have pushed for a Union-run bar in recent years. The bar boasts [[Guinness]] and [[Stella Artois]] Cidre on tap and also has a small selection of bottled ales and ciders. Three flavors of [[crisps]] are available to feed hungry patrons. The bar television almost exclusively shows ''[[Big Bang Theory]]'', and there is a small stereo in the main room which students can hook up to their own musical collections if desired.\n\n===Theatre===\nImperial College Union has a theatre located in the [[Union Concert Hall (UCH)]] which is found on the second floor of the Main Union Building, Beit Quad. The majority of performances are put on by the student societies of Imperial College, ranging from serious drama through to Gilbert & Sullivan Marathons. The space is shared with the [[Imperial College Dramatic Society]] and Imperial Cinema and other student societies as a multipurpose space. The theatre has a fly tower with a selection of lighting and fly bars, the venue has lectriflex, DMX and sound & comms multicore installed throughout.\n\nIn the Summer of 2014 the Union Concert Hall underwent an extensive redevelopment after a grant was awarded to do so. In early 2015, the Dramatic Society installed a considerable amount of brand new cabling which will make the venue even more useful to anyone who wishes to use it.\n\n===Cinema===\nImperial College Union has a student run Cinema located in the Union Concert Hall, in [[Beit Hall]]. The Cinema is considered a club under the Arts & Entertainments Board, however provides a service to members and non-members.\n\nThe cinema is a professionally equipped cinema with a 33&nbsp;ft screen, Dolby Digital surround sound system, Kinoton (35mm) and Barco (Digital) projectors and seats up to 200. Pre-show advertisements are provided by [[Pearl & Dean]].\n\n===Redevelopment of the Union Building===\nAs of August 2006 \u00a32.2 million had been raised out of the total \u00a36 million required for the redevelopment of the Union wing of [[Beit Hall]]. All three phases of the building project were completed by 2011, including the full bar and nightclub refurbishment and moving the Union Gym to level 3 of the building.\n\n==Former ICU Presidents and Sabbatical Officers==\n\nNotable former sabbaticals include:\n* [[Piers Corbyn]], President 1969-70.\n* [[Trevor Phillips]], President 1975-77.\n* [[Christopher Fox, Baron Fox]], President 1980.\n* [[Pallab Ghosh]], Felix Editor 1983-84.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org Imperial College Union Website]\n\n{{Aldwych Group}}\n{{Imperial College London}}\n\n[[Category:Imperial College London|Union]]\n[[Category:Students' unions in London]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2013}}\n{{short description|Student's union of Imperial College London}}\n{{Infobox Students Union |\nname               = Imperial College Union |\nimage              = [[Image:Imperialcollegeunion.png|200px|Imperial College Union logo]]|\nmotto              = |\nestablished        = {{start date and age|1907}} |\ninstitution        = [[Imperial College London]] |\nsabbs = Abhijay Sood (President)<br />\nFifi Henry (DP Finance and Services)<br />\nThomas Fernandez-Debets (DP Clubs and Societies)<br />\nAshley Brooks (DP Education)<br />\nShervin Sabeghi (DP Welfare) <ref>[https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/]</ref> |\nlocation           = [[South Kensington]]<br>[[London]], {{postcode|SW|7}} |\nmembers            = {{circa}} 17,000 total |\n\nfree               = |\nhomepage           = [http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/ www.imperialcollegeunion.org] |\n}}\n'''Imperial College Union''' is the [[Students' Union|students' union]] of [[Imperial College London]].

The original idea for the building came from [[Arthur Dyke Acland|Sir Arthur Acland]], a member of the governing body, who saw the need for a place for students to congregate and develop a collegiate social life.<ref>[http://www.imperial.ac.uk/centenary/timeline/1910.shtml]</ref>\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{{prose|date=September 2013}}\n* 1907 Formation of Imperial College of Science and Technology incorporating the [[Royal School of Mines]], the [[Royal College of Science]] and [[City and Guilds College]]\n* 1907 Imperial College Union formed as a federation of the 3 College Unions\n* 1911 The Union building in South Kensington is constructed\n* 1922 Founder member of NUS (leaves for the first time in 1923)\n* 1949 [[Felix (newspaper)]] is founded\n* 1969 First directly elected sabbatical President <ref>See [[Felix (newspaper)|Felix]] issues of {{cite web|url=http://felixonline.co.uk/archive/IC_1969/1969_0274_A.pdf|title = 6 March 1969}}and {{cite web|url=http://felixonline.co.uk/archive/IC_1969/1969_0275_A.pdf|title = 20 March 1969}}</ref>\n* 1984 The Union starts catering operation\n* 1985 The Union Starts running own bars\n* 1987 First professional welfare advisor at the Union\n* 1988 Imperial College School of Medicine is established at St. Mary\u2019s\n* 1996 Union Council is made the supreme governing body\n* 1997 Union stops running bookshop on campus.\n* 1997 First medical student to be elected President (Andrew Heeps)<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Heeps|url=https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/trustee-profiles/andy-heeps|publisher=imperialcollegeunion.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n* 1998 First Deputy President (Education & Welfare) Sabbatical\n* 1998 Imperial College School of Medicine merges with Charing Cross and Royal Postgraduate Medical schools\n* 2000 Merger with Wye College and Kennedy Institute\n* 2001 Sir Richard Sykes appointed Rector of Imperial College\n* 2003 College adopts Faculty structure in place of constituent Colleges.\n* 2004 College rebrands as \"Imperial College, London\"\n* 2005 Union Building Redevelopment - Project starts\n* 2005 First Deputy President(Graduate Students) at the Union.\n* 2006 Union Building Redevelopment - Construction work starts\n* 2007 Imperial College Centenary\n* 2007 The Union rejoins the NUS (again)\n* 2007 Imperial College leaves the University of London\n* 2008 The Union leaves the NUS\n* 2009 First Deputy President (Education) and Deputy President (Welfare)\n\n=== Relationship with the NUS ===\nImperial College Union is most noted for the history of its relationship with the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS){{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. Despite being involved in the founding of the NUS in 1922, Imperial College Union withdrew its membership of the NUS a year later{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Since then, Imperial College Union has spent long periods outside the NUS, interspersed with brief periods of membership. A referendum for NUS affiliation held in 2002 was overwhelmingly rejected by members of the Imperial College Union.\n\nIn November 2006, after a petition proposed a debate to affiliate with NUS at [[Orientation week|Freshers' Fair]] 2006 collected 617 valid signatures, from just above the 5% minimum of Imperial College Union members necessary to call a referendum [http://live.cgcu.net/news/1290], a referendum was held between Tuesday 14th and Thursday 16 November 2006. The result of this referendum, which had a record turnout of over 30%, was a yes to NUS affiliation by 53.26% for to 46.74% against.\n\nAfter the failure of governance reform measures supported by Imperial College Union at the NUS conference in 2008, the union council voted in favour of holding a referendum on disaffiliation from the NUS.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://live.cgcu.net/news/1769 |title=Live! - Council Calls NUS Referendum<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=31 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608213148/http://live.cgcu.net/news/1769 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The resulting referendum showed that the Members of Imperial College Union decided that their Union should no longer affiliate to the National Union of Students.\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe Union is controlled by a variety of democratically elected representatives who sit on Union committees, control Union resources and represent the views of students to the College and external bodies. The Union is led by officers who act as representatives to the 14,900 Union members. The most senior officers are the five [[sabbatical]] officers who work full-time for the Union on a variety of areas ranging from commercial services to campaigns and representation. These officers are supported by 35 full-time and up to 250 part-time staff, and the 2,600 elected officers of the Union's 320+ clubs and societies.\n\nIn 2013, the Union successfully registered as a charity.\n\n===Constituent Union Structure===\nThere are six [[Faculty (university)|constituent]] unions which run as constituent parts of the Union. These are largely historical in origin and retain many traditions, such as their names when most of the actual faculties now have different names. Some represent the students in their respective faculties: the [[City and Guilds College Union]] (for engineers), the [[Royal College of Science Union]] (for scientists) and the [[Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union]] (for medical students). They are all run by part-time officers elected from the student body, with the exception of the Medical Union President, who is an elected full-time sabbatical officer with a one-year tenure.\n\nIn 2002 the [[Royal School of Mines#RSM Student.27s Union|Royal School of Mines Union]] was absorbed into the [[City and Guilds College Union]] and became a clubs & societies committee. However, in 2012 after running autonomously from City and Guilds Union for many years, The Royal School of Mines regained its constituent union status, solely looking after the social aspects of its students.\n\nIn the same governance review of 2012, Silwood Park Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Association (representing all postgraduate students) also became a constituent union. The Silwood Park Union operates largely independently from the overall Union but has no part or full-time sabbatical leadership.\n\n== Clubs, volunteering projects and societies ==\nImperial College Union has a large number of student-led clubs, volunteering projects and societies (known as CSPs), with over 400 in total. Funding for CSPs at Imperial College Union is significant, taking up a sizeable portion of the Union's annual subvention provided by [[Imperial College London]], though many clubs supplement this with sponsorship from outside of the Union.\n\nCSPs at Imperial College Union are administered by the [https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committees/18-19/Clubs%2C_Societies_%26_Projects_Board Clubs, Societies' and Project Board], who deal with the majority of procedural issues and who are responsible for representing the clubs within their care to Imperial College Union. Clubs are then grouped and fall under smaller organisational boards (e.g. the Athletics Clubs Committee handles the sports clubs).\n\nExamples of notable student groups are [[InterVol|Project Nepal]] which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development in rural Nepal<ref>[http://felixonline.co.uk/archive/IC_2011/2011_1504_A.pdf Felix Online Archive, November 30 2011] Article on new Project Nepal group at Imperial College and partnership with InterVol. Retrieved 16 January 2012.</ref> and [[El Salvador Project|the El Salvador Project]], a construction based project in Central America.<ref>[http://www.elsalvadorproject.org.uk/2012/sponsors.html El Salvador Project Sponsors Page] El Salvador Project lists Imperial College Union as an official sponsor. Retrieved 16 January 2012.</ref> Other societies include sports-related societies, such as [[Imperial College Boat Club]] and [[Imperial College Gliding Club]]; music societies such as [https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/a-cappella Imperial College A Capella], under which [[The Techtonics]] won the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] in 2016; social societies such as the Imperial College Debating Society. Each department also has its own departmental society.\n\nCSPs are supported by a number of features, including 15 minibuses which are available for clubs to hire. Imperial College also owns a mountain hut in Snowdonia, Wales, which it lets clubs use free of charge.\n\n==Facilities==\n===Bars===\n[[File:Beit_Quad.jpg|thumb|The Union Building forms the northern side of [[Beit Quadrangle|Beit Quad]]. The Union Bar, 568, and Metric are on the ground floor]]\nThe main Union bars are located on the north side of the [[Beit Quadrangle]]. There are three:\n*FiveSixEight is a bar serving food, with large screens often showing sports events or popular music channels.\n*The Union Bar is a small wood-panelled bar, and has existed in its current form since 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/beit-venues/spaces/bars/the-union-bar|title=Beit Venues - The Union Bar|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The bar has a large selection of [[real ale]] and claims to boast the largest collection of pewter [[tankards]] in Europe, with many dating back to the early 20th century. Each tankard represents an officer of one of the clubs and only the current or former club officers are allowed to use their club's tankards.\n*Metric is a nightclub which opened in November 2010. During term time, Metric often plays host to DJs or to live bands performing to the backdrop of an electronic lighting wall. During the summer Metric hosts some of the Proms Extra events (part of [[The Proms]]).\n\nFiveSightEight and The Union Bar are both [[Cask Marque]] Accredited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/news/beit-bars-receives-prestigious-cask-marque-award|title=Beit Bars Receives Prestigious Cask Marque award|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe Union also runs the Reynolds Bar situated in [[Charing Cross Hospital]], largely frequented by the students of [[Imperial College School of Medicine]].  The bar was originally run by CXWSU for the [[Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School]].\n\nThe [[Silwood Park]] campus bar is operated by an external company, although students have pushed for a Union-run bar in recent years. The bar boasts [[Guinness]] and [[Stella Artois]] Cidre on tap and also has a small selection of bottled ales and ciders. Three flavors of [[crisps]] are available to feed hungry patrons. The bar television almost exclusively shows ''[[Big Bang Theory]]'', and there is a small stereo in the main room which students can hook up to their own musical collections if desired.\n\n===Theatre===\nImperial College Union has a theatre located in the [[Union Concert Hall (UCH)]] which is found on the second floor of the Main Union Building, Beit Quad. The majority of performances are put on by the student societies of Imperial College, ranging from serious drama through to Gilbert & Sullivan Marathons. The space is shared with the [[Imperial College Dramatic Society]] and Imperial Cinema and other student societies as a multipurpose space. The theatre has a fly tower with a selection of lighting and fly bars, the venue has lectriflex, DMX and sound & comms multicore installed throughout.\n\nIn the Summer of 2014 the Union Concert Hall underwent an extensive redevelopment after a grant was awarded to do so. In early 2015, the Dramatic Society installed a considerable amount of brand new cabling which will make the venue even more useful to anyone who wishes to use it.\n\n===Cinema===\nImperial College Union has a student run Cinema located in the Union Concert Hall, in [[Beit Hall]]. The Cinema is considered a club under the Arts & Entertainments Board, however provides a service to members and non-members.\n\nThe cinema is a professionally equipped cinema with a 33&nbsp;ft screen, Dolby Digital surround sound system, Kinoton (35mm) and Barco (Digital) projectors and seats up to 200. Pre-show advertisements are provided by [[Pearl & Dean]].\n\n===Redevelopment of the Union Building===\nAs of August 2006 \u00a32.2 million had been raised out of the total \u00a36 million required for the redevelopment of the Union wing of [[Beit Hall]]. All three phases of the building project were completed by 2011, including the full bar and nightclub refurbishment and moving the Union Gym to level 3 of the building.\n\n==Former ICU Presidents and Sabbatical Officers==\n\nNotable former sabbaticals include:\n* [[Piers Corbyn]], President 1969-70.\n* [[Trevor Phillips]], President 1975-77.\n* [[Christopher Fox, Baron Fox]], President 1980.\n* [[Pallab Ghosh]], Felix Editor 1983-84.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.imperialcollegeunion.org Imperial College Union Website]\n\n{{Aldwych Group}}\n{{Imperial College London}}\n\n[[Category:Imperial College London|Union]]\n[[Category:Students' unions in London]]\n", "name_user": "Shadowssettle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:+img from gore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_Union"}
