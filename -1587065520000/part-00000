A right-handed [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] and left-arm [[Leg break|leg-break]] and [[googly]] [[Bowling (cricket)|bowler]], he was known for his attacking style of play. He  captained  both his county and his country; after the [[Second World War]], he served several terms as a [[Test cricket|Test]] selector.\n\nBorn into a cricketing family, Robins attended [[Highgate School]], where he earned a reputation as one of the outstanding schoolboy cricketers of his generation. He made his debut in first-class cricket, for Middlesex, in 1925. At Cambridge he won cricket [[Blue (university sport)|\"blues\"]] in each of his three years, 1926 to 1928. He played his first Test match, against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], in 1929, and thereafter played intermittently for England in each of the seasons up to 1937 \u2013 he played all his cricket as an [[amateur]], which constrained his availability for both county and country. He toured Australia as vice-captain to [[Gubby Allen|G.O. Allen]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1936\u201337|1936\u201337]], and assumed the captaincy of the international side for three matches in 1937. He captained Middlesex from 1935 to 1938, again after the war in 1946 and 1947, and for a final season in 1950. In 1947 he led Middlesex to the [[County Championship]].\n\nRobins was a member of the Test selectors' panel in 1946\u201348, in 1954, and finally in 1962\u201364 when he acted as chairman. He was controversially involved in an unsuccessful attempt, in 1954, to replace the current England captain, [[Len Hutton]], with the young and inexperienced [[David Sheppard]]. He was a strong advocate of \"brighter cricket\", to an extent that sometimes failed to recognise the realities of international cricket in the postwar era, and put him at odds with the players of a later generation. This problem was evident when Robins served as manager of the [[English cricket team in the West Indies in 1959\u201360|touring team to the West Indies in 1959\u201360]], when his forthright, autocratic approach adversely affected his relationship with the team's captain and vice-captain, [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]]  and [[Colin Cowdrey]].\n\nWhatever his difficulties in coming to terms with the cricket of a later era, Robins was widely recognised as one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time, a fact that was acknowledged in the tributes paid after his death, in 1968, by his former playing colleagues. His son, [[Charles Robins]], played for Middlesex from 1953 to 1960, as a leg-spin and googly bowler in the manner of his father.\n\n==Early life==\nRobins was born in [[Stafford]] on 3 June 1906. His father was Vivian Harry Robins (1880\u20131963), who played [[Minor Counties Cricket Championship|Minor Counties]] cricket for [[Staffordshire County Cricket Club|Staffordshire]] before the [[First World War]] as a [[leg-break]] bowler and right-handed batsman \u2013 characteristics which his son would also develop.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}}{{sfn|Vivian Robins}} In 1917 the family moved to London, where Walter Robins attended [[Highgate School]].{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} He was coached at cricket first by his father, to whom he would later attribute much of his eventual success, and, at Highgate, by the former England player [[Albert Knight]]. He also played club cricket for [[East Molesey Cricket Club|East Molesey]].{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}\n\nAt Highgate, Robins was four years in the cricket first XI, 1922 to 1925, being captain in his final year in which he scored 816 runs for a [[Batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of 62.76, and took 60 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 15.18. These figures included a score of 206 against [[Aldenham School]];{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} his all-round performances made him, according to ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'', \"one of the great schoolboy players of the year\".{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}}  In the summer of 1925, before entering [[Cambridge University]], Robins made his debut in [[first-class cricket]], when he appeared for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] in the [[County Championship]].{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} The match was on 19 August, against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. He was out for 0 in his only innings, and did not bowl.{{sfn|Worcestershire v. Middlesex 19\u201320 August 1925}}\n\n==Playing career==\n===Cambridge University===\n[[File:Cambridge Queens' Gatehouse.JPG|thumb|left|Queens' College, Cambridge]]\nRobins began at [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College, Cambridge University]] in October 1925,{{sfn|Queens' College, Cambridge}} and in the following summer gained his cricket [[Blue (university sport)|\"blue\"]]  as a [[freshman]]. At this stage he was seen purely as a batsman; in the 1926 [[The University Match (cricket)|University match]] against [[Oxford University|Oxford]] he made scores of 37 and 21 not out and did not bowl. In the following year against Oxford his scores were 55 and 41, but this effort was passed in 1928, when he scored 53 and 101 not out, and also made an impact as a bowler, with 8 wickets in the match.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} His development as a bowler may have been assisted by a spell he underwent, in 1926, at the [[Aubrey Faulkner]] cricket school.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=103}} His  performance in the 1928 University match earned him a place  in the Gentlemen's team, in the historic [[Gentlemen v. Players]] fixture at [[Lord's]] in June 1928, but here he was largely unsuccessful, taking no wickets and making little impact as a batsman.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}}{{sfn|Gentlemen v. Players, Lord's, 1929}}\n\nIn addition to his cricket prowess, Robins was a competent [[Association football]]er, who played for Cambridge in each of his years at the university, being captain of the side in 1927. A [[Association football positions#Winger|right-winger]], he also played football for the [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]], a prominent amateur team, and later represented the professional side, [[Nottingham Forest]], in two [[English Football League|Football League]] matches, each on Christmas Day, 1929 and 1930.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}{{sfn|Steven Lynch, 2012}}\n\n===Middlesex===\n[[File:Lord's Pavilion.jpg|thumb|The pavilion at Lord's home of Middlesex County Cricket Club (2005 photograph)]]\nRobins's career with Middlesex extended from 1925 to 1951. After leaving Cambridge, he played  his first full season for the county in 1929, scoring 1,134 runs and taking 162 wickets, thus performing the [[Double (cricket)|\"cricketer's double\"]] \u2013 the only time in his career that he achieved this feat although, as ''Wisden'' records, he came near to repeating it on several occasions. Robins's positive batting, with the emphasis on attack, combined with his inventive bowling, made him a popular favourite with crowds.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} His highest score for the county was 140,{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} against Cambridge University in 1930,{{sfn|Midddlesex v. Cambridge University, 17\u201320 May 1930}} and his best bowling return was 8 wickets for 69,{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] in 1929.{{sfn|Middlesex v. Gloucestershire, 15\u201317 May 1929}}   He twice performed [[Hat-trick#Cricket|hat-tricks]]: first against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]  in 1929, and again against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in 1937. He was also recognised as a brilliant [[Fielding (cricket)|fieldsman]], often in  the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|covers]]  but equally, in the [[Fielding (cricket)#Other positions|deep field]].{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}\n\nRobins was one of ''Wisden''{{'}}s five \"Cricketers of the Year\" in 1930.{{sfn|Wilde|2013|pp=121\u2013122}} In its citation, ''Wisden'' described him as \"a remarkable young cricketer of whom the best has quite possibly not yet been seen\".{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} In 1935  he assumed the captaincy of the county and, according to his ''Wisden'' obituarist, \"transformed a hitherto drab Middlesex side\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} The cricket historian [[Alan Gibson]] describes how he \"galvanised\" the team.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=138}} For the first time since the early 1920s, Middlesex became serious contenders for the [[County Championship]], finishing third in 1935,{{sfn|1935 County Championship}} and as runners-up in each of the next three seasons,{{sfn|1936 County Championship}}{{sfn|1937 County Championship}}{{sfn|1938 County Championship}} with a particularly close finish behind [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in 1937.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=139\u201340}} Robins relinquished the captaincy at the end of the  1938 season, but resumed it in 1946 and 1947, after the [[Second World War]],{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} and in 1947 finally led Middlesex to the championship title.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}} He took charge of the county again in 1950,{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} after which, following a single appearance in 1951,{{sfn|Championship matches, Walter Robins}} he left the first-class county game. This was not quite the end of his Middlesex cricket; in 1952 and 1953 he played fairly regularly for the Second XI in  Minor Counties matches.{{sfn|Minor Counties matches, Walter Robins}}\n\n===England===\nAfter playing in the Test Trial match in June 1929,{{sfn|England v. Rest of England 8\u201311 June 1929}} Robins was selected  for the second [[Test cricket|Test]] against the visiting [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]], beginning at Lord's on 29 June. He did nothing of note in the match, and was not chosen again during the series.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} In the following season, he was included in the side to face the [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] in the first Test of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 series]], at [[Trent Bridge|Nottingham]] on 13 June. During the Australians' second innings, as they chased 429 runs to win the match, Robins took the key wicket of [[Don Bradman]], helping to ensure an England victory.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=139}} In the second Test, at Lord's, Australia scored  729 for 6 declared (Bradman 254), the record score for a Test at Lords;{{sfn|Lillywhite 2009}} Robins's bowling figures were 1 for 172 runs off 42 [[Over (cricket)|overs]]. Robins batted as England struggled to save the match \u2013 they eventually lost it by 7 wickets \u2013 and was criticised for his impetuous running between the wickets, after he almost [[run out|ran out]] [[Percy Chapman]], his captain. He was dropped for the remainder of the five-match series, although some critics thought it was a mistake to drop one whom they considered \"the best of our young all-rounders\".{{sfn|Gibson |1989|p=139}}\n[[File:Gubby Allen Cigarette Card.jpg|thumb|upright|left|G.O. Allen, Robins's captain in Australia, 1936\u201337]]\nHowever, Robins remained in the selectors' minds, and was chosen for at least one Test in each of the subsequent summers except 1934, until 1937.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=138}} His best Test bowling performance was 6 for 32 against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1933;  two years later he scored his only Test century, 108 against South Africa.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} He was selected for the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932\u201333|1932\u201333 Australian tour]], under [[Douglas Jardine]], but had to decline because of his business commitments.{{sfn|Bodyline timeline}} In 1936\u201337, however, he was able to go to Australia, as vice-captain to [[Gubby Allen|G.O. Allen]]. It was not a happy tour for Robins. Early on he broke a finger, which affected both his ability to spin the ball and his batting grip; as a result, he had little success with bat or ball, although ''Wisden'' records that he \"fielded magnificently\".{{sfn|Wisden 1938}} England won the first two matches of the five-match Test series; in the third Test, at a crucial point in the Australians' second innings, Robins dropped Bradman. He apologised to his captain; Allen is said to have replied: \"Don't give it a thought, Walter. You've probably cost us the Ashes\". Bradman went on to score 270, Australia won the match and the next two, to take the series.{{sfn|The Observer 2 September 2007}}{{refn |Allen's words are sometimes recorded slightly differently; for example, Swann (2018) has him saying \"Oh, don't give it another thought, old boy. You've just cost us the Ashes, that's all.{{sfn|Swann|2018|p=95}} Swann tells the same story, with almost the same wording, against [[Graham Thorpe]] when Thorpe dropped [[Matthew Elliott (cricketer)|Matthew Elliott]] in the fourth Test against Australia in 1997.{{sfn|Swann|2018|p=192}} |group= n}} \n \nIn 1937, Allen was unable to play much, so the captaincy for the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1937|three-match series]] against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] devolved on Robins.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=136, 164}} England won the series 1\u20130, with two Tests drawn.{{sfn|Frindall|2010|pp=262\u2013264}} Robins considered his appointment as a stop-gap, until Allen's return;{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=122}} in the event, the captaincy passed to [[Walter Hammond]], who in November 1937 changed his status from professional to [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]], in order to fulfil what was then an inviolable condition for appointment to the England captaincy.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=164\u2013165}} The 1937 season thus ended both Robins's captaincy and, as it turned out, his Test career, although during the following ten years his name was from time to time mentioned in connection with the captaincy.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=136}} In 1948, when the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australians were again in England]], Robins was included in the Test Trial which preceded the series. He was unsuccessful in his only innings, and did not bowl;{{sfn|Rest of England v. England 2\u20134 June 1948}} the captaincy remained with [[Norman Yardley]]. Towards the end of the series, when England were 3\u20130 down, there was talk of replacing Yardley with Robins in the final Test, but the idea came to nothing.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=139, 175}}\n\nAltogether, Robins played in 19 Tests, scoring 612 runs (1 [[Century (cricket)|century]], 4 fifties) for a batting average of 26.60, and taking 64 wickets for a bowling average of 27.46. He held 12 catches.{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}}\n\n===Other teams===\nIn March 1930 Robins toured Argentina with [[Julien Cahn|Sir Julien Cahn's XI]], playing in three representative matches.{{sfn|Cahn's XI v. Argentina, 18\u201319 March 1930}}{{sfn|Cahn's XI v. Argentina, 22\u201324 March 1930}}{{sfn|Cahn's XI v. Argentina, 29\u201331 March 1930}} He toured again with Cahn's team, to Canada, Bermuda and the United States in 1933.{{sfn|Dhole 2017}} After the Second World War, in 1951, he led an [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] team which toured Canada.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}{{sfn|Cooper|1999|pp=58, 60}} Following his retirement from county cricket he played occasional first-class matches during the 1950s, for the [[Free Foresters]], the MCC, and other teams.{{sfn|Middlesex CCC: Walter Robins}} His final first-class game was for the MCC against [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]], in Dublin in  1958, when he was 52 years old.{{sfn|First class oldest players, 2019}}\n\nIn all first-class cricket Robins scored 13,844 runs for a batting average of 26.39, including 11 centuries with a highest score of 140. As a bowler he took 969 wickets, average 23.30, taking 10 wickets in a match on four occasions. He also held 217 catches.{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}}\n\n==Test selector==\nAfter the Second World War, Robins served on three separate occasions as a member of the [[Selector (cricket)|England Test selectors' panel]]: 1946\u201348, under the chairmanship first of [[Stanley Jackson|Sir Stanley Jackson]] and then [[Jack Holmes (cricketer)|A.J. Holmes]]; 1954, when [[Harry Altham]] was chairman; and 1962\u201364, when Robins himself chaired the panel.{{sfn|England's Test selection panels}}\n[[File:Len Hutton 1946-07-12.jpg|thumb|upright|Len Hutton, dropped from the Test side in 1948]]\nAs a selector in 1948, Robins was involved in two controversial decisions: the dropping of [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] for the third Test of the 1948 series against Australia, and the omission of [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] from the fourth Test of the same series.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=278}} Hutton was dropped on the grounds that he had displayed deficiencies against the pace of the Australian bowlers [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]]. His replacement was the Gloucestershire batsman [[George Emmett]], who scored 10 and 0 in the match; Hutton was speedily reinstated.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=189}} Wright's omission from the [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Leeds]] Test, which deprived England of the services of their leading [[Spin bowling|spinner]] probably, in the view of the cricket historian [[Simon Wilde]], cost them victory in the match.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=278}}\n\nIn 1954, Robins promoted the idea that for the forthcoming [[MCC tour of Australia in 1954\u201355|1954\u201355 tour of Australia]], Hutton, who had been appointed two years earlier as England's first professional captain in the 20th century, should be replaced by [[David Sheppard]], his deputy in two Tests against the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 1954|1954 Pakistan side]] when Hutton was unwell. The ostensible reason given was to enable Hutton to concentrate on his batting, though some saw the move as reflecting the continuing antagonism of the old cricketing \"establishment\" to the advent of a professional captain. The matter was resolved in Hutton's favour, and he duly led the side to victory in Australia.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nAs chairman from 1962, Robins let it be known that he favoured positive play: \"Play aggressively at all times; otherwise you will not be chosen for England\".{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}} ''Wisden'' records that, in terms of England's results during this period, this ultimatum had  limited effect, though \"at least it relieved Test cricket of some of the stagnation which threatened its popularity at the time\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} In 1962, Robins again raised the prospect of Sheppard's captaincy, in relation to the 1962\u201363 Australian tour. At this stage Sheppard, by now an ordained clergyman in charge of the [[Dockland Settlements|Mayflower Centre]] in London's Docklands, had not played Test cricket for five years. He was, however, willing to go if chosen and, in a demonstration of his current form,  scored a century in the Gentlemen v. Players fixture. Despite this, and Robins's advocacy, the captaincy went to [[Ted Dexter]].{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=202}}{{refn |Wilde argues that one factor in Sheppard's non-appointment was his declared opposition to the racial [[apartheid]] policies in South Africa which, some felt, might lead to embarrassment in Australia if, for example, he was questioned about the then-current [[White Australia policy|\"White Australia\"]] policy.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|pp=240\u2013241}}|group= n}}\n\nRobins's selectorial approach did not impress all of his fellow-selectors. [[Alec Bedser]],  in an interview with [[Frank Keating]] many years later, remembered: \"We would meet at his flat on a Sunday morning. He never really watched any cricket. Just went by what he read in the papers or heard from his cronies. He would turn up to the first day of a Test, but on the second day, after lunch, he'd sometimes clear off and go to the pictures\".{{sfn|Engel|2014|p=30}}\n\n==Tour manager==\nWhen England toured the West Indies early in 1960, under the captaincy of [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], Robins was appointed as tour manager. In terms of results the tour was successful \u2013 England won the five-match Test series 1\u20130 \u2013 but Robins was less felicitous in his managerial role. He failed to form a satisfactory relationship with May, or with the other players. According to [[Colin Cowdrey]], May's vice-captain, almost before the ship carrying the party had left British waters Robins was seeking to impose his ideas of \"military discipline\" on the side, and telling May how the team should be run.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}}  May fell ill during the tour, and Cowdrey assumed the leadership. In the final Test of the series, which was heading for a draw, Robins tried to persuade Cowdrey to \"make a game of it\", but Cowdrey chose to protect England's series lead and play cautiously.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}} Afterwards, to the team's dismay, Robins came to the dressing room and publicly castigated Cowdrey, in front of the players, for his lack of spirit. This was too much for England's leading fast bowler, [[Fred Trueman]] who, according to another player's account, ordered Robins out of the room: \"You ain't no bloody business in 'ere. Get out!\".{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Keith Carmody and Walter Robins 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Robins (right) and Carmody at Lord's, England XI v Dominions, 1943]] \nRobins played all his cricket as an amateur and, not being independently wealthy, had to find employment when he left Cambridge in 1928 without taking a degree. As a result, business commitments often restricted Robins's ability to pursue his cricket career, both at county and international level. Initially he  worked for [[Julien Cahn|Sir Julien Cahn]] in the latter's furniture business. Cahn, an avid cricket enthusiast, employed numerous  cricketers who formed the backbone of his private XI, which played first-class cricket throughout the 1930s. Later, Robins worked in a successful family insurance brokerage, which was probably established with Cahn's help.{{sfn|Chandler 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Robins served in the [[Royal Air Force]], reaching the rank of [[squadron leader]]. He played cricket when he could, and in 1943, in a two-day match at Lord's, captained an England XI against a Dominions XI led by the Australian [[Keith Carmody]]. The Dominions team included the future Australian Test all-rounder [[Keith Miller]], and the West Indies Test bowler [[Learie Constantine]]. In a close game the England XI were victorious by eight runs.{{sfn|England XI v Dominions, 1943}}\n\nVarious members of the Robins family contributed to cricket, for Middlesex and elsewhere. Walter's younger brother, [[William Robins (cricketer)|William Vernon Harry Robins]], a career Army officer, played several first-class matches for the Army during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cricinfo: William Robins}} Walter Robins's son, [[Charles Robins|Robert Victor Charles Robins]], known as Charles Robins and, like his father, a leg-spin and googly bowler, was captain of the [[Eton College|Eton XI]] in 1953, and played for Middlesex between 1953 and 1960.{{sfn|Cricinfo: Charles Robins}}{{sfn|Middlesex CCC: Charles Robins}} Walter's grandson Charles William Veral Robins (born 1965) played for Middlesex 2nd XI in 1983.{{sfn|Middlesex CCC: Charles William Veral Robins}}\n\nAfter his playing days ended, Robins continued to serve Middlesex as a member of its general and cricket committees. He died, aged 62, on 12 December 1968.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}\n\n==Appraisal==\nIn its 1969 obituary tribute, ''Wisden'' acknowledges  Robins as \"one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time\",{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} who maintained an \"aggressively enterprising\" attitude towards the game:  \"Impatient of dull cricket, Robins wasted few scoring opportunities as a batsman, employing his nimble footwork and flexible wrists to the full, especially in cutting and driving\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} There was some early criticism of his effectiveness as a bowler \u2013 he sometimes tried  to bowl too fast, and was erratic in maintaining length{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} \u2013 but Wilde's analysis of English Test bowlers of leg-breaks and [[googly|googlies]] shows Robins, at international level, to have been one of the most effective of this kind in terms both of wickets taken and of cost per wicket.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nThere were divided opinions on Robins's effectiveness as a selector. [[Doug Insole]], who served with him between 1962 and 1964, considered that his judgement of a player was \"excellent\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} Others were less sure; Wilde records that during Robins's first stint as a selector, 1946\u201348, the Australians were dismissive of his judgement, an opinion apparently shared by the former England captain [[Bob Wyatt]], who \"would have liked more intelligent people on the committee\".{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=278}} Gibson is critical of Robins's efforts to replace Hutton as captain in 1954,{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=187}} an action which Wilde describes as \"disloyal and unhelpful\".{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}} It seems that Robins was not particularly popular with the players of a later generation, and that he made little effort to understand them.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}}{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=317}} According to Wilde, Robins failed to recognise the extent to which, in the postwar era, international cricket had changed from his own heyday in the 1930s. It had, says Wilde, become much more tough and attritional, hence Robins's repeated calls for more attacking, brighter cricket were often inappropriate and doomed to failure.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}}\n\nNevertheless, in the view  of [[Billy Griffith]], the cricket administrator and long-serving secretary of the MCC, Robins's \"tremendous enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the game and its history made him the complete cricketer\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} Robins's Middlesex colleague [[Ian Peebles]], who succeeded him as county captain in 1939, described him as \"the most enthusiastic and joyous cricketer I played with\".{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n|}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n====Books and journals====\n*{{cite journal|last= Cooper|first= David|title= Canadians Declare \"It Isn't Cricket\": A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860-1960|journal= Journal of Sport History|publisher= University of Illinois Press|volume= 26|issue= 1|pages= 51\u201381|year= 1999|ref= harv|jstor= 43611718}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Matthew Engel|last= Engel|first= Matthew (ed.)|title= The Highlights: The Best of Frank Keating|year= 2014|publisher= Faber & Faber|location= London|isbn= 978-1-7833-5019-3|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Bill Frindall|last= Frindall|first= Bill|title= The Wisden Book of Test Cricket|url= https://books.google.com/?id=bN3lYkbUZAwC&dq=England+v+New+Zealand+1937|publisher= John Wisden & Co|location= London|year= 2010|isbn= 978-1-4081-2756-8|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Alan Gibson|last= Gibson|first= Alan|title= The Cricket Captains of England|publisher= The Pavilion Library|year= 1989|location= London|isbn=978-1-851-453955|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Graeme Swann|last= Swann|first= Graeme|title= The Ashes (It's All About the Urn)|publisher= Hodder and Stoughton|year= 2018|location= London|isbn= 978-1-4736-70853|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Simon Wilde|last= Wilde|first= Simon|title= Wisden Cricketers of the Year: A Celebration of Cricket's Greatest Players|publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing|location= London|year= 2013|isbn= 978-1-4081-40840|ref= harv|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/wisdencricketers0000wild}}\n*{{cite book|last= Wilde|first= Simon|title= England: the Biography|publisher= Simon & Schuster|location= London|year= 2019|isbn= 978-1-4711-5485-0|ref= harv}}\n\n====Online====\n*{{cite news|title= 1935 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL//ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1935.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1935 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite news|title= 1936 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1936.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1936 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite news|title= 1937 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1937.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1937 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite news|title= 1938 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1938.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1938 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite web|last= Chandler|first= Martin|title= Book review: ''Walter Robins: Achievements, Affections and Affronts''.

A right-handed [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] and left-arm [[Leg break|leg-break]] and [[googly]] [[Bowling (cricket)| bowler]], he was known for his attacking style of play. He  captained  both his county and his country; after the [[Second World War]], he served several terms as a [[Test cricket|Test]] selector.  \n\nBorn into a cricketing family, Robins attended [[Highgate School]], where he earned a reputation as one of the outstanding schoolboy cricketers of his generation. He made his debut in first-class cricket, for Middlesex, in 1925. At Cambridge he won cricket [[Blue (university sport)|\"blues\"]] in each of his three years, 1926 to 1928. He played his first Test match, against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], in 1929, and thereafter played intermittently for England in each of the seasons up to 1937 \u2013 he played all his cricket as an [[amateur]], which constrained his availability for both county and country. He toured Australia as vice-captain to [[Gubby Allen|G.O. Allen]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1936\u201337|1936\u201337]], and assumed the captaincy of the international side for three matches in 1937. He captained Middlesex from 1935 to 1938, again after the war in 1946 and 1947, and for a final season in 1950. In 1947 he led Middlesex to the [[County Championship]]. \n\nRobins was a member of the Test selectors' panel in 1946\u201348, in 1954, and finally in 1962\u201364 when he acted as chairman. He was controversially involved in an unsuccessful attempt, in 1954, to replace the current England captain, [[Len Hutton]], with the young and inexperienced [[David Sheppard]]. He was a strong advocate of \"brighter cricket\", to an extent that sometimes failed to recognise the realities of international cricket in the postwar era, and put him at odds with the players of a later generation. This problem was evident when Robins served as manager of the [[English cricket team in the West Indies in 1959\u201360|touring team to the West Indies in 1959\u201360]], when his forthright, autocratic approach adversely affected his relationship with the team's captain and vice-captain, [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]]  and [[Colin Cowdrey]].\n\nWhatever his difficulties in coming to terms with the cricket of a later era, Robins was widely recognised as one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time, a fact that was acknowledged in the tributes paid after his death, in 1968, by his former playing colleagues. His son, [[Charles Robins]], played for Middlesex from 1953 to 1960, as a leg-spin and googly bowler in the manner of his father.\n\n==Early life==\nRobins was born in [[Stafford]] on 3 June 1906. His father was Vivian Harry Robins (1880\u20131963), who played [[Minor Counties Cricket Championship|Minor Counties]] cricket for [[Staffordshire County Cricket Club|Staffordshire]] before the [[First World War]] as a [[leg-break]] bowler and right-handed batsman \u2013 characteristics which his son would also develop.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}}{{sfn|Vivian Robins}} In 1917 the family moved to London, where Walter Robins attended [[Highgate School]].{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} He was coached at cricket first by his father, to whom he would later attribute much of his eventual success, and, at Highgate, by the former England player [[Albert Knight]]. He also played club cricket for [[East Molesey Cricket Club|East Molesey]].{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}\n\nAt Highgate, Robins was four years in the cricket first XI, 1922 to 1925, being captain in his final year in which he scored 816 runs for a [[Batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of 62.76, and took 60 wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 15.18. These figures included a score of 206 against [[Aldenham School]];{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} his all-round performances made him, according to ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'', \"one of the great schoolboy players of the year\".{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}}  In the summer of 1925, before entering [[Cambridge University]], Robins made his debut in [[first-class cricket]], when he appeared for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] in the [[County Championship]].{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} The match was on 19 August, against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]. He was out for 0 in his only innings, and did not bowl.{{sfn|Worcestershire v.

At this stage he was seen purely as a batsman; in the 1926 [[The University Match (cricket)|University match]] against [[Oxford University|Oxford]] he made scores of 37 and 21 not out and did not bowl. In the following year against Oxford his scores were 55 and 41, but this effort was passed in 1928, when he scored 53 and 101 not out, and also made an impact as a bowler, with 8 wickets in the match.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} His development as a bowler may have been assisted by a spell he underwent, in 1926, at the [[Aubrey Faulkner]] cricket school.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=103}} His  performance in the 1928 University match earned him a place  in the Gentlemen's team, in the historic [[Gentlemen v.

A [[Association football positions#Winger|right-winger]], he also played football for the [[Corinthian F.C.|Corinthians]], a prominent amateur team, and later represented the professional side, [[Nottingham Forest]], in two [[English Football League|Football League]] matches, each on Christmas Day, 1929 and 1930.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}{{sfn|Steven Lynch, 2012}}\n\n===Middlesex===\n[[File:Lord's Pavilion.jpg|thumb|The pavilion at Lord's home of Middlesex County Cricket Club (2005 photograph)]]\nRobins's career with Middlesex extended from 1925 to 1951.  After leaving Cambridge, he played  his first full season for the county in 1929, scoring 1,134 runs and taking 162 wickets, thus performing the [[Double (cricket)|\"cricketer's double\"]] \u2013 the only time in his career that he achieved this feat although, as ''Wisden'' records, he came near to repeating it on several occasions. Robins's positive batting, with the emphasis on attack, combined with his inventive bowling, made him a popular favourite with crowds.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} His highest score for the county was 140,{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} against Cambridge University in 1930,{{sfn|Midddlesex v.

He was also recognised as a brilliant [[Fielding (cricket)|fieldsman]], often in  the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|covers]]  but equally, in the [[Fielding (cricket)#Other positions|deep field]].{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} \n\nRobins was one of ''Wisden''{{'}}s five \"Cricketers of the Year\" in 1930.{{sfn|Wilde|2013|pp=121\u2013122}} In its citation, ''Wisden'' described him as \"a remarkable young cricketer of whom the best has quite possibly not yet been seen\".{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} In 1935  he assumed the captaincy of the county and, according to his ''Wisden'' obituarist, \"transformed a hitherto drab Middlesex side\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} The cricket historian [[Alan Gibson]] describes how he \"galvanised\" the team.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=138}} For the first time since the early 1920s, Middlesex became serious contenders for the [[County Championship]], finishing third in 1935,{{sfn|1935 County Championship}} and as runners-up in each of the next three seasons,{{sfn|1936 County Championship}}{{sfn|1937 County Championship}}{{sfn|1938 County Championship}} with a particularly close finish behind [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in 1937.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=139\u201340}} Robins relinquished the captaincy at the end of the  1938 season, but resumed it in 1946 and 1947, after the [[Second World War]],{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} and in 1947 finally led Middlesex to the championship title.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}} He took charge of the county again in 1950,{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}} after which, following a single appearance in 1951,{{sfn|Championship matches, Walter Robins}} he left the first-class county game. This was not quite the end of his Middlesex cricket; in 1952 and 1953 he played fairly regularly for the Second XI in  Minor Counties matches.{{sfn|Minor Counties matches, Walter Robins}}\n\n===England===\nAfter playing in the Test Trial match in June 1929,{{sfn|England v. Rest of England 8\u201311 June 1929}} Robins was selected  for the second [[Test cricket|Test]] against the visiting [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]], beginning at Lord's on 29 June. He did nothing of note in the match, and was not chosen again during the series.{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} In the following season, he was included in the side to face the [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] in the first Test of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 series]], at [[Trent Bridge|Nottingham]] on 13 June. During the Australians' second innings, as they chased 429 runs to win the match, Robins took the key wicket of [[Don Bradman]], helping to ensure an England victory.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=139}} In the second Test, at Lord's, Australia scored  729 for 6 declared (Bradman 254), the record score for a Test at Lords;{{sfn|Lillywhite 2009}} Robins's bowling figures were 1 for 172 runs off 42 [[Over (cricket)|overs]]. Robins batted as England struggled to save the match \u2013 they eventually lost it by 7 wickets \u2013 and was criticised for his impetuous running between the wickets, after he almost [[run out|ran out]] [[Percy Chapman]], his captain. He was dropped for the remainder of the five-match series, although some critics thought it was a mistake to drop one whom they considered \"the best of our young all-rounders\".{{sfn|Gibson |1989|p=139}}\n[[File:Gubby Allen Cigarette Card.jpg|thumb|upright|left|G.O. Allen, Robins's captain in Australia, 1936\u201337]]\nHowever, Robins remained in the selectors' minds, and was chosen for at least one Test in each of the subsequent summers except 1934, until 1937.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=138}} His best Test bowling performance was 6 for 32 against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1933;  two years later he scored his only Test century, 108 against South Africa.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} He was selected for the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1932\u201333|1932\u201333 Australian tour]], under [[Douglas Jardine]], but had to decline because of his business commitments.{{sfn|Bodyline timeline}} In 1936\u201337, however, he was able to go to Australia, as vice-captain to [[Gubby Allen|G.O. Allen]]. It was not a happy tour for Robins. Early on he broke a finger, which affected both his ability to spin the ball and his batting grip; as a result, he had little success with bat or ball, although ''Wisden'' records that he \"fielded magnificently\".{{sfn|Wisden 1938}} England won the first two matches of the five-match Test series; in the third Test, at a crucial point in the Australians' second innings, Robins dropped Bradman. He apologised to his captain; Allen is said to have replied: \"Don't give it a thought, Walter. You've probably cost us the Ashes\". Bradman went on to score 270, Australia won the match and the next two, to take the series.{{sfn|The Observer 2 September 2007}}{{refn |Allen's words are sometimes recorded slightly differently; for example, Swann (2018) has him saying \"Oh, don't give it another thought, old boy.

He was unsuccessful in his only innings, and did not bowl;{{sfn|Rest of England v. England 2\u20134 June 1948}} the captaincy remained with [[Norman Yardley]]. Towards the end of the series, when England were 3\u20130 down, there was talk of replacing Yardley with Robins in the final Test, but the idea came to nothing.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=139, 175}} \n\nAltogether, Robins played in 19 Tests, scoring 612 runs (1 [[Century (cricket)|century]], 4 fifties) for a batting average of 26.60, and taking 64 wickets for a bowling average of 27.46. He held 12 catches.{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}}\n\n===Other teams===\nIn March 1930 Robins toured Argentina with [[Julien Cahn|Sir Julien Cahn's XI]], playing in three representative matches.{{sfn|Cahn's XI v.

He also held 217 catches.{{sfn|Cricinfo: Walter Robins}}\n\n==Test selector==\nAfter the Second World War, Robins served on three separate occasions as a member of the [[Selector (cricket)|England Test selectors' panel]]: 1946\u201348, under the chairmanship first of [[Stanley Jackson|Sir Stanley Jackson]] and then [[Jack Holmes (cricketer)|A.J. Holmes]]; 1954, when [[Harry Altham]] was chairman; and 1962\u201364, when Robins himself chaired the panel.{{sfn|England's Test selection panels}}\n[[File:Len Hutton 1946-07-12.jpg|thumb|upright|Len Hutton, dropped from the Test side in 1948]]\nAs a selector in 1948, Robins was involved in two controversial decisions: the dropping of [[Len Hutton|Hutton]] for the third Test of the 1948 series against Australia, and the omission of [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] from the fourth Test of the same series.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=278}} Hutton was dropped on the grounds that he had displayed deficiencies against the pace of the Australian bowlers [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]]. His replacement was the Gloucestershire batsman [[George Emmett]], who scored 10 and 0 in the match; Hutton was speedily reinstated.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=189}} Wright's omission from the [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Leeds]] Test, which deprived England of the services of their leading [[Spin bowling|spinner]] probably, in the view of the cricket historian [[Simon Wilde]], cost them victory in the match.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=278}}\n\nIn 1954, Robins promoted the idea that for the forthcoming [[MCC tour of Australia in 1954\u201355|1954\u201355 tour of Australia]], Hutton, who had been appointed two years earlier as England's first professional captain in the 20th century, should be replaced by [[David Sheppard]], his deputy in two Tests against the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 1954|1954 Pakistan side]] when Hutton was unwell.  The ostensible reason given was to enable Hutton to concentrate on his batting, though some saw the move as reflecting the continuing antagonism of the old cricketing \"establishment\" to the advent of a professional captain. The matter was resolved in Hutton's favour, and he duly led the side to victory in Australia.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nAs chairman from 1962, Robins let it be known that he favoured positive play: \"Play aggressively at all times; otherwise you will not be chosen for England\".{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}} ''Wisden'' records that, in terms of England's results during this period, this ultimatum had  limited effect, though \"at least it relieved Test cricket of some of the stagnation which threatened its popularity at the time\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} In 1962, Robins again raised the prospect of Sheppard's captaincy, in relation to the 1962\u201363 Australian tour. At this stage Sheppard, by now an ordained clergyman in charge of the [[Dockland Settlements|Mayflower Centre]] in London's Docklands, had not played Test cricket for five years. He was, however, willing to go if chosen and, in a demonstration of his current form,  scored a century in the Gentlemen v. Players fixture. Despite this, and Robins's advocacy, the captaincy went to [[Ted Dexter]].{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=202}}{{refn |Wilde argues that one factor in Sheppard's non-appointment was his declared opposition to the racial [[apartheid]] policies in South Africa which, some felt, might lead to embarrassment in Australia if, for example, he was questioned about the then-current [[White Australia policy|\"White Australia\"]] policy.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|pp=240\u2013241}}|group= n}} \n\nRobins's selectorial approach did not impress all of his fellow-selectors.  [[Alec Bedser]],  in an interview with [[Frank Keating]] many years later, remembered: \"We would meet at his flat on a Sunday morning. He never really watched any cricket. Just went by what he read in the papers or heard from his cronies. He would turn up to the first day of a Test, but on the second day, after lunch, he'd sometimes clear off and go to the pictures\".{{sfn|Engel|2014|p=30}}\n\n==Tour manager==\nWhen England toured the West Indies early in 1960, under the captaincy of [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], Robins was appointed as tour manager. In terms of results the tour was successful \u2013 England won the five-match Test series 1\u20130 \u2013 but Robins was less felicitous in his managerial role. He failed to form a satisfactory relationship with May, or with the other players. According to [[Colin Cowdrey]], May's vice-captain, almost before the ship carrying the party had left British waters Robins was seeking to impose his ideas of \"military discipline\" on the side, and telling May how the team should be run.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}}  May fell ill during the tour, and Cowdrey assumed the leadership. In the final Test of the series, which was heading for a draw, Robins tried to persuade Cowdrey to \"make a game of it\", but Cowdrey chose to protect England's series lead and play cautiously.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}} Afterwards, to the team's dismay, Robins came to the dressing room and publicly castigated Cowdrey, in front of the players, for his lack of spirit. This was too much for England's leading fast bowler, [[Fred Trueman]] who, according to another player's account, ordered Robins out of the room: \"You ain't no bloody business in 'ere. Get out!\".{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Keith Carmody and Walter Robins 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Robins (right) and Carmody at Lord's, England XI v Dominions, 1943]] \nRobins played all his cricket as an amateur and, not being independently wealthy, had to find employment when he left Cambridge in 1928 without taking a degree. As a result, business commitments often restricted Robins's ability to pursue his cricket career, both at county and international level. Initially he  worked for [[Julien Cahn|Sir Julien Cahn]] in the latter's furniture business. Cahn, an avid cricket enthusiast, employed numerous  cricketers who formed the backbone of his private XI, which played first-class cricket throughout the 1930s. Later, Robins worked in a successful family insurance brokerage, which was probably established with Cahn's help.{{sfn|Chandler 2014}} \n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Robins served in the [[Royal Air Force]], reaching the rank of [[Squadron leader|squadron leader]]. He played cricket when he could, and in 1943, in a two-day match at Lord's, captained an England XI against a Dominions XI led by the Australian [[Keith Carmody]]. The Dominions team included the future Australian Test all-rounder [[Keith Miller]], and the West Indies Test bowler [[Learie Constantine]]. In a close game the England XI were victorious by eight runs.{{sfn|England XI v Dominions, 1943}} \n\nVarious members of the Robins family contributed to cricket, for Middlesex and elsewhere. Walter's younger brother, [[William Robins (cricketer)|William Vernon Harry Robins]], a career Army officer, played several first-class matches for the Army during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cricinfo: William Robins}} Walter Robins's son, [[Charles Robins|Robert Victor Charles Robins]], known as Charles Robins and, like his father, a leg-spin and googly bowler, was captain of the [[Eton College|Eton XI]] in 1953, and played for Middlesex between 1953 and 1960.{{sfn|Cricinfo: Charles Robins}}{{sfn|Middlesex CCC: Charles Robins}} Walter's grandson Charles William Veral Robins (born 1965) played for Middlesex 2nd XI in 1983.{{sfn|Middlesex CCC: Charles William Veral Robins}}.\n\nAfter his playing days ended, Robins continued to serve Middlesex as a member of its general and cricket committees. He died, aged 62, on 12 December 1968.{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}}\n\n==Appraisal==\nIn its 1969 obituary tribute, ''Wisden'' acknowledges  Robins as \"one of the most dynamic cricketers of his time\",{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} who maintained an \"aggressively enterprising\" attitude towards the game:  \"Impatient of dull cricket, Robins wasted few scoring opportunities as a batsman, employing his nimble footwork and flexible wrists to the full, especially in cutting and driving\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} There was some early criticism of his effectiveness as a bowler \u2013 he sometimes tried  to bowl too fast, and was erratic in maintaining length{{sfn|Walter Robins 1930}} \u2013 but Wilde's analysis of English Test bowlers of leg-breaks and [[googly|googlies]] shows Robins, at international level, to have been one of the most effective of this kind in terms both of wickets taken and of cost per wicket.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|pp=105\u2013106}}  \n\nThere were divided opinions on Robins's effectiveness as a selector. [[Doug Insole]], who served with him between 1962 and 1964, considered that his judgement of a player was \"excellent\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} Others were less sure; Wilde records that during Robins's first stint as a selector, 1946\u201348, the Australians were dismissive of his judgement, an opinion apparently shared by the former England captain [[Bob Wyatt]], who \"would have liked more intelligent people on the committee\".{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=278}} Gibson is critical of Robins's efforts to replace Hutton as captain in 1954,{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=187}} an action which Wilde describes as \"disloyal and unhelpful\".{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}} It seems that Robins was not particularly popular with the players of a later generation, and that he made little effort to understand them.{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}}{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=317}} According to Wilde, Robins failed to recognise the extent to which, in the postwar era, international cricket had changed from his own heyday in the 1930s. It had, says Wilde, become much more tough and attritional, hence Robins's repeated calls for more attacking, brighter cricket were often inappropriate and doomed to failure.{{sfn|Wilde|2019|p=320}}\n\nNevertheless, in the view  of [[Billy Griffith]], the cricket administrator and long-serving secretary of the MCC, Robins's \"tremendous enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the game and its history made him the complete cricketer\".{{sfn|Wisden obituary 1969}} Robins's Middlesex colleague [[Ian Peebles]], who succeeded him as county captain in 1939, described him as \"the most enthusiastic and joyous cricketer I played with\".{{sfn|Gibson|1989|p=141}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n|}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n====Books and journals====\n*{{cite journal|last= Cooper|first= David|title= Canadians Declare \"It Isn't Cricket\": A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860-1960|journal= Journal of Sport History|publisher= University of Illinois Press|volume= 26|issue= 1|pages= 51\u201381|year= 1999|ref= harv|jstor= 43611718}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Matthew Engel|last= Engel|first= Matthew (ed.)|title= The Highlights: The Best of Frank Keating|year= 2014|publisher= Faber & Faber|location= London|isbn= 978-1-7833-5019-3|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Bill Frindall|last= Frindall|first= Bill|title= The Wisden Book of Test Cricket|url= https://books.google.com/?id=bN3lYkbUZAwC&dq=England+v+New+Zealand+1937|publisher= John Wisden & Co|location= London|year= 2010|isbn= 978-1-4081-2756-8|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Alan Gibson|last= Gibson|first= Alan|title= The Cricket Captains of England|publisher= The Pavilion Library|year= 1989|location= London|isbn=978-1-851-453955|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Graeme Swann|last= Swann|first= Graeme|title= The Ashes (It's All About the Urn)|publisher= Hodder and Stoughton|year= 2018|location= London|isbn= 978-1-4736-70853|ref= harv}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink= Simon Wilde|last= Wilde|first= Simon|title= Wisden Cricketers of the Year: A Celebration of Cricket's Greatest Players|publisher= Bloomsbury Publishing|location= London|year= 2013|isbn= 978-1-4081-40840|ref= harv|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/wisdencricketers0000wild}}\n*{{cite book|last= Wilde|first= Simon|title= England: the Biography|publisher= Simon & Schuster|location= London|year= 2019|isbn= 978-1-4711-5485-0|ref= harv}}\n\n====Online====\n*{{cite news|title= 1935 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL//ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1935.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1935 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite news|title= 1936 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1936.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1936 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite news|title= 1937 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1937.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1937 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite news|title= 1938 County Cricket Championship|url= http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ENG/CHAMPIONSHIP/TABLES/CC_TABLE_1938.html|work= Cricinfo|accessdate= 17 August 2019|ref= {{sfnRef|1938 County Championship}} }}\n*{{cite web|last= Chandler|first= Martin|title= Book review: ''Walter Robins: Achievements, Affections and Affronts''.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 258, down from 309 in 2000. The city is located in the large [[I\u00f1upiaq language]] speaking region of Alaska, and the local dialect is known as the Ambler dialect (related to the Shugnak dialect). {{as of|1999}}, over 91% of the community speaks and understands the language (Kraus, 1999), with many young children actively learning the language in school. It has important relationships with the \"hub\" city of [[Kotzebue, Alaska]] and has important relationships with [[Maniilaq]] Health Association.\n\n==Geography==\nAmbler is located at {{coord|67.085000|-157.860331|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}},<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> on the north bank of the Kobuk River, near the confluence of the Ambler and the Kobuk Rivers. It lies 45 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It is 138 miles northeast of Kotzebue, 30 miles northwest of Kobuk and 30 miles downriver from Shungnak. Ambler is located in the Kotzebue Recording District.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of {{convert|10.8|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|9.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2}} of it (11.91%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nAmbler is located in the continental climate zone. Temperatures have  ranged from 93F to -74F.  The [[Kobuk River]] is navigable from early June to mid-October. Ambler has a [[subarctic climate]] with long, extremely cold winters and short, warm summers. Temperatures in the winter often drop below -40&nbsp;\u00b0C/\u00b0F, just like most of interior [[Alaska]], but it frequently gets mild spells where the temperatures stay above 10&nbsp;\u00b0F (-12&nbsp;\u00b0C) for several days in a row because of the relative closeness to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It occasionally gets above freezing in winter, even in January, although it is not very common. Places further East like [[Fairbanks]] and [[Fort Yukon]], for comparison, are usually lightly affected by the mild Pacific air. Ambler is also wetter because of this.

{{IPA-ik|ivisa\u02d0p\u02d0a\u02d0t|IPA}}) is a city in [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska]], United States. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 258, down from 309 in 2000. The city is located in the large [[I\u00f1upiaq language]] speaking region of Alaska, and the local dialect is known as the Ambler dialect (related to the Shugnak dialect). {{as of|1999}}, over 91% of the community speaks and understands the language (Kraus, 1999), with many young children actively learning the language in school. It has important relationships with the \"hub\" city of [[Kotzebue, Alaska]] and has important relationships with [[Maniilaq]] Health Association.\n\n==Geography==\nAmbler is located at {{coord|67.085000|-157.860331|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}},<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> on the north bank of the Kobuk River, near the confluence of the Ambler and the Kobuk Rivers. It lies 45 miles north of the Arctic Circle. It is 138 miles northeast of Kotzebue, 30 miles northwest of Kobuk and 30 miles downriver from Shungnak. Ambler is located in the Kotzebue Recording District.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of {{convert|10.8|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|9.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|1.3|sqmi|km2}} of it (11.91%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nAmbler is located in the continental climate zone. Temperatures have  ranged from 93F to -74F.  The [[Kobuk River]] is navigable from early June to mid-October. Ambler has a [[subarctic climate]] with long, extremely cold winters and short, warm summers. Temperatures in the winter often drop below -40&nbsp;\u00b0C/\u00b0F, just like most of interior [[Alaska]], but it frequently gets mild spells where the temperatures stay above 10&nbsp;\u00b0F (-12&nbsp;\u00b0C) for several days in a row because of the relative closeness to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It occasionally gets above freezing in winter, even in January, although it is not very common. Places further East like [[Fairbanks]] and [[Fort Yukon]], for comparison, are usually lightly affected by the mild Pacific air. Ambler is also wetter because of this. Summers are quite variable too, as the weather alternates between warm days and cooler days. The highest temperature of any given year is about 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (26&nbsp;\u00b0C) and occasionally above 86&nbsp;\u00b0F (30&nbsp;\u00b0C), occurring as recently as June 18 and 19, 2013 with a maximum temperature of 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) recorded on both days.\nBelow is a table containing data for the period 1981-1992:\n\n{{Weather box\n|single line = Y\n|location=     Ambler West, Alaska\n\n|Jan record high F = 37\n|Feb record high F = 38\n|Mar record high F = 40\n|Apr record high F = 53\n|May record high F = 85\n|Jun record high F = 93\n|Jul record high F = 92\n|Aug record high F = 85\n|Sep record high F = 75\n|Oct record high F = 46\n|Nov record high F = 39\n|Dec record high F = 35\n|year record high F =\n\n|Jan high F =\u22120.7\n|Feb high F = 0.8\n|Mar high F =14.1\n|Apr high F =25.3\n|May high F =50.7\n|Jun high F =69.4\n|Jul high F =71.1\n|Aug high F =62.0\n|Sep high F =49.2\n|Oct high F =26.8\n|Nov high F = 7.4\n|Dec high F = 6.6\n|year high F=\n\n|Jan mean F =\u22129.3\n|Feb mean F =\u22129.4\n|Mar mean F = 2.1\n|Apr mean F =13.5\n|May mean F =40.2\n|Jun mean F =56.3\n|Jul mean F =59.3\n|Aug mean F =52.1\n|Sep mean F =40.7\n|Oct mean F =19.7\n|Nov mean F = 0.1\n|Dec mean F =\u22121.7\n|year mean F =\n\n|Jan low F =\u221217.9\n|Feb low F =\u221219.6\n|Mar low F =\u221210.0\n|Apr low F =  1.8\n|May low F = 29.7\n|Jun low F = 43.3\n|Jul low F = 47.6\n|Aug low F = 42.2\n|Sep low F = 32.1\n|Oct low F = 12.5\n|Nov low F = \u22127.3\n|Dec low F = \u22129.9\n|year low F =\n\n|Jan record low F = \u221274\n|Feb record low F = \u221265\n|Mar record low F = -54\n|Apr record low F = -38\n|May record low F = -12\n|Jun record low F =  25\n|Jul record low F =  32\n|Aug record low F =  25\n|Sep record low F =  6\n|Oct record low F = -23\n|Nov record low F = -49\n|Dec record low F = -58\n|year record low F=\n\n|precipitation colour= green\n|Jan precipitation inch=1.15\n|Feb precipitation inch=1.13\n|Mar precipitation inch=0.92\n|Apr precipitation inch=1.59\n|May precipitation inch=1.48\n|Jun precipitation inch=1.33\n|Jul precipitation inch=2.66\n|Aug precipitation inch=4.50\n|Sep precipitation inch=4.35\n|Oct precipitation inch=1.72\n|Nov precipitation inch=0.55\n|Dec precipitation inch=1.67\n|year precipitation inch=\n\n|Jan snow inch = 19.7\n|Feb snow inch = 16.7\n|Mar snow inch = 17.6\n|Apr snow inch = 17.2\n|May snow inch =  4.1\n|Jun snow inch =  0\n|Jul snow inch =  0\n|Aug snow inch =  0\n|Sep snow inch =  3.7\n|Oct snow inch = 17.9\n|Nov snow inch =  9.6\n|Dec snow inch = 27.5\n|year snow inch=\n\n|source 1= <ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ak0260|title= Ambler West, Alaska - Climate Summary|publisher= Western Regional Climate Center|accessdate=May 22, 2012 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\nThe community was named for a tributary of the Kobuk River, which was named for Dr. James M.

Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].\n\n[[File:MET DT5084.jpg|thumb|left|[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38344 Mandala of Chandra, God of the Moon], Nepal (Kathmandu Valley) via The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nA common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]].

Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]\n\n'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.\n\nThe major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tert\u00f6n'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.\n\nEach divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.\n[[File:Medicine Buddha painted mandala with goddess Prajnaparamita in center, 19th century, Rubin.jpg|thumb|upright|left| Painted [[Bhutan]]ese [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[mandala]] with [[Perfection of Wisdom|the goddess Prajnaparamita]] in center, 19th century, [[Rubin Museum of Art]].]]\nBhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.\n\nThe arts and crafts of [[Bhutan]] that represents the exclusive \u201cspirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom\u2019 is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the \u201cthirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan\u201d; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the \u2018[[Folk Heritage Museum]]\u2019 in Thimphu. There is also a \u2018Voluntary Artists Studio\u2019 in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu.

The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.\n\nBy the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences \u2013 pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures \u2013 and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000149285|title=Rehabilitation and preservation of Cambodian performing arts|last=|first=|date=|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tourismcambodia.com/culture/art-and-culture.htm|title=Khmer Art and Culture - Khmer Culture {{!}} Tourism Cambodia|website=www.tourismcambodia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Fronton Cambodge Mus\u00e9e Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]\n\nThe gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works.<ref name=\":2\" /> Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the \u201cdeva-raja\u201d required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign's divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself \u2013 if, it's true, in idealized form \u2013 immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phungtian|first=Charuwan|date=|title=Thai - Cambodian Culture Relationship through Arts|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/thai_cambodian_art.pdf|journal=Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=Magadh University}}</ref>\n\nThe sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power.

Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.[[File:\u6e05 \u6c6a\u606d \u6479\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b\u8096\u50cf \u8ef8-Copy of a Portrait of Zhao Mengfu MET DP216665.jpg|thumb|Copy of a portrait of [[Zhao Mengfu]] (\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|253x253px]]\n\nIn the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (\u8a5e) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].\n\n=== Chinese painting and calligraphy art ===\n'''Chinese painting'''\n\nGongbi and Xieyi are two painting styles in Chinese painting. \n\nGongbi means \"meticulous\", the rich colours and details in the picture are its main features, its content mainly depicts portraits or narratives.

The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. \n\nThe art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].\n\nThe contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. \n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].\n\nOne of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.\n\nThe visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], \"Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.\"\n\nInsight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.\n\nSpecific periods: \t\n\n*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] \u2013 present)\n \t\n*Islamic ascendancy (712\u20131757 [[Common Era|CE]])\n\n*The colonial period (1757\u20131947)\n\n*Modern and Postmodern art in India \n\n*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)\n\n==Indonesian art==\n{{Main article|Indonesian art}}\n{{See|Indonesian culture|List of Indonesian painters}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Prins Panji in een hof met drie vrouwen.

[[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.\nIndonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.\n\n[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]\nOther exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.\n\nIndonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.\n\n[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760\u2013830&nbsp;AD]]\nMost notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.\n\nCalligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.\n\n===Balinese art===\n{{Main article|Balinese art}}\n[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]\n'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''<ref name=\"Eiseman\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Eiseman\n| first=Fred and Margaret\n| title=Woodcarving of Bali\n| publisher=Periplus\n| year=1988\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.\n\nThis groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Geertz\n| first=Hildred\n| title=Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\n| publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n| date=1994\n| isbn=978-0-8248-1679-7\n}}</ref>\nAmong western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings.

The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.\n\n==Japanese art==\n{{Main article|Japanese art|Japanese painting|Ukiyo-e|Japanese sculpture|Ryukyuan lacquerware|Japanese calligraphy|Nihonga|List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)}}\n[[File:Birds and flowers of the four seasons.jpg|thumb|upright=3|left|Four from a set of sixteen sliding room partitions made for a 16th-century Japanese abbot. Typically for later Japanese landscapes, the main focus is on a feature in the foreground.]]\n\n'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.\n\nThe art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''\n[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]\n{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|\u7d75\u753b|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.\n\nThe origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[J\u014dmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&nbsp;BC \u2013 300&nbsp;AD) ''[[d\u014dtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300\u2013700&nbsp;AD).\n\nAncient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal\u2014especially [[bronze]]\u2014and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture \u2013 except for miniaturized works \u2013 had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.\n\n''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning \"floating world\", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term \"Sorrowful World\" (\u6182\u304d\u4e16), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.\n\n==Korean art==\n[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (\uae08\uac15\uc804\ub3c4, \u91d1\u525b\u5168\u5716), Korea, c.1734]]\n\n{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}\n'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.\n\nWhile there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.\n\nThe study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]\u2019s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea's own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''\n\nGenerally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.\n\nThroughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.\n\nThis distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].\n\n'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japan's annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated \"While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this.\"  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}</ref> \n\n'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Laotian art==\n{{Main article|Lao art}}\n[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]\n[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]\n'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].\n\nLao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].\n\nMany beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.\n\n==Nepalese art==\n{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}\nThe ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n==Thai art==\n{{Main article|Thai art}}\n[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]\n'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.\n\nTraditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.\n\nThe Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the \"walking Buddha\" pose.\n\nSukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[P\u0101li|Pali]] texts:\n*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; \n*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;\n*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];\n*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;\n*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;\n*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;\n*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;\n*[[human head|head]] like an egg;\n*Hair like scorpion stingers;\n*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;\n*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;\n*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;\n*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;\n*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.\n\nSukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.\n\n==Tibetan art==\n[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]\n{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}\n\n'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].\n\nAs [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.\n\nTibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]\nA visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.\n\nHistorians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.<ref name=McKay>McKay, Alex.

Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.\n\nThe [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802\u20131945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux Arts de l\u2019Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref>[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History \u2013 A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nTravel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.<ref name=\"vcw\">{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327130249/http://particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx |date=March 27, 2010 }}</ref> A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.<ref name=\"vcw\"/> Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.<ref name=\"vcw\"/>\n\nModern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.\n\n===Vietnamese calligraphy===\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]], which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[T\u1ebft|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.\n\n==Filipino art==\n{{see also|Culture of Philippines|Art of the Philippines}}\n\n[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[Jos\u00e9 Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.\n[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]\nKutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques\u2014sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art. \n\n==Central Asian Art==\n{{Main article|Central Asian art}}The [[Central Asian art|Central Asian Art]] has gained much fame.

Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art.

Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.\n\nThe major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tert\u00f6n'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.\n\nEach divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.\n[[File:Medicine Buddha painted mandala with goddess Prajnaparamita in center, 19th century, Rubin.jpg|thumb|upright|left| Painted [[Bhutan]]ese [[Bhaisajyaguru|Medicine Buddha]] [[mandala]] with [[Perfection of Wisdom|the goddess Prajnaparamita]] in center, 19th century, [[Rubin Museum of Art]].]]\nBhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.\n\nThe arts and crafts of [[Bhutan]] that represents the exclusive \u201cspirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom\u2019 is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the \u201cthirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan\u201d; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the \u2018[[Folk Heritage Museum]]\u2019 in Thimphu. There is also a \u2018Voluntary Artists Studio\u2019 in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu.

Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000149285|title=Rehabilitation and preservation of Cambodian performing arts|last=|first=|date=|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground.

The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the \u201cdeva-raja\u201d required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign's divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself \u2013 if, it's true, in idealized form \u2013 immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phungtian|first=Charuwan|date=|title=Thai - Cambodian Culture Relationship through Arts|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/thai_cambodian_art.pdf|journal=Buddha Dharma Education Association Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=Magadh University}}</ref>\n\nThe sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power.

Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s.

Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (\u8d99\u5b5f\u982b) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].\n\n=== Chinese painting and calligraphy art ===\n'''Chinese painting'''\n\nGongbi and Xieyi are two painting styles in Chinese painting. \n\nGongbi means \"meticulous\", the rich colours and details in the picture are its main features, its content mainly depicts portraits or narratives.

The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. \n\nThe art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].\n\nThe contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. \n\nDuring the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].\n\nOne of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.\n\nThe visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], \"Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail.\"\n\nInsight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.\n\nSpecific periods: \t\n\n*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] \u2013 present)\n \t\n*Islamic ascendancy (712\u20131757 [[Common Era|CE]])\n\n*The colonial period (1757\u20131947)\n\n*Modern and Postmodern art in India \n\n*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)\n\n==Indonesian art==\n{{Main article|Indonesian art}}\n{{See|Indonesian culture|List of Indonesian painters}}\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Prins Panji in een hof met drie vrouwen.

[[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.\nIndonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.\n\n[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]\nOther exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.\n\nIndonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.\n\n[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760\u2013830&nbsp;AD]]\nMost notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.\n\nCalligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]].

From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''<ref name=\"Eiseman\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Eiseman\n| first=Fred and Margaret\n| title=Woodcarving of Bali\n| publisher=Periplus\n| year=1988\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.\n\nThis groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Geertz\n| first=Hildred\n| title=Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\n| publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n| date=1994\n| isbn=978-0-8248-1679-7\n}}</ref>\nAmong western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings.

Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.\n\nThe art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''\n[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]\n{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|\u7d75\u753b|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.\n\nThe origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[J\u014dmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&nbsp;BC \u2013 300&nbsp;AD) ''[[d\u014dtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300\u2013700&nbsp;AD).\n\nAncient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal\u2014especially [[bronze]]\u2014and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture \u2013 except for miniaturized works \u2013 had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.\n\n''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning \"floating world\", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term \"Sorrowful World\" (\u6182\u304d\u4e16), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.\n\n==Korean art==\n[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt.

Because of [[Korea]]\u2019s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea's own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''\n\nGenerally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.\n\nThroughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.\n\nThis distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].\n\n'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japan's annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated \"While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this.\"  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}</ref> \n\n'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions.

Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].\n\nMany beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.\n\n==Nepalese art==\n{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}\nThe ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n==Thai art==\n{{Main article|Thai art}}\n[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]\n'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.\n\nTraditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.\n\nThe Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the \"walking Buddha\" pose.\n\nSukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[P\u0101li|Pali]] texts:\n*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; \n*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;\n*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];\n*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;\n*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;\n*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;\n*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;\n*[[human head|head]] like an egg;\n*Hair like scorpion stingers;\n*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;\n*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;\n*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;\n*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;\n*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.\n\nSukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.\n\n==Tibetan art==\n[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]\n{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}\n\n'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].\n\nAs [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.\n\nTibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.\n[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]\nA visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.\n\nHistorians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.<ref name=McKay>McKay, Alex.

Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}</ref>  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the Qing Dynasty, \"a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity.\"<ref name=McKay/>\n\n==Vietnamese art==\n[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum surface.gif|thumb|upright|Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface, 2nd to 3rd century BCE]]\n\n{{Main article|Vietnamese art}}\n'''Vietnamese art''' is from one of the oldest of such cultures in the Southeast Asia region. A rich artistic heritage that dates to prehistoric times and includes: silk painting, sculpture, pottery, ceramics, woodblock prints, architecture, music, dance and theatre.\n[[File:To Ngoc Van thieu nu ben hoa hue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|T\u00f4 Ng\u1ecdc V\u00e2n, ''Thi\u1ebfu n\u1eef b\u00ean hoa hu\u1ec7 (Young Woman with Lily)'', 1943, oil]]\n[[Vietnamese art|Traditional Vietnamese art]] is art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n drums]]) to post-[[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] art which was strongly influenced by [[Buddhist art|Chinese Buddhist art]], among other philosophies such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.\n\nThe [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802\u20131945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux Arts de l\u2019Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].<ref>[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History \u2013 A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nTravel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.<ref name=\"vcw\">{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Th\u1ebf Gi\u1edbi Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327130249/http://particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx |date=March 27, 2010 }}</ref> A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.<ref name=\"vcw\"/> Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.<ref name=\"vcw\"/>\n\nModern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.\n\n===Vietnamese calligraphy===\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]], which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[T\u1ebft|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.\n\n==Filipino art==\n{{see also|Culture of Philippines|Art of the Philippines}}\n\n[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[Jos\u00e9 Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.\n[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]\nKutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques\u2014sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art. \n\n==Central Asian Art==\n{{Main article|Central Asian art}}The [[Central Asian art|Central Asian Art]] has gained much fame.
