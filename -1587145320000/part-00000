This causes the planet to collapse into chaos, as without sleep the aliens turned violent. To restore order and continue her experiments, she begins stealing the chemical that allows sleep from human brains, carrying this out in violent periods of Earth's history so her experiment's after-effects would go unnoticed. When carrying this out during the [[Luddite]] rebellion, her operation is co-opted into the Master's attempt at hijacking the Industrial Revolution and killing the Sixth Doctor. The Doctor and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], [[Peri Brown|Peri]] ([[Nicola Bryant]]), are shocked, as they believed the Master to have been destroyed. Eventually, the Doctor traps the Rani and the Master in the Rani's TARDIS, where an embryo of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]] '' starts to grow as the result of a time spillage. Her operation is thwarted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/markrani/detail.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide \u2013 The Mark of the Rani \u2013 Details|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===''Time and the Rani'' (1987)===\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (16583737322).jpg|thumb|right|The Rani's costume in this serial, on show at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nIn ''Time and the Rani'', the Rani uses a time funnel to trap the Doctor's TARDIS. The ferocity and resulting turbulence have devastating effect, forcing him to regenerate into the [[Seventh Doctor]]. When the Doctor ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) wakes up, he figures out what the Rani is doing, and a [[Tetrap]] (from the planet Tetrapyriarbus) knocks him out when he threatens to smash a piece of machinery. The Rani then injects the Doctor with an amnesia drug, and disguises herself as the Doctor's companion, [[Melanie Bush|Mel]] ([[Bonnie Langford]]); she later uses a hologram of Mel to get the Doctor to return a vital piece of machinery.\n\nIt is revealed that the Rani plans to use an approaching asteroid composed of strange matter and various equations calculated by assorted geniuses from across history\u2014including the Doctor\u2014to turn the planet into a temporal manipulator that would allow her to manipulate evolution on a cosmic scale. This plan is thwarted when the Doctor is able to delay the missile the Rani would have used to destroy the asteroid, causing it to just miss its target. The Rani manages to escape in her TARDIS; however, the Tetraps are also in there, and have her take them back to Tetrapyriarbus to help them with their larger tasks.\n\nIn the novelisation written by Pip and Jane Baker, it is revealed that the Rani, and the Master, escaped the growing T-Rex due to the same time spillage that made it mature; it grew so rapidly that it broke its spine on the ceiling of the Rani's TARDIS.\n\n===''Dimensions in Time'' (1993)===\nO'Mara reprised her role as the Rani in ''Dimensions in Time'', which was broadcast over two nights as part of Children in Need for the 30th anniversary of ''Doctor Who''. In this story, the Rani attempts to trap the first seven incarnations of the Doctor in a time loop. She is also seen to be travelling with a companion called Cyrian.\n\n==Other appearances==\n[[Pip and Jane Baker]] wrote the Rani as the lead in the [[BBV]] audio drama ''The Rani Reaps the Whirlwind'', following on from ''Time and the Rani'', and also wrote her as the villain in a [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style children's game book entitled ''Race Against Time''.\n\nThe Rani appears in the ''[[Virgin Missing Adventures]]'' spin-off novel ''[[State of Change]]'' (1994) by [[Christopher Bulis]]. Here, the Master escapes the Rani's TARDIS in ''The Mark of the Rani'' by splitting the console room from the rest of her TARDIS, leaving the Rani adrift in a space-time bubble until she encounters a benign entity that creates a distorted pocket reality where the Egyptians possess 20th-century technology due to their access to the databanks of a duplicate of the Doctor's TARDIS console.

This causes the planet to collapse into chaos, as without sleep the aliens turned violent. To restore order and continue her experiments, she begins stealing the chemical that allows sleep from human brains, carrying this out in violent periods of Earth's history so her experiment's after-effects would go unnoticed. When carrying this out during the [[Luddite]] rebellion, her operation is co-opted into the Master's attempt at hijacking the Industrial Revolution and killing the Sixth Doctor. The Doctor and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], [[Peri Brown|Peri]] ([[Nicola Bryant]]), are shocked, as they believed the Master to have been destroyed.

The ferocity and resulting turbulence have devastating effect, forcing him to regenerate into the [[Seventh Doctor]]. When the Doctor ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) wakes up, he figures out what the Rani is doing, and a [[Tetrap]] (from the planet Tetrapyriarbus) knocks him out when he threatens to smash a piece of machinery. The Rani then injects the Doctor with an amnesia drug, and disguises herself as the Doctor's companion, [[Melanie Bush|Mel]] ([[Bonnie Langford]]); she later uses a hologram of Mel to get the Doctor to return a vital piece of machinery.\n\nIt is revealed that the Rani plans to use an approaching asteroid composed of strange matter and various equations calculated by assorted geniuses from across history\u2014including the Doctor\u2014to turn the planet into a temporal manipulator that would allow her to manipulate evolution on a cosmic scale. This plan is thwarted when the Doctor is able to delay the missile the Rani would have used to destroy the asteroid, causing it to just miss its target. The Rani manages to escape in her TARDIS; however, the Tetraps are also in there, and have her take them back to Tetrapyriarbus to help them with their larger tasks.\n\nIn the novelisation written by Pip and Jane Baker, it is revealed that the Rani, and the Master, escaped the growing T-Rex due to the same time spillage that made it mature; it grew so rapidly that it broke its spine on the ceiling of the Rani's TARDIS.\n\n===''Dimensions in Time'' (1993)===\nO'Mara reprised her role as the Rani in ''Dimensions in Time'', which was broadcast over two nights as part of Children in Need for the 30th anniversary of ''Doctor Who''. In this story, the Rani attempts to trap the first seven incarnations of the Doctor in a time loop. She is also seen to be travelling with a companion called Cyrian.\n\n==Other appearances==\n[[Pip and Jane Baker]] wrote the Rani as the lead in the [[BBV]] audio drama ''The Rani Reaps the Whirlwind'', following on from ''Time and the Rani'', and also wrote her as the villain in a [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style children's game book entitled ''Race Against Time''.\n\nThe Rani appears in the ''[[Virgin Missing Adventures]]'' spin-off novel ''[[State of Change]]'' (1994) by [[Christopher Bulis]]. Here, the Master escapes the Rani's TARDIS in ''The Mark of the Rani'' by splitting the console room from the rest of her TARDIS, leaving the Rani adrift in a space-time bubble until she encounters a benign entity that creates a distorted pocket reality where the Egyptians possess 20th-century technology due to their access to the databanks of a duplicate of the Doctor's TARDIS console. The Rani tries her hand at political machinations in this reality before the intervention of the Doctor breaks her control over the entity, at which point she escapes in her repaired TARDIS.\n\nThe Rani is mentioned in BBC Books' ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures|Eighth Doctor Adventure]]'' novel ''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'' (2000) by [[Peter Anghelides]] and [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]].

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]]. It is also the 9th [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchise]] of all time, with an estimated revenue above {{US$|36 billion|long=no}}.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Mario franchise characters}}\n\n== Video games ==\n{{Main|List of video games featuring Mario}}\n\n=== Origin games ===\n\n==== ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' ====\n{{Main|Donkey Kong (video game)}}\n[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|125px|A replica of a ''Donkey Kong'' arcade cabinet.]]\n\nAfter the commercial failure of ''[[Radar Scope]]'', Nintendo's company president referred to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] to create an arcade game to save the company. Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games. It continued on the Wii as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', on the 3DS as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and on the [[Wii U]] as ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

This gameplay is further offered by the level creator game ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', released on [[Wii U]] in 2015. A sequel, ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', was released on Nintendo Switch in June 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the team behind ''New Super Mario Bros.'' released ''[[Super Mario Run]]'' that became Nintendo's first real [[smartphone]] game and one of the few instances a ''Mario'' game was developed for non-Nintendo hardware.<ref name=\"MarioRun\">{{cite web|last1=Ingraham|first1=Nathan|title='Super Mario Run' is just as much fun as we'd hoped|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/08/super-mario-run-iphone-hands-on/|publisher=Engadet|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Puzzle games ===\n{{Main|List of Mario puzzle games}}\n\n==== ''Dr. Mario'' series ====\n[[File:Dr. Mario series logo.png|thumb|The ''Dr. Mario'' series logo.]]\n\n{{nihongo foot|'''''Dr. Mario'''''|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa|Dokut\u0101 Mario|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (stylized as ''D\u211e.

The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each [[level (video gaming)|level]].\n\n<!-- Titles -->\nThere have been 4 ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' games released for home consoles and two portable games, for a total of six original titles.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series until ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' in 2007, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.

Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]].

Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the Mario franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into four kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario Land]]''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Dream Team''.\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each [[level (video gaming)|level]].\n\n<!-- Titles -->\nThere have been 4 ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' games released for home consoles and two portable games, for a total of six original titles.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series until ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' in 2007, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.

It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990.

Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]].

Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the Mario franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into 4 kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario Land]]''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Dream Team''.\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

New York''''', 500 U.S. 352 (1991), was a decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], which held that a prosecutor may dismiss jurors who are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]] from juries that will consider Spanish-language testimony.\n\n[[Peremptory challenge]]s are used to remove jurors thought to be undesirable for virtually any reason by either side in a court case. However, in ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'' (1986), the Supreme Court ruled that peremptory challenges may not be used to remove jurors because of their race. In ''Hernandez'', the Supreme Court had to decide whether the peremptory exclusion of two Hispanic jurors was tantamount to exclusion because of race&mdash;and therefore violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].The case is recognized as expanding a ''Batson'' challenge to a peremptory strike based on a juror's ethnicity.<ref>U.S. v.

Hernandez, 140 A.D.2d 543 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988).</ref> He appealed his conviction, claiming that under the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision under ''Batson v. Kentucky'',<ref>Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).</ref> the prosecutor unconstitutionally used peremptory strikes against jury panel members who had Hispanic last names.<ref name=\":0\" /> On appeal, the court found that because the prosecutor had only challenged the three potential jurors with Hispanic surnames.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358 (1991).</ref> However, the appellate court found the prosecutor has a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenge because the stricken jurors either had a relative prosecuted by the district attorney's office or spoke Spanish and may not accept the translated testimony as final.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHernandez proceeded with his ''Batson'' claim and appealed to the [[New York Court of Appeals]].<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350 (N.Y. 1990)</ref> New York's highest court of appeals agreed with the appellate court that Hernandez made a ''prima facie'' case of discrimination.<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 353 (N.Y. 1990).</ref> The court did not find that striking a juror based on their language alone was [[reversible error]] as it was a \"legitimate neutral ground\" for the prosecutor to be concerned of the Spanish-speaking jurors fidelity to a translate court record.<ref name=\":2\">People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 356 (N.Y. 1990).</ref> The majority noted that the trial judge was present during the entirety of the questioning and was satisfied with the prosecutor's actions as the stricken jurors' body-language signaled doubt.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Judith Kaye|Judge Kaye]] authored the dissent, criticizing the majority for the diminished protections of ''Batson'' for New York and for deciding the case on federal and not state law.<ref name=\":3\">People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 360 (N.Y. 1990) (Kaye, J., dissenting).</ref> Rather than allow ''Batson's'' contours be defined over decades of litigation, Kaye argued that deciding the matter on state law would allow clearer protections earlier for New York residents.<ref name=\":3\" /> On the merits, Kaye believed too much deference was provided to the trial court's decision and was concerned that while the prosecutor expressed an interest in removing Spanish-speakers because of the interpreter there was no indication that any non-Latino jurors were asked if they spoke Spanish as well.<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 363 (N.Y. 1990) (Kaye, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court granted a [[Certiorari|writ of certiorari]] to determine if a Latino juror struck from jury service because of their Spanish language in a court translated proceeding violated a defendant's ''Batson'' protections.<ref>People v.

New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645) 1990 WL 10013132.</ref>\n\n=== Oral Argument ===\nAt oral argument, Hernandez argued that it is a ''per se'' ''Batson'' violation to discriminate on language.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 4, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645).</ref> Hernandez believed that every bilingual juror would express the same hesitance that the striked jurors in his case would because of their language ability. The Court was concerned with line drawing issues of potential multiple dialects or languages for a given foreign country and if a prosecutor could ever use a peremptory strike against a bilingual juror.\n\nNew York argued that Hernandez's position was against Supreme Court jurisprudence for three main reasons: it uses the juror's answer as proof of a prosecutor's intent to discriminate, it prevents individualized assessment of jurors in favor of group stereotypes, and it would create no ability for prosecutors to excuse certain jurors.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at *26-27, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645).</ref>\n\n=== Plurality Decision ===\n[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] wrote the plurality opinion. After outlining the facts of the case and procedural history of the case, the Court moved on to the Court's jurisprudence on ''Batson''. It reiterated ''Batson's'' three step process: first, a defendant must make a ''prima facie'' case of racial discrimination, second, if it is made the burden shifts to the prosecutor to make a race-neutral showing for the strike, and finally the trial judge make a determination if the defendant's claim stands.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-59 (1991).</ref> Even though Hernandez did not make a ''prima facie'' showing before the prosecutor presented a race-neutral reasoning, the Court found this did not impact the analysis because it rested with the trial judge's determination.\n\nThe Court side-stepped Hernandez's argument on the correlation between Spanish-speaking ability and ethnicity because of the additional factors the prosecutor articulated in his reasoning for striking the two Latino jurors.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 360-61 (1991).</ref> Kennedy argued that even assuming all bilingual speakers would hesitate it did not fail a race-neutral analysis because it does not show an intent by the prosecutor to remove all bilingual Latinos and a negative impact does not violate race neutrality.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 362-63 (1991).</ref>\n\nThe trial court's decision is afforded a high level of deference under ''Batson'', and the Court assumed that the trial judge took into account the case-specific factors in making the decision to accept the prosecutor's justification: the high concentration of Spanish speakers in the local population, Spanish as the predominant language for many in that region, the ethnic backgrounds of the parties and witnesses, and the prosecutor's swift justification. This level of deference was based on a trial judge's ability to decide credibility questions that cannot be reviewed solely through the record on the appeal.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 363-66 (1991).</ref> The plurality did not find any reason that the trial judge's decision presented a clear error and was a permissible view under the evidence.\n\nIn a closing dicta discussion, the plurality cited linguistic studies noting the complexity of language and bilingual distinctions. It further counseled that excluding bilinguals is unwise and may be unconstitutional under a different set of facts. Specifically, Kennedy outlined that creating a blanket policy regardless of the case's specific facts or for particular ethnic groups in certain communities language could be treated similarly to skin color under ''Batson''. However, this was not that case.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 370-72 (1991).</ref>\n\n=== Concurrence ===\nJustices [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]] and [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] concurred in the plurality's judgement. O'Connor agreed with the plurality's deference to the trial court's decision, but believed it went to far in deciding the constitutional question.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 372 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring).</ref> After outlining the Court's jurisprudence under ''Batson'' and ''[[Washington v. Davis]]'', O'Connor limited the Equal Protection Clause analysis for racial discrimination to race only. \"No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race . . . [it] does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race.\"<ref name=\"Hernandez v. New York 1991\">Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring).</ref> O'Connor reasoned that if a trial judge accepted a prosecutor's nonracial explanation, then there was nothing more for an appeals court to decide on a ''Batson'' claim.<ref name=\"Hernandez v. New York 1991\"/>\n\n=== Dissent ===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]] dissented and Justice [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]] joined. Under ''Batson'', Stevens argued that a prosecutor who attempts to rebut a ''prima facie'' showing of discrimination must do so with \"'legitimate reasons' that are 'related to the particular case to be tried.'\"<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 376 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens found the Court erred by allowing an illegitimate explanation for the prosecutor's actions that went to the heart of ''Batson's'' protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 377 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Further, Stevens found that the prosecutor's justification would disproportionately affect Spanish-speaking jurors, alternatives were available to address the prosecutor's concerns, and his reasoning should be viewed skeptically because he did not use a for cause challenge.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 379 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nJustice [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]] dissented in a separate statement agreeing with Justice Stevens' dissent on the prosecutor's insufficient explanation for dispelling an inference of racial animus.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\n== Criticism of the Decision ==\nThe decision received immediate attention with a New York Times article that broke down the arguments and the court's reasoning.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/29/us/high-court-upholds-exclusion-of-bilingual-jurors.html|title=High Court Upholds Exclusion of Bilingual Jurors|date=May 21, 1991|work=New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Law professors were also skeptical of the decision and its implications. Professor Juan Perea argued that the interconnection between race and language is not properly addressed and that the Supreme Court should have found the prosecutor's peremptory strikes not race-neutral.<ref>Juan F. Perea, Hernandez v. New York: ''Courts, Prosecutors, and the Fear of Spanish'', 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 3-5 (1992).</ref> Professor Deborah Ramirez highlighted that this decision could permit bilinguals to systematically be removed from juries and the pervasiveimpact that may have on Latinos.<ref>Deborah A. Ramierz, ''Excluded Voices: The Disenfranchisement of Ethnic Groups from Jury Service'', 1993 Wis. L. Rev. 761, 762-63 (1993).</ref> Professor Alfredo Mirand\u00e9 furthered this research on \"bilingualism as an immutable characteristic\" under Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Doctrine and noted lower courts had expanded the Supreme Court's reasoning to allow peremptory challenges when a juror understands a foreign language when the translation is disputed at trial.<ref>Alfredo Mirande, ''\"Now that I Speak English, no me Dejan Hablar [I'm not Allowed to Speak']\": The Implications of'' Hernandez v. New York, 18 Chicano-Latino L. Rev. 115, 147 n.187 (1996) (citing ''Pemberthy v. Beyer'', 19 F.3d 857, 858 (3rd Cir. 1994)).</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court has not revisited the question of potential discrimination towards bilingual or multilingual jurors since which has created confusion for lower courts. An examination of twenty years after Hernandez v.

XIV]]\n}}\n'''''Hernandez v. New York''''', 500 U.S. 352 (1991), was a decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]], which held that a prosecutor may dismiss jurors who are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]] from juries that will consider Spanish-language testimony.\n\n[[Peremptory challenge]]s are used to remove jurors thought to be undesirable for virtually any reason by either side in a court case. However, in ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'' (1986), the Supreme Court ruled that peremptory challenges may not be used to remove jurors because of their race. In ''Hernandez'', the Supreme Court had to decide whether the peremptory exclusion of two Hispanic jurors was tantamount to exclusion because of race&mdash;and therefore violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].The case is recognized as expanding a ''Batson'' challenge to a peremptory strike based on a juror's ethnicity.<ref>U.S. v. Fuentes-Montijo, 68 F.3d 352, 354-55 (9th Cir. 1995)</ref>\n\n== Procedural History of the Case ==\nDinosio Hernandez was convicted by a jury of attempted murder on January 30, 1987 in [[New York Supreme Court]].<ref name=\":0\">People v. Hernandez, 140 A.D.2d 543 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988).</ref> He appealed his conviction, claiming that under the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision under ''Batson v. Kentucky'',<ref>Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).</ref> the prosecutor unconstitutionally used peremptory strikes against jury panel members who had Hispanic last names.<ref name=\":0\" /> On appeal, the court found that because the prosecutor had only challenged the three potential jurors with Hispanic surnames.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358 (1991).</ref> However, the appellate court found the prosecutor has a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenge because the stricken jurors either had a relative prosecuted by the district attorney's office or spoke Spanish and may not accept the translated testimony as final.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHernandez proceeded with his ''Batson'' claim and appealed to the [[New York Court of Appeals]].<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350 (N.Y. 1990)</ref> New York's highest court of appeals agreed with the appellate court that Hernandez made a ''prima facie'' case of discrimination.<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 353 (N.Y. 1990).</ref> The court did not find that striking a juror based on their language alone was [[reversible error]] as it was a \"legitimate neutral ground\" for the prosecutor to be concerned of the Spanish-speaking jurors fidelity to a translate court record.<ref name=\":2\">People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 356 (N.Y. 1990).</ref> The majority noted that the trial judge was present during the entirety of the questioning and was satisfied with the prosecutor's actions as the stricken jurors' body-language signaled doubt.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Judith Kaye|Judge Kaye]] authored the dissent, criticizing the majority for the diminished protections of ''Batson'' for New York and for deciding the case on federal and not state law.<ref name=\":3\">People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 360 (N.Y. 1990) (Kaye, J., dissenting).</ref> Rather than allow ''Batson's'' contours be defined over decades of litigation, Kaye argued that deciding the matter on state law would allow clearer protections earlier for New York residents.<ref name=\":3\" /> On the merits, Kaye believed too much deference was provided to the trial court's decision and was concerned that while the prosecutor expressed an interest in removing Spanish-speakers because of the interpreter there was no indication that any non-Latino jurors were asked if they spoke Spanish as well.<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 363 (N.Y. 1990) (Kaye, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court granted a [[Certiorari|writ of certiorari]] to determine if a Latino juror struck from jury service because of their Spanish language in a court translated proceeding violated a defendant's ''Batson'' protections.<ref>People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350 (N.Y. 1990), ''cert. granted'', Hernandez v. New York, 111 S. Ct. 242 (1990) (No. 89-7645).</ref>\n\n== Arguments at the Supreme Court ==\n\n=== Amicus Curiae ===\nThe [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund]] (MALDEF) filed an [[amicus curiae]] on behalf of Hernandez.<ref>Brief for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund et. al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645) 1990 WL 10013132.</ref> MALDEF's argument focused on the wide usage of Spanish by Hispanics and the sociolinguistic evidence that supported Hispanics as living in a world where they are constantly required to switch between Spanish and English without the ability to turn off the ability to speak either.<ref>Brief for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund et. al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner at *6-10, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645) 1990 WL 10013132.</ref>  It forecasted that Hispanic jurors would become an \"endangered species\" if they are presumed to be biased based off a common attribute.<ref>Brief for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund et. al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner at *16, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645) 1990 WL 10013132.</ref>\n\n=== Oral Argument ===\nAt oral argument, Hernandez argued that it is a ''per se'' ''Batson'' violation to discriminate on language.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at 4, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645).</ref> Hernandez believed that every bilingual juror would express the same hesitance that the striked jurors in his case would because of their language ability. The Court was concerned with line drawing issues of potential multiple dialects or languages for a given foreign country and if a prosecutor could ever use a peremptory strike against a bilingual juror.\n\nNew York argued that Hernandez's position was against Supreme Court jurisprudence for three main reasons: it uses the juror's answer as proof of a prosecutor's intent to discriminate, it prevents individualized assessment of jurors in favor of group stereotypes, and it would create no ability for prosecutors to excuse certain jurors.<ref>Transcript of Oral Argument at *26-27, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645).</ref>\n\n=== Plurality Decision ===\n[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] wrote the plurality opinion. After outlining the facts of the case and procedural history of the case, the Court moved on to the Court's jurisprudence on ''Batson''. It reiterated ''Batson's'' three step process: first, a defendant must make a ''prima facie'' case of racial discrimination, second, if it is made the burden shifts to the prosecutor to make a race-neutral showing for the strike, and finally the trial judge make a determination if the defendant's claim stands.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-59 (1991).</ref> Even though Hernandez did not make a ''prima facie'' showing before the prosecutor presented a race-neutral reasoning, the Court found this did not impact the analysis because it rested with the trial judge's determination.\n\nThe Court side-stepped Hernandez's argument on the correlation between Spanish-speaking ability and ethnicity because of the additional factors the prosecutor articulated in his reasoning for striking the two Latino jurors.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 360-61 (1991).</ref> Kennedy argued that even assuming all bilingual speakers would hesitate it did not fail a race-neutral analysis because it does not show an intent by the prosecutor to remove all bilingual Latinos and a negative impact does not violate race neutrality.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 362-63 (1991).</ref>\n\nThe trial court's decision is afforded a high level of deference under ''Batson'', and the Court assumed that the trial judge took into account the case-specific factors in making the decision to accept the prosecutor's justification: the high concentration of Spanish speakers in the local population, Spanish as the predominant language for many in that region, the ethnic backgrounds of the parties and witnesses, and the prosecutor's swift justification. This level of deference was based on a trial judge's ability to decide credibility questions that cannot be reviewed solely through the record on the appeal.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 363-66 (1991).</ref> The plurality did not find any reason that the trial judge's decision presented a clear error and was a permissible view under the evidence.\n\nIn a closing dicta discussion, the plurality cited linguistic studies noting the complexity of language and bilingual distinctions. It further counseled that excluding bilinguals is unwise and may be unconstitutional under a different set of facts. Specifically, Kennedy outlined that creating a blanket policy regardless of the case's specific facts or for particular ethnic groups in certain communities language could be treated similarly to skin color under ''Batson''. However, this was not that case.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 370-72 (1991).</ref>\n\n=== Concurrence ===\nJustices [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]] and [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]] concurred in the plurality's judgement. O'Connor agreed with the plurality's deference to the trial court's decision, but believed it went to far in deciding the constitutional question.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 372 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring).</ref> After outlining the Court's jurisprudence under ''Batson'' and ''[[Washington v. Davis]]'', O'Connor limited the Equal Protection Clause analysis for racial discrimination to race only. \"No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race . . . [it] does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race.\"<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring).</ref> O'Connor reasoned that if a trial judge accepted a prosecutor's nonracial explanation, then there was nothing more for an appeals court to decide on a ''Batson'' claim.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring).</ref>\n\n=== Dissent ===\nJustice [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]] dissented and Justice [[Thurgood Marshall|Marshall]] joined. Under ''Batson'', Stevens argued that a prosecutor who attempts to rebut a ''prima facie'' showing of discrimination must do so with \"'legitimate reasons' that are 'related to the particular case to be tried.'\"<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 376 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Stevens found the Court erred by allowing an illegitimate explanation for the prosecutor's actions that went to the heart of ''Batson's'' protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 377 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref> Further, Stevens found that the prosecutor's justification would disproportionately affect Spanish-speaking jurors, alternatives were available to address the prosecutor's concerns, and his reasoning should be viewed skeptically because he did not use a for cause challenge.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 379 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\nJustice [[Harry Blackmun|Blackmun]] dissented in a separate statement agreeing with Justice Stevens' dissent on the prosecutor's insufficient explanation for dispelling an inference of racial animus.<ref>Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).</ref>\n\n== Criticism of the Decision ==\nThe decision received immediate attention with a New York Times article that broke down the arguments and the court's reasoning.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/29/us/high-court-upholds-exclusion-of-bilingual-jurors.html|title=High Court Upholds Exclusion of Bilingual Jurors|date=May 21, 1991|work=New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Law professors were also skeptical of the decision and its implications. Professor Juan Perea argued that the interconnection between race and language is not properly addressed and that the Supreme Court should have found the prosecutor's peremptory strikes not race-neutral.<ref>Juan F. Perea, Hernandez v. New York: ''Courts, Prosecutors, and the Fear of Spanish'', 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 3-5 (1992).</ref> Professor Deborah Ramirez highlighted that this decision could permit bilinguals to systematically be removed from juries and the pervasiveimpact that may have on Latinos.<ref>Deborah A. Ramierz, ''Excluded Voices: The Disenfranchisement of Ethnic Groups from Jury Service'', 1993 Wis. L. Rev. 761, 762-63 (1993).</ref> Professor Alfredo Mirand\u00e9 furthered this research on \"bilingualism as an immutable characteristic\" under Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Doctrine and noted lower courts had expanded the Supreme Court's reasoning to allow peremptory challenges when a juror understands a foreign language when the translation is disputed at trial.<ref>Alfredo Mirande, ''\"Now that I Speak English, no me Dejan Hablar [I'm not Allowed to Speak']\": The Implications of'' Hernandez v. New York, 18 Chicano-Latino L. Rev. 115, 147 n.187 (1996) (citing ''Pemberthy v. Beyer'', 19 F.3d 857, 858 (3rd Cir. 1994)).</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court has not revisited the question of potential discrimination towards bilingual or multilingual jurors since which has created confusion for lower courts. An examination of twenty years after Hernandez v. New York in California courts found the case's reasoning to be \"an arbitrary and flawed tool\" but California courts were hesitant to rule contrary.<ref>Farida Ali, ''Multilingual Prosepective Jurors: Assessing California Standards Twenty Years After'' Hernandez v.
