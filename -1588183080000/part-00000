The Commission felt that the result of Diaz's [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] test, an enormous 175, was a contributing factor in his performance during the fight. Commission Chairman Dr. Tony Alamo said that while a result of 15 is considered positive, the NSAC has a threshold of 50 for athletes.

Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

The southern part of Moreton Bay also contains smaller islands such as [[St Helena Island National Park|St Helena Island]], [[Peel Island]], [[Coochiemudlo Island]], [[Russell Island (Moreton Bay)|Russell Island]], [[Lamb Island, Queensland|Lamb Island]] and [[Macleay Island]].\n\nThe city of Brisbane is hilly.<ref name=\"thenandnow\">{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=60 }}</ref> The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the [[Taylor Range (Queensland)|Herbert Taylor Range]], such as the summit of [[Mount Coot-tha, Queensland|Mount Coot-tha]], reaching up to {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and the smaller [[Enoggera Hill]].

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]].\n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Brisbane}}\n[[File:Chinatown Mall, Brisbane.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Chinatown, Brisbane|Brisbane's Chinatown]].

The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the [[Moreton Bay]] floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.\n\nThe Brisbane River is a wide [[tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at [[Moreton Bay]] in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]].\n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Brisbane}}\n[[File:Chinatown Mall, Brisbane.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Chinatown, Brisbane|Brisbane's Chinatown]].

Maize diversity in Mexico continues to be maintained and managed by smallholder farmers who participate in traditional seed sharing networks. Maize landraces in Mexico are conserved in place, or in-situ, by farmers who continue to grow them in their fields. Commercial maize seed is planted on less than one-fourth of Mexico\u2019s 8 million hectares of arable land<ref name=\":9\" />. The majority of farmers in Mexico use, save, and exchange the seed of traditional maize landraces along with \u201ccreolized\u201d (hybridized or cross-pollinated) commercial [[Cultivar|cultivars]], which are typically planted in small (<5 ha) rain-fed fields<ref name=\":9\" />. \n\nAn estimated 18 percent of maize cultivation in Mexico takes place in the highlands, and maize agro-climates in the highland regions are most at risk from climate change.<ref name=\":4\" /> Many scientists are concerned about the effects climate change poses on maize genetic diversity and the negative impacts that continued maize [[germplasm]] loss will have, not only on Mexican agriculture, but worldwide, as maize is the most widely grown crop in the world.<ref name=\":7\" /> Bellon et al.

Key strategies include crop diversification and the implementation of more resilient coffee production systems. Farmer education, access to information, health, and equity factors all play important roles in adaptation responses as well.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Yet, there are also large-scale and global factors at play, such as international trade markets, which are often volatile, that are beyond farmers\u2019 control. A handful of coffee companies, NGOs, and agencies have initiated training and education programs for Mexican farmers to better respond to climate change.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Global Impacts ===\nClimate change threatens not only food and economic security in Mexico, but is also tied to much larger, global processes. In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />.

In 2017, the United States imported $13.3 billion of fruits and vegetables from Mexico.<ref name=\":6\" /> Declining crop yields in Mexico due to climate change will ultimately impact global trade networks, national economies, and food security in countries that are, perhaps, geographically distant; yet through free-trade policies such as [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and [[United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement|USMCA]], have become highly dependent on Mexican agriculture.\n\n=== Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies ===\nThe Mexican government\u2019s climate change program explicitly identifies \u201cthe adoption and implementation of sustainable agriculture\u201d as a key adaptation strategy<ref name=\":9\" />. Sustainable agriculture can take many forms. One type of strategy that has been proposed includes changing farmers\u2019 agricultural practices. For example, changing the timing of irrigation and crop planting, introducing new landraces and cultivars by extending seed-sharing networks, and adopting biodiversity friendly farming practices that increase [[agroecosystem]] resilience<ref name=\":9\" />. Evidence suggests that smallholder farmers in southern Mexico have begun adapting their agricultural practices due to climate change, by, for example, delaying crop plantings and planting a diversity of landrace varieties<ref name=\":9\" />. Another strategy focuses on the development and promotion of new, [[Genetically modified plant|transgenic]], \u201cclimate-adapted\u201d seed varieties that have traits for drought- and disease-resistance<ref name=\":9\" />. Researchers have also noted the importance of state leadership in addressing climate change by, for example, training and preparing farmers for climate adaptation<ref name=\":9\" />.

Ecological Responses to Climate Change ==\n\n=== Changes in cloud forest distributions as a result of climate change ===\n[[File:Cloud forest world distribution.jpg|thumb|Image depicting global cloud forest distributions.]]\nMountain cloud forests, especially in the [[Michoac\u00e1n]], act as dispersal corridors for many species that travel between habitats.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite

deforestation.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is important because the distribution of these forests is an integral factor of landscape connectivity.<ref name=\":02\" /> As the distribution of these forests changes due to climate effects, landscape connectivity is also affected.<ref name=\":02\" /> An evaluation of this property of connectivity of the mountain cloud forests of Michoac\u00e1n was carried out by researchers in order to determine which areas would best benefit from greater conservation efforts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Impacts on Animals ===\n\n==== Butterflies ====\nWarming temperatures and land-use change are contributing to the movement of butterfly distributions up the [[Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez]] mountain range in [[Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]].<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite

Mexico, however, it is these tropical dry ecosystems that are highly subject to the effects of land-use change and climate change, making small mammals particularly vulnerable.<ref name=\":32\" /> Researchers set up a 19 year study of small mammal populations in the [[Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve]] located in [[Jalisco|Jalisco, Mexico]].<ref name=\":32\" /> This site was chosen by the researchers due to the occurrence of a significant amount of anthropogenic disturbance in the surrounding area.<ref name=\":32\" /> The researchers concluded that functional diversity in this area was lower than expected, and, as such, greater conservation efforts should be encouraged in the region.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n==== Birds ====\nIn order to determine how conservation efforts should be implemented in order to best protect breeding bird communities, a study was conducted by Aaron D.
