Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed mankind to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], etc.). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.<ref name=\"Book\">{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf E.|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-26691-6|edition=2nd}}</ref> The '''history of materials science''' is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth.

The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.\n\n[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]\n\nThe innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE. \n\n==Stone Age==\nThe use of materials begins in the Stone Age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called [[Oldowan]]. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}</ref> Nearing the end of the Stone Age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Bronze Age==\nThe use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and poured into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the materials was to soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}</ref> Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tylecote|first1=R.F|title=History of Metallurgy, Second Edition|publisher=London: Manley Publishing, for the institute of metals}}</ref>\n\n==Iron Age==\n[[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.\n\nIn the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.\n\n==Antiquity==\n[[File:Fachada del Pante\u00f3n de Roma.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]].]]\n\n[[Wood]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[earth]] are some of the materials which formed the structures of the [[Roman Empire]].

It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}</ref>  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-H\u00e9roult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul H\u00e9roult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}</ref>  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.  Around the same time in 1888, [[Carl Josef Bayer]] was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry.  This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina.

The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.

He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140701183714/http://www.matse.psu.edu/about-us/lectures-and-awards/tressler Richard E.

MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [[Penn State University]] and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [[Rustum Roy]] in 1970.  The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973.  As of 2006{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}, MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members.  MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [[American Physical Society]] or the [[IEEE]].  The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [[soft materials]], which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering.\nBecause of the existence of integrative textbooks, [[materials research societies]] and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.<ref>See Cahn (2001) and Hentschel (2011) for further references and detailed analysis.</ref>\n\nIn 1958, President [[Dwight D.

Materials science became a major established discipline following the onset of the [[Silicon Age]] and [[Information Age]], which began with the invention of the [[MOSFET|metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) by [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959. This led to the development of modern [[computers]] and then [[mobile phones]], with the need to make them smaller, faster and more powerful leading to materials science developing smaller and lighter materials capable of dealing with more complex calculations. This in turn enabled computers to be used to solve complex crystallographic calculations and automate crystallography experiments, allowing researchers to design more accurate and powerful techniques. Along with computers and crystallography, the development of [[laser]] technology from 1960 onwards led to the development of [[light-emitting diodes]] (used in [[DVD players]] and [[smartphones]]), [[fibre-optic communication]] (used in global [[telecommunications]]), and [[confocal microscopy]], a key tool in materials science.<ref>{{cite web |title=100 incredible years of physics \u2013 materials science |url=https://beta.iop.org/100-incredible-years-physics-materials-science |website=[[Institute of Physics]] |date=December 2019 |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nMohamed Atalla, at the [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) [[HP Labs|Semiconductor Lab]] in the 1960s, launched a material science investigation program that provided a base technology for [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs), [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] (GaAsP) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) devices.

The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.\n\n[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]\n\nThe innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE. \n\n==Stone Age==\nThe use of materials begins in the Stone Age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called [[Oldowan]]. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}</ref> Nearing the end of the Stone Age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Bronze Age==\nThe use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and poured into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the materials was to soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}</ref> Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tylecote|first1=R.F|title=History of Metallurgy, Second Edition|publisher=London: Manley Publishing, for the institute of metals}}</ref>\n\n==Iron Age==\n[[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.\n\nIn the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China.

It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}</ref>  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-H\u00e9roult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul H\u00e9roult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}</ref>  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.

The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.

In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Advancing Materials Research|last=Psaras|first=Peter A.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35\u201340}}</ref> ARPA offered 4-year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Northwestern University]], eventually granting 9 more contracts.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html|title=A Selected History of DARPA Innovation|last=|first=|date=|website=DARPA|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [[National Science Foundation]] took over the program in 1972<ref name=\":0\" />), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [[United States]]' research and development of materials science.\n\n==Silicon Age==\n{{See|Silicon Age}}\n\nThe field of [[crystallography]], where [[X-rays]] are shone through crystals of a solid material, was founded by [[William Henry Bragg]] and his son [[William Lawrence Bragg]] at the [[Institute of Physics]] during and after [[World War II]]. Materials science became a major established discipline following the onset of the [[Silicon Age]] and [[Information Age]], which began with the invention of the [[MOSFET|metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) by [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959. This led to the development of modern [[computers]] and then [[mobile phones]], with the need to make them smaller, faster and more powerful leading to materials science developing smaller and lighter materials capable of dealing with more complex calculations. This in turn enabled computers to be used to solve complex crystallographic calculations and automate crystallography experiments, allowing researchers to design more accurate and powerful techniques. Along with computers and crystallography, the development of [[laser]] technology from 1960 onwards led to the development of [[light-emitting diodes]] (used in [[DVD players]] and [[smartphones]]), [[fibre-optic communication]] (used in global [[telecommunications]]), and [[confocal microscopy]], a key tool in materials science.<ref>{{cite web |title=100 incredible years of physics \u2013 materials science |url=https://beta.iop.org/100-incredible-years-physics-materials-science |website=[[Institute of Physics]] |date=December 2019 |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nMohamed Atalla, at the [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) [[HP Labs|Semiconductor Lab]] in the 1960s, launched a material science investigation program that provided a base technology for [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs), [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] (GaAsP) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) devices.

In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the [[ Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century.

The majority of villagers were common [[peasant]]s. Paupers were buried with funeral rites, unlike slaves. In a village of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five elite couples.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}} In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement is the [[Criuleni District]].{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}} Chernyakhov cemeteries feature both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head aligned to the north.

These were ranked below the nobility, but above the [[freedmen]] and slaves.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Ulfilas]] explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction.

Today, scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=23}}\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the progenitors of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\"). In [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colonial period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'').{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=67}}\n\nA large amount of literature has been produced on the Goths, with [[Henry Bradley]]'s ''The Goths'' (1888) being the standard English-language text for many decades.

Later, many moved into the Roman Empire, or settled west of the [[Carpathians]] near what is now [[Hungary]].\n\nA people called the ''Gutones''\u2014possibly early Goths\u2014are documented living near the lower [[Vistula River]] in the 1st century, where they are associated with the archaeological [[Wielbark culture]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/><ref name=\"Heather_ODLA\"/> In his book ''[[Getica]]'', the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]] claimed that the Goths originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] more than 1000 years earlier, but his reliability is disputed.<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/> The Wielbark culture expanded southwards towards the [[Black Sea]], where by the late 3rd century it contributed to the formation of the [[Chernyakhov culture]], which is associated with the Goths who were in frequent conflict and contact with the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/>{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}} By the 4th century at the latest, several groups were distinguishable, among whom the [[Thervingi]] and [[Greuthungi]] were the most powerful.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}} During this time, [[Ulfilas]] began the [[Gothic Christianity|conversion]] of Goths to [[Arianism]].{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\nIn the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths were invaded from the east by the [[Huns]]. In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the [[ Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century. Remnants of Gothic communities in the [[Crimea]], known as the [[Crimean Goths]], lingered on for several centuries, although Goths would eventually cease to exist as a distinct people.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}}{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\n==Name==\nThe origin and meaning of the term ''Goths'' is one of the most discussed topics in [[Germanic philology]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} \n\nIn the [[Gothic language]], the Goths were called the *''[[:wiktionary:gut\u00feiuda|Gut-\u00feiuda]]'' \"Gothic people\" (attested as dative singular ''Gut-\u00feiudai'').{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}} Gutthiuda can also mean \"Land of the Gothic people\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The simplex variant of this name, *''Gutans'' (Goth), or possibly *''Gut\u00f4s'', is inferred from a presumed genitive plural form ''gutani'' in the [[Ring of Pietroassa#Inscription|Pietroassa inscription]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}} \n\nThe Gothic name is generally believed to have been first attested by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources in the 1st century AD in the form of ''Gutones'', which was applied to a people who at that time are recorded as living near the lower [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The name ''Gutones'' is certainly recorded by [[Pliny]] in the 1st century AD, and by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} Pliny mentions that the 4th century BC traveler [[Pytheas]] reported a people called the ''Guiones'', while the early 1st century geographer [[Strabo]] mentions a people called the ''Butones'', and the late 1st century historian [[Tacitus]] mentions the ''Gotones''.{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} These names mentioned by Pytheas, Strabo and Tacitus are often equated with the name ''Gutones''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=37-41}} ''Gutones'' may have meant \"young\" Goths or \"great\" Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Ptolemy mentions not only the ''Gutones'', but also a people of [[Scandia]] called ''Goutai/Guti'', who are generally equated with the [[Geats]]/Gauts ({{lang-ang|g\u0113atas}};

[[John of Gothia]], the [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Doros (Crimea)|Doros]], capital of the Crimean Goths, briefly expelled the Khazars from Crimea in the late 8th century, and was subsequently [[canonized]] as an [[List of Eastern Orthodox saints|Eastern Orthodox saint]].{{sfn|Vasiliev|1936|pp=117\u2013135}}\n\nIn the 10th century, the lands of the Crimean Goths were once again raided by the Khazars. As a response, the leaders of the Crimean Goths made an alliance with [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]], who subsequently waged war upon and utterly destroyed the [[Khazar Khaganate]].{{sfn|Vasiliev|1936|pp=117\u2013135}} In the late Middle Ages the Crimean Goths were part of the [[Principality of Theodoro]], which was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the late 15th century. As late as the 18th century a small number of people in Crimea may still have spoken [[Crimean Gothic]].{{sfn|Bennett|1965|p=27}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ancient sources, the Goths are always described as tall and athletic, with [[light skin]], [[blonde]] hair and [[blue eyes]].<ref name=\"Bradley_9\">{{harvnb|Bradley|1888|p=9}} \"The Goths are always described as tall and athletic men, with fair complexions, blue eyes, and yellow hair...\"</ref>{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=6}} Their physical size became a source of contempt among the Romans.{{sfn|Moorhead|Stuttard|2006|p=56}} Procopius notes that the Vandals and Gepids looked similar to the Goths, and on this basis, he suggested that they were all of common origin. Of the Goths, he wrote that \"they all have white bodies and fair hair, and are tall and handsome to look upon.\"<ref name=\"Procopius_III.II\"/>\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2018 examined the mtDNA of 60 individuals buried at the Wielbark cemetery of Kowalewko in the 1st and 2nd centuries. The majority of the individuals carried types of haplogroup H and U, and notably displayed higher frequencies of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5b]] (a typically [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]] lineage) than preceding and succeeding populations in the area. They were found to be most closely related to Iron Age Scandinavian populations and the [[Bell Beaker culture]]. Strong genetic similarities with modern [[Scandinavians]], such as [[Norwegians]] and [[Swedes]], were detected. The males and females of Kowalewko were found to be of significantly different origins, with males displaying closer links to Iron Age Scandinavia and carrying higher amounts of [[steppe ancestry]] and hunter-gatherer ancestry than the females.{{sfn|Stolarek|2018}}\n\nA genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2019 examined the mtDNA of 27 Goths buried at a Wielbark cemetery in [[Mas\u0142om\u0119cz]] from the 2nd to the 4th centuries. They were found to be mostly carriers of haplogroup H and U. The individuals displayed even closer genetic links to Iron Age Scandinavian populations than did those of Kowalewko. Males and females at Mas\u0142om\u0119cz were found to be more closely related to each other than those at Kowalewko. They also carried fewer samples of U5b, and displayed fewer strong genetic links to the steppe populations than earlier Wielbark samples from Kowalewko. The results appeared to support the theory that the Goths originated in southern Scandinavia and expanded southwards through the Wielbark culture towards the [[Black Sea]], where they mixed with local populations and established the Chernyakhov culture.{{sfn|Stolarek|2019}}\n\nA genetic study published in ''Scientific Reports'' in 2019 examined the mtDNA of three Gothic females from the Chernyakhov culture. They carried haplogroup [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)#H1|H1n6]], H1c and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T2g1]] respectively. The genetic makeup of these individuals differed significantly from that of previous populations of the area, being distinguished by showing a higher amount of ancestry from western and northern Europe. The results appeared to confirm the theory that the Chernyakhov culture emerged as a result of a Gothic migration from the north.{{sfn|J\u00e4rve|2019}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Art===\n{{See also|Migration Period art|Pietroasele Treasure|Ring of Pietroassa}}\n[[File:Ostgoten-fibel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|An Ostrogothic eagle-shaped [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]], AD 500, Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg]]\nBefore the invasion of the Huns, the Gothic Chernyakhov culture produced jewelry, vessels, and decorative objects in a style much influenced by Greek and Roman craftsmen.

All other [[East Germanic languages]] are known, if at all, from proper names or [[De conviviis barbaris|short phrases]] that survived in historical accounts, and from loan-words in other languages. Gothic is known primarily from the [[Codex Argenteus]], a translation of the Bible.{{sfn|Pronk-Tiethoff|2013|pp=9-11}} The language was in decline by the mid-500s, due to the military victory of the Franks, the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation. In Spain the language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589.{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=119\u2013121}} The language survived as a domestic language in the Iberian peninsula (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as late as the 8th century, and [[Franks|Frankish]] author [[Walafrid Strabo]] wrote that it was still spoken in the lower [[Danube]] area in the early 9th century.{{sfn|Pronk-Tiethoff|2013|pp=9-11}}\n\nIn pockets of the Crimea, a related dialect known as [[Crimean Gothic]] survived up until the early modern period, and the 4th-century Bible translation was in use there until at least the 9th century.<ref name=\"Nemalevich\">{{cite web |url=https://meduza.io/feature/2015/12/25/molitvy-na-kamnyah |url-access= |title=\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u044f\u0445 |last1=Nemalevich |first1=Sergey |author-link1= |date=December 25, 2015 |orig-year= |editor-last1= |editor-first1= |editor1= |editor-link1= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor2-link= |editors= |department= |website=[[Meduza]] |series= |publisher= |agency= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title= |type= |format= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn= |jstor= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status= |access-date=September 17, 2019 |via= |quote= |ref=harv |subscription= |registration=}}</ref>\n\n===Society===\n{{See|Palace of Omurtag}}\nArchaeological evidence in Visigothic cemeteries shows that social stratification was analogous to that of the village of [[Sabbas the Goth]]. The majority of villagers were common [[peasant]]s. Paupers were buried with funeral rites, unlike slaves. In a village of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five elite couples.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}} In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement is the [[Criuleni District]].{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}} Chernyakhov cemeteries feature both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head aligned to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools, but hardly ever weapons.{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}}\n\nPeter Heather suggests that the freemen constituted the core of Gothic society. These were ranked below the nobility, but above the [[freedmen]] and slaves.

They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Ulfilas]] explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction.

By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\").

Tyvek is often used as [[housewrap]], a synthetic material used to protect buildings during construction or as personal protective equipment against viruses such as [[SARS-CovD-2]]. The material is difficult to tear, but can easily be cut with [[scissor]]s or a knife. [[Water vapor]] can pass through Tyvek, but liquid water cannot. All of these properties have led to Tyvek being used in a variety of applications.\n\n==History==\nTyvek is a [[Nonwoven fabric|nonwoven]] product consisting of spun bond [[olefin fiber]]. It was first discovered in 1955 by a researcher for the DuPont [[textile]] company working in an experimental lab, who noticed a type of white fluff coming out of a pipe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek.html|title=Tyvek\u00ae brand - For Greater Good\u2122|author=admin|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207232132/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/products/about_pgs/history.html|archivedate=2007-12-07}}</ref> That fluff was a form of [[polyethylene]], which DuPont requested a patent for within a year of the discovery. After technologies improved during the next few years, in 1959 DuPont discovered that when the fluff was spun at high speeds it produced a durable fabric that was able to be cut with a blade. While the product Tyvek was used since 1959, DuPont did not trademark the actual brand until 1965, making it available for  commercial purposes in April 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/products-and-services/fabrics-fibers-nonwovens/protective-fabrics/brands/tyvek/tyvek-media-center.html|title=DuPont\u2122 Tyvek\u00ae Marks 40 Years of Energy Efficiency and Protection|publisher=[[DuPont]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122333/http://www2.dupont.com/Tyvek/en_US/news_events/article20070619.html|archivedate=2008-02-09}}</ref>  As of 1970, Tyvek had reached the mainstream construction industry on both a national and global scale, and is often used for the construction of houses due to its ability to keep out liquid, while allowing vapor through.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Building_Innovations/en_CN/knowledgeCenter/kc_tyvekhistory.html|title=History of Weather Barrier|website=www2.dupont.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> In 1972, DuPont released Tyvek packaging for sterile instruments that were to be used by surgeons and doctors in the medical field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dupont.com/content/dam/dupont/products-and-services/packaging-materials-and-solutions/medical-and-pharmaceutical-packaging-materials/documents/MPP_Introduction_to_DuPont_Tyvek.pdf|website=www.dupont.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2017, the DuPont company merged with another chemical company, [[Dow Chemical Company|The Dow Chemical Company]] to form [[DowDuPont]].
