The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her. She eventually is killed in an act of heroism in book three, \"The Third Day, The Frost\", where she blows herself up in order to kill Major Harvey once and for all.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative. ''[[The Age]]'' proclaimed the series \"the best series for Australian teens of all time...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomorrow-series.eu/en/books/07-the-other-side-of-dawn|title=The Tomorrow Series \u2013 Your source for everything about John Marsden's series, Tomorrow, When the War Began and the upcoming Tomorrow movies.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help. In addition, a group called \"Liberation\", headed by the mysterious \"Scarlet Pimple\" (a play of words on \"[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]\"), are conducting secret border raids against the new nation.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film===\n{{Main|Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)}}\nIn June 2009, [[Screen Australia]] announced that it would fund the development of the feature film ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'', written and directed by screenwriter [[Stuart Beattie]] (''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]], [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), and produced by Andrew Mason for Ambience Entertainment, reportedly to begin production in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|title=John Marsden book to be made into film|work=[[Nine News]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912012709/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |title=Stuart Beattie looks to 'Tomorrow' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619081417/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=screenaustralia>{{Cite news|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|title=Screen Australia announces funding for five features including ''Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos'' and ''Tomorrow When the War Began''|work=[[Screen Australia]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028193357/http://screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Raymond Terrace]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], was chosen as a major location for producing the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|title=Terrace on centre stage|work=Port Stephens Examiner|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115504/http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|archive-date=13 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was released in Australian cinemas on 2 September 2010.

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help. In addition, a group called \"Liberation\", headed by the mysterious \"Scarlet Pimple\" (a play of words on \"[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]\"), are conducting secret border raids against the new nation.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film===\n{{Main|Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)}}\nIn June 2009, [[Screen Australia]] announced that it would fund the development of the feature film ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'', written and directed by screenwriter [[Stuart Beattie]] (''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]], [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), and produced by Andrew Mason for Ambience Entertainment, reportedly to begin production in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|title=John Marsden book to be made into film|work=[[Nine News]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912012709/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |title=Stuart Beattie looks to 'Tomorrow' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619081417/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=screenaustralia>{{Cite news|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|title=Screen Australia announces funding for five features including ''Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos'' and ''Tomorrow When the War Began''|work=[[Screen Australia]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028193357/http://screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Raymond Terrace]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], was chosen as a major location for producing the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|title=Terrace on centre stage|work=Port Stephens Examiner|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115504/http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|archive-date=13 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was released in Australian cinemas on 2 September 2010.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it.

Traditionally, two meals were eaten per day, breakfast (''{{lang|ain|kunneywa ipe}}'') and dinner (''{{lang|ain|onuman ipe}}''), and a third meal, lunch (''{{lang|ain|tokes ipe}}''), was added during the [[Taisho period]]. A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|416}}\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}} Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|412}}\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"ainuminzokushi1970\"/>{{rp|406-420}}<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u6b74\u53f294\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "name_user": "Erynamrod", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePrimary dishes:corrected spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_cuisine"}

The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The ''Albina'' Bank), as did the [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|ASTRA]] (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian's People Culture). After the [[Romanian Orthodox]] Church was granted status in the [[Austrian Empire]] from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan seat]], and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Between the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and 1867 (the year of the ''[[Ausgleich]]''), Sibiu was the meeting-place of the [[Transylvanian Diet]], which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] was dissolved, Sibiu became part of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnic German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community, as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until after 1990, most of the city's ethnic Germans emigrated to [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Among the roughly 2,000 who have remained is [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]], the {{As of|2014|alt=current}} [[President of Romania]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sibiu_Centru_vedere_panoramica.jpg|Panoramic view of Sibiu from 1928\nFile:Sibiu vedere de pe Deaulul Gusteritei.jpg|View from Gu\u0219teri\u021ba hill\nFile:Johann B\u00f6bel - Poarta Burger-Ocnei, la 1857.jpg|Burger-Ocnei gate\nFile:Johann Bobel - Turnul Portii Cisnadiei.jpg|Cisn\u0103die's Gate Tower\nFile:Johann B\u00f6bel - Strada Turnului \u015fi biserica Evanghelic\u0103.jpg|Tower's Street and the Evangelical Lutheran Church\nFile:Hermanstatt (Sibiu), 17th century engraving.jpg|Copper engraving of Sibiu (''Hermanstatt''), {{circa}} 1630.\nFile:Lanzedelli - T\u00e2rg \u00een Transilvania 4.jpg|A busy market scene in Sibiu, 1818\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Sibiu region.png|thumb|Topographic map of the Sibiu region]]\n\n[[File:Sibiu-pictures-001.jpg|alt=|thumb|]]\n\nSibiu is situated near the geographical center of Romania at {{Coord|45.792784|N|24.152069|E|region:RO_type:city}}. Set in the Cibin Depression, the city is about 20&nbsp;km from the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]], 12&nbsp;km from the [[Cibin Mountains]], and about 15&nbsp;km from the [[Lotru Mountains]], which border the depression in its southwestern section. The northern and eastern limits of Sibiu are formed by the T\u00e2rnavelor Plateau, which descends to the Cibin Valley through Gu\u0219teri\u021bei Hill.\n \nThe Cibin river as well as some smaller streams runs through Sibiu. The geographical position of Sibiu makes it one of the most important transportation hubs in Romania with important roads and railway lines passing through it.\n\n===City districts===\nThe following districts are part of Sibiu. Some were villages annexed by the city but most were built as the city developed and increased its surface.\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*Historic Center \u2013 Divided into the Upper Town and Lower Town\n*Centru (Centre)\n*Lupeni\n*[[Trei Stejari]]\n*[[Vasile Aron (Sibiu district)|Vasile Aaron]]\n*[[Hipodrom (Sibiu district)|Hipodrom I, II, III, IV]]\n*[[Valea Aurie]] (Golden Valley)\n*Tili\u0219ca\n*[[\u0218trand]]\n*[[Turni\u0219or]] (Little Tower; {{lang-de|Neppendorf}})\n*Pia\u021ba Cluj\n*[[\u021aiglari]]\n*[[Terezian (Sibiu district)|Terezian]]\n*Re\u0219i\u021ba\n*[[Lazaret (Sibiu district)|Lazaret]]\n*[[Gu\u0219teri\u021ba]] ({{lang-de|Hammersdorf}})\n*[[Brosc\u0103rie]]\n*Viile Sibiului\n*Tineretului\n*Veteranilor de R\u0103zboi\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe Southern part, including the [[ASTRA National Museum Complex]] and the Zoo, also falls within the city limits.\n\n== Climate ==\nSibiu's climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] with average temperatures of {{convert|8|to|9|C|F}}.

Also, here you can find the Zoological Garden and Ethnography Museum.\n\nThere is a [[Sibiu Steam Locomotives Museum|Steam Locomotives Museum]] close to the railway station, sheltering around 40 [[steam locomotive|locomotives]], two of which are functional.\n\nThe first park in the city was The Promenade, later called \"The Disabled Promenade.\" established in 1791, today part of Parcul Cet\u0103\u021bii (Citadel Park). Current arrangement of the park, including the space between the walls, dates from 1928.\n\nThe Sub Arini Park, established between 1857 and 1859 based on plans of military engineer Michael Seyfried,<ref>[https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/14902-eine-graefin-mit-herz.html]</ref> is one of the biggest and best-maintained parks in Romania.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s.

Also planned is a Museum of the Culture and Civilisation of the Romany People.[[File:Sibiu-park-bicycle.jpg|thumb|Bicycle riders in Sub Arini park, in Sibiu.]]\n\nThe [[Dumbrava Sibiului Natural Park]] stretches over 960 hectares and it is situated 4&nbsp;km away from the center of the city in the southwest direction along the road towards R\u0103\u015finari. Also, here you can find the Zoological Garden and Ethnography Museum.\n\nThere is a [[Sibiu Steam Locomotives Museum|Steam Locomotives Museum]] close to the railway station, sheltering around 40 [[steam locomotive|locomotives]], two of which are functional.\n\nThe first park in the city was The Promenade, later called \"The Disabled Promenade.\" established in 1791, today part of Parcul Cet\u0103\u021bii (Citadel Park). Current arrangement of the park, including the space between the walls, dates from 1928.\n\nThe Sub Arini Park, established between 1857 and 1859 based on plans of military engineer Michael Seyfried,<ref>[https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/14902-eine-graefin-mit-herz.html]</ref> is one of the biggest and best-maintained parks in Romania.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s. Two of these survived to this day, as the ''Haller Bastion'' (all the way down Coposu Boulevard) and \"Soldisch Bastion\".\n\n'''The Passage of the Stairs''',\nleads down to the lower section of Sibiu. It descends along some fortifications under the support arches. It is one of several passages linking the two sides of the old city.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Spitalul Judetean Sibiu.jpg|thumb|Sibiu County Hospital]]\nSibiu is one of the important medical centers of Romania, housing many important medical facilities:\n* County Hospital\n* Academic Emergency Hospital;\n* Hospital of Pediatrics;\n* Military Emergency Hospital;\n* CFR Hospital (Romanian Railways Hospital);\n* \"Dr. Gheorghe Preda\" Psychiatry Hospital\n* other smaller private clinics\n\nThe city also houses one of the largest private hospitals in the country, Polisano.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal High School]]\n\nSibiu is an important centre of higher education, with over 23,000 students in four public and private higher institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|title=:: L B U S :: About LBUS|first=Departamentul de Comunica\u0163ii \u0219i Marketing al|last=ULBS|website=www.ulbsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404104637/http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 Land Forces Military Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130124204/http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 |date=2015-01-30 }} at mediafax.ro</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|title=Universitatea Romano-Germana din Sibiu|website=www.roger-univ.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173051/http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|archivedate=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|title=Istoricul Universitatii Alma Mater Sibiu \u2013 Universitatea Alma Mater Sibiu|website=www.uamsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504160830/http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|archivedate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]] was founded in 1990, with five faculties: Engineering and Sciences; Language Sciences; History and Law; Medicine; Food and Textile Processing Technology.

It was a quiet farming region when about that time a [[New York City]] contractor named Van Aken bought up all the local farms and set out to develop a city. He had the farms laid out into lots, some streets put through and named after the style of New York. He donated land for the railroad station that had a dining room underneath (the station was torn down in February, 1940).  There is an abandoned train station in Belle Mead. When Van Aken went broke, the property was sold to a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]], [[John R.

It was a quiet farming region when about that time a [[New York City]] contractor named Van Aken bought up all the local farms and set out to develop a city. He had the farms laid out into lots, some streets put through and named after the style of New York. He donated land for the railroad station that had a dining room underneath (the station was torn down in February, 1940).  There is an abandoned train station in Belle Mead. When Van Aken went broke, the property was sold to a [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]], [[John R.

His father owned a hotel. He grew up in [[Gmunden]] on the [[Traunsee]] in [[Upper Austria]]. His first language was French and his second German.\n\nIn 1904, his father left his wife and Ludwig\u2019s [[governess]], both of whom were pregnant with his child, for another woman,<ref name=\"The New York Times 2018\" /> after which his mother took Ludwig and his brother to her native city of [[Regensburg]], Germany. Bemelmans had difficulty in school, as he hated the German style of discipline. He was [[apprentice]]d to his uncle Hans Bemelmans at a hotel in Austria. In a 1941 ''New York Times'' interview with Robert van Gelder, he related that while an apprentice, he was regularly beaten and even whipped by the headwaiter. According to Bemelmans, he finally warned the headwaiter that if he was whipped again he would retaliate with a gun. The headwaiter ignored his warning, whipped him, and Bemelmans reportedly shot and seriously wounded him in retaliation.<ref name=\"The New York Times 2018\">{{cite web | title=How the Author of 'Madeline' Created His Most Famous Character | website=The New York Times | date=27 April 2018 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/style/madeleine-author-illustrator.html | access-date=3 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=van Gelder|first=Robert|date=January 26, 1941|title=An Interview with Ludwig Bemelmans|url=|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Given the choice between reform school and emigration to the United States, he chose the latter.<ref name=roberts/> It is likely this was one of Bemelman\u2019s famous yarns, since in John Bemelmans Marciano\u2019s biography of his grandfather, he relates a simpler story: recognizing that Ludwig was an incorrigible boy, his uncle offered him the choice of going to America (where his father now lived), or going to reform school.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bemelmans: The Life and Art of Madeline's Creator|last=Marciano|first=John Bemelmans|publisher=Viking|year=1999|isbn=0-670-88460-X|location=New York, NY|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780670884605}}</ref><br /><!-- supports two preceding sentences except does not locate hotel (calls Hans owner); see TALK#Austrian -->\n\n==In America==\nHe spent the next several years working at hotels and restaurants in the US.

As he describes in his autobiographical ''My Life in Art'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life in Art|last=Bemelmans|first=Ludwig|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref> he had avoided oil painting because it did not permit him to produce artistic pieces quickly. But at this point in his life, he wanted to master the richness of oil painting. To this end, he set out to buy a property in Paris that would serve as a serious, full-blown art studio. In 1953, he fell in love with a small [[bistro]] in Paris, {{ill|La Colombe (cabaret)|lt=La Colombe|fr}} in the ''[[Ile de la Cit\u00e9]]'', and bought it, intending to convert it into a studio. He painted [[mural]]s therein, but the project was a disaster owing to French bureaucracy, and after two years of frustration and disappointment, he unloaded it by selling it to [[Michel Valette]], who converted it into a notable [[cabaret]].\n\nBemelmans also wrote a number of adult books, including travel, humorous works and novels, as well as movie scripts. The latter included ''[[Yolanda and the Thief]]''. While spending time in [[Hollywood]], he became a close friend of interior decorator [[Elsie de Wolfe|Elsie de Wolfe, Lady Mendl]].\n\nA mural on the walls of the [[Carlyle Hotel]]'s Bemelmans Bar in New York City, ''Central Park'', is his only artwork on display to the public. He painted the children's dining room on [[Aristotle Onassis]]'s yacht ''Christina'' (now the ''[[Christina O]]''), for the young daughter of the magnate, [[Christina Onassis]].\n\n===Madeline series===\nEach Madeline story begins: \"In an old house in Paris, that was covered with vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines... the smallest one was Madeline.\" The girls are cared for by Miss Clavel. She is likely a nun, as some French orders called themselves Madames, particularly that of St. [[Madeleine Sophie Barat]],<ref>[http://sofie.org/resources/founding-mothers/madeleine-sophie-barat St. Madeleine Sophie Barat], founder of the order</ref> after which this convent school seems to be modeled; and \"Mrs.\" would not be an appropriate equivalent in English. Some have argued that Miss Clavel's apparel looks more like that of a nurse (although why a nurse is working in what appears to be a Paris convent school is not explained).\n\nOther characters include Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador, who lives next door; Lord Cucuface, owner of the house; and Genevieve, a dog who rescues Madeline from [[drowning]] in the second book. Bemelmans published six Madeline stories in his lifetime, five as picture books and one in a magazine. A seventh was discovered after his death and published posthumously:\n\n#''[[Madeline (book)|Madeline]]'', 1939: in which Madeline must have her appendix removed\n#''[[Madeline's Rescue]]'', 1953: in which Madeline is rescued from drowning by a dog (later named Genevieve).

His father owned a hotel. He grew up in [[Gmunden]] on the [[Traunsee]] in [[Upper Austria]]. His first language was French and his second German.\n\nIn 1904, his father left his wife and Ludwig\u2019s [[governess]], both of whom were pregnant with his child, for another woman,<ref name=\"The New York Times 2018\" /> after which his mother took Ludwig and his brother to her native city of [[Regensburg]], Germany. Bemelmans had difficulty in school, as he hated the German style of discipline. He was [[apprentice]]d to his uncle Hans Bemelmans at a hotel in Austria. In a 1941 ''New York Times'' interview with Robert van Gelder, he related that while an apprentice, he was regularly beaten and even whipped by the headwaiter. According to Bemelmans, he finally warned the headwaiter that if he was whipped again he would retaliate with a gun. The headwaiter ignored his warning, whipped him, and Bemelmans reportedly shot and seriously wounded him in retaliation.<ref name=\"The New York Times 2018\">{{cite web | title=How the Author of 'Madeline' Created His Most Famous Character | website=The New York Times | date=27 April 2018 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/style/madeleine-author-illustrator.html | access-date=3 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=van Gelder|first=Robert|date=January 26, 1941|title=An Interview with Ludwig Bemelmans|url=|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Given the choice between reform school and emigration to the United States, he chose the latter.<ref name=roberts/> It is likely this was one of Bemelman\u2019s famous yarns, since in John Bemelmans Marciano\u2019s biography of his grandfather, he relates a simpler story: recognizing that Ludwig was an incorrigible boy, his uncle offered him the choice of going to America (where his father now lived), or going to reform school.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bemelmans: The Life and Art of Madeline's Creator|last=Marciano|first=John Bemelmans|publisher=Viking|year=1999|isbn=0-670-88460-X|location=New York, NY|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780670884605}}</ref>\n\n<br /><!-- supports two preceding sentences except does not locate hotel (calls Hans owner); see TALK#Austrian -->\n\n==In America==\nHe spent the next several years working at hotels and restaurants in the US.

Bemelmans did not write a second Madeline book until 1953, when he published ''Madeline\u2019s Rescue''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Madeline's Rescue|last=Bemelmans|first=Ludwig|publisher=Viking|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Four more books in the series were subsequently published while he was alive, and one more was published posthumously in 1999. \n\nUp until the early 1950s, the artistic media he worked in were pen and ink, water color, and gouache. As he describes in his autobiographical ''My Life in Art'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life in Art|last=Bemelmans|first=Ludwig|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref> he had avoided oil painting because it did not permit him to produce artistic pieces quickly. But at this point in his life, he wanted to master the richness of oil painting. To this end, he set out to buy a property in Paris that would serve as a serious, full-blown art studio. In 1953, he fell in love with a small [[bistro]] in Paris, {{ill|La Colombe (cabaret)|lt=La Colombe|fr}} in the ''[[Ile de la Cit\u00e9]]'', and bought it, intending to convert it into a studio. He painted [[mural]]s therein, but the project was a disaster owing to French bureaucracy, and after two years of frustration and disappointment, he unloaded it by selling it to [[Michel Valette]], who converted it into a notable [[cabaret]].\n\nBemelmans also wrote a number of adult books, including travel, humorous works and novels, as well as movie scripts. The latter included ''[[Yolanda and the Thief]]''. While spending time in [[Hollywood]], he became a close friend of interior decorator [[Elsie de Wolfe|Elsie de Wolfe, Lady Mendl]].\n\nA mural on the walls of the [[Carlyle Hotel]]'s Bemelmans Bar in New York City, ''Central Park'', is his only artwork on display to the public. He painted the children's dining room on [[Aristotle Onassis]]'s yacht ''Christina'' (now the ''[[Christina O]]''), for the young daughter of the magnate, [[Christina Onassis]].\n\n===Madeline series===\nEach Madeline story begins: \"In an old house in Paris, that was covered with vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines... the smallest one was Madeline.\" The girls are cared for by Miss Clavel. She is likely a nun, as some French orders called themselves Madames, particularly that of St. [[Madeleine Sophie Barat]],<ref>[http://sofie.org/resources/founding-mothers/madeleine-sophie-barat St. Madeleine Sophie Barat], founder of the order</ref> after which this convent school seems to be modeled; and \"Mrs.\" would not be an appropriate equivalent in English. Some have argued that Miss Clavel's apparel looks more like that of a nurse (although why a nurse is working in what appears to be a Paris convent school is not explained).\n\nOther characters include Pepito, son of the Spanish ambassador, who lives next door; Lord Cucuface, owner of the house; and Genevieve, a dog who rescues Madeline from [[drowning]] in the second book. Bemelmans published six Madeline stories in his lifetime, five as picture books and one in a magazine. A seventh was discovered after his death and published posthumously:\n\n#''[[Madeline (book)|Madeline]]'', 1939: in which Madeline must have her appendix removed\n#''[[Madeline's Rescue]]'', 1953: in which Madeline is rescued from drowning by a dog (later named Genevieve). Winner of the [[Caldecott Medal]] for U.S. [[picture book]] illustration\n#''[[Madeline and the Bad Hat]]'', 1956: in which the \"bad hat\" is Pepito, the Spanish ambassador's son, whose cruel antics outrage Madeline.\n#''[[Madeline and the Gypsies]]'', 1959: in which Madeline and Pepito have an adventure at a circus.\n#''[[Madeline in London]]'', 1961: in which Pepito moves to London, and Madeline and the girls go to visit him.\n#''[[Madeline's Christmas]]'', 1985: in which everyone in the house catches cold, except Madeline.
