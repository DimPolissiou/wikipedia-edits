It was recorded primarily in Starr's home studio in [[Los Angeles]] and was released on 15 September 2017 by [[Universal Music Enterprises|UM{{sup|e}}]]. The album features Starr's frequent collaborators such as [[Joe Walsh]], [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], [[Gary Nicholson (singer)|Gary Nicholson]] and [[Bob Malone]], members of his [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]], and guest appearances by Starr's former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] bandmate [[Paul McCartney]].<ref name=\"Variety 070717\">{{cite web|title=Ringo Starr Reveals New Album Details, Celebrates 77th Birthday With David Lynch, Joe Walsh, Jenny Lewis|author=Steve Marinucci|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=7 July 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017|url=https://variety.com/2017/music/news/ringo-starr-new-album-birthday-peace-love-capitol-records-tower-1202489752/}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nStarr began working on the album following the release of ''[[Postcards from Paradise]]'' and a tour with his [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]]. Starr initially recruited longtime collaborator [[David A. Stewart]] to help him produce a [[Country music|country]] album in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], but ultimately ended up recording mostly rock tracks in his home studio.<ref name=\"Variety 070717\" /> The album features a number of Starr's regular collaborators, including former and current All-Starr band members [[Steve Lukather]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Edgar Winter]] and [[Timothy B. Schmit]].\n\nStarr's former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] bandmate [[Paul McCartney]] plays bass on two tracks and sings backing vocals. Starr announced McCartney's appearance on the album via [[Twitter]].<ref>#RingoStarr. \"Thanks for Coming over Man and Playing Great Bass.

Web. 8 July 2017.</ref>\n\nThe album consists of ten new original tracks and four bonus tracks; the bonus tracks are all re-recordings of songs previously released by Starr. The re-recording of Starr's 1972 single \"[[Back Off Boogaloo]]\" is based on Starr's original demo of the song and features [[Electric Light Orchestra]] founder [[Jeff Lynne]] and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] member [[Joe Walsh]] on guitar. The re-recording of \"You Can't Fight Lightning\" from ''[[Stop and Smell the Roses]]'' features the Swedish band [[Alberta Cross]], and the re-recordings of Starr's song \"[[Photograph (Ringo Starr song)|Photograph]]\" and his Beatles song \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\" feature the American band [[Vandaveer]].\n\nStarr officially announced the album on 7 July 2017, his 77th birthday, and simultaneously released the title track as a single via streaming services and digital download. \"We're on the Road Again\", featuring McCartney, Lukather, Walsh and Winter, was released as a second single on 18 July. The country track \"So Wrong for So Long\" was released as a single on 18 August.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7905167/ringo-starr-so-wrong-for-so-long-premiere|title=Ringo Starr Shares Country-Tinged 'So Wrong For So Long' From New Album: Exclusive|publisher=billboard.com|date=2017-08-17|accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref> \"Standing Still\" was released as the final single on 8 September.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ringostarr.com/news/ringostarrcom-exclusive-standing-still-give-more-love|title=RINGOSTARR.COM EXCLUSIVE: \"STANDING STILL\" FROM 'GIVE MORE LOVE'|publisher=ringostarr.com|accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>\n\n== Release and reception==\n\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 55/100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/give-more-love/ringo-starr/critic-reviews<!--|title=Bot generated title -->|website=metacritic.com}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|3|5|}}<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/give-more-love-mw0003081079|title=Give More Love \u2013 Ringo Starr \u2013 Songs, Reviews, Credits \u2013 AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|3|5|}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/review-ringo-starrs-give-more-love-w503111|title=Review: Ringo Starr Brings Rock & Roll Optimism, Just When We Need It|website=rollingstone.com}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Times]]''\n| rev3score = {{Rating|2|5|}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pop-review-ringo-starr-give-more-love-m7nj7cqdw|title=Pop review: Ringo Starr: Give More Love|first=Will|last=Hodgkinson|date=15 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Express & Star]]''\n| rev4score = 7/10<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/2017/09/14/album-review-ringo-starr---give-more-love/|title=Album Review: Ringo Starr \u2013 Give More Love|first=Leigh|last=Sanders|website=www.expressandstar.com}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n''Give More Love'' received mixed reviews upon its release.

{"title_page": "Vizing's theorem", "text_new": "In [[graph theory]], '''Vizing's theorem''' states that every simple [[undirected graph]] may be [[edge coloring|edge colored]] using a number of colors that is at most one larger than the maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{math|\u0394}} of the graph.\nAt least {{math|\u0394}} colors are always necessary, so the undirected graphs may be partitioned into two classes: \"class one\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394}} colors suffice, and \"class two\" graphs for which {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors are necessary.\nA more generalized version of Vizing's theorem states that every undirected [[multigraph]] without loops can be colored with at most {{math|\u0394+\u00b5}} colors, where {{math|\u00b5}} is the multiplicity of the multigraph.\nThe theorem is named for [[Vadim G. Vizing]] who published it in 1964.\n\n==Examples==\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 1}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must itself be a matching, with no two edges adjacent, and its edge chromatic number is one. That is, all graphs with {{math|1=\u0394(''G'') = 1}} are of class one.\n\nWhen {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}}, the graph {{mvar|G}} must be a [[disjoint union]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] and [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]]. If all cycles are even, they can be 2-edge-colored by alternating the two colors around each cycle. However, if there exists at least one odd cycle, then no 2-edge-coloring is possible. That is, a graph with {{math|1=\u0394 = 2}} is of class one if and only if it is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]].\n\n==Proof==\nThis proof is inspired by {{harvtxt|Diestel|2000}}.\n\nLet {{math|1=''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''V'',&nbsp;''E'')}} be a simple undirected graph. We proceed by induction on {{math|''m''}}, the number of edges. If the graph is empty, the theorem trivially holds. Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''. It was renamed ''Metody Diskretnogo Analiza'' in 1980 (the name given for it in {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}}) and discontinued in 1991 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=DISKA].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brooks' theorem]] relating vertex colorings to maximum degree\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Appel | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kenneth Appel\n | last2 = Haken | first2 = W. | author2-link = Wolfgang Haken\n | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14122-5\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0424602\n | pages = 711\u2013712\n | title = Every planar map is four colorable\n | volume = 82\n | year = 1976}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Diestel | first1=Reinhard | title=Graph Theory | pages=103\u2013104| url=http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/pdffiles/DiestelGT.pdf | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | year=2000 }}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Erd\u0151s | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Erd\u0151s\n | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Robin J.\n | year = 1977\n | title = Note on the chromatic index of almost all graphs\n | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | series = Series B\n | volume = 23\n | pages = 255\u2013257\n | url = http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1977-20.pdf\n | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(77)90039-9\n | issue = 2\u20133}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Fournier | first = Jean-Claude\n | journal = Cahiers du Centre d'\u00c9tudes de Recherche Op\u00e9rationnelle\n | mr = 0349458\n | pages = 311\u2013314\n | title = Colorations des ar\u00eates d'un graphe\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1973}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Frieze | first1 = Alan M. | author1-link = Alan M.

Let {{math|''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0}} and suppose a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists for all {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} where {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}}.\n\nWe say that color {{math|&alpha;&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;{1,...,\u0394+1}}} is missing in {{math|''x''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''V''}} with respect to proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring {{math|''c''}} if {{math|''c''(''xy'')&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;&alpha;}} for all {{math|''y''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;N(''x'')}}. Also, let {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''x''}} denote the unique maximal path starting in {{math|''x''}} with {{math|&alpha;}}-colored edge and alternating the colors of edges (the second edge has color {{math|&beta;}}, the third edge has color {{math|&alpha;}} and so on), its length can be {{math|0}}. Note that if {{math|''c''}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} then every vertex has a missing color with respect to {{math|''c''}}.\n\nSuppose that no proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} exists. This is equivalent to this statement:\n:(1) Let {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''}} be arbitrary proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|&beta;}} be missing from {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''c''}}. Then the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''}} ends in {{math|''x''}}.\n\nThis is equivalent, because if (1) doesn't hold, then we can interchange the colors {{math|&alpha;}} and {{math|&beta;}} on the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path and set the color of {{math|''xy''}} to be {{math|&alpha;}}, thus creating a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''}} from {{math|''c''}}. The other way around, if a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring exists, then we can delete an edge, restrict the coloring and (1) won't hold either.\n\nNow, let {{math|''xy''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''E''}} and {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} be a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|&alpha;}} be missing in {{math|''x''}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}. We define {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} to be a maximal sequence of neighbours of {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nWe define coloring {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} as\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''</sub>){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''j''+1</sub>)}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''i''}},\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} not defined,\n:{{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e''){{=}}''c''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}} otherwise.\n\nThen {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a proper {{math|(\u0394+1)}}-edge-coloring of {{math|''G''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>}} due to definition of {{math|''y''<sub>0</sub>,...,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Also, note that the missing colors in {{math|''x''}} are the same with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}.\n\nLet {{math|&beta;}} be the color missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>}}, then {{math|&beta;}} is also missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{math|0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''}}. Note that {{math|&beta;}} cannot be missing in {{math|''x''}}, otherwise we could easily extend {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, therefore an edge with color {{math|&beta;}} is incident to {{math|''x''}} for all {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}. From the maximality of {{math|''k''}}, there exists {{math|1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''}} such that {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}. From the definition of {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}} this holds: \n:{{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;''c''<sub>''k''</sub>(''xy''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>)&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;&beta;}}\n\nLet {{math|''P''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. From (1), {{math|''P''}} has to end in {{math|''x''}}. But {{math|&alpha;}} is missing in {{math|''x''}}, so it has to end with an edge of color {{math|&beta;}}. Therefore, the last edge of {{math|''P''}} is {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>''x''}}. Now, let {{math|''P' ''}} be the {{math|&alpha;/&beta;}}-path from {{math|''y''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''c''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub>}}. Since {{math|''P' ''}} is uniquely determined and the inner edges of {{math|''P''}} are not changed in {{math|''c''<sub>0</sub>,...,''c''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, the path {{math|''P' ''}} uses the same edges as {{math|''P''}} in reverse order and visits {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. The edge leading to {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}} clearly has color {{math|&alpha;}}. But {{math|&beta;}} is missing in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, so {{math|''P' ''}} ends in {{math|''y''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. Which is a contradiction with (1) above.\n\n==Classification of graphs==\nSeveral authors have provided additional conditions that classify some graphs as being of class one or class two, but do not provide a complete classification. For instance, if the vertices of the maximum degree {{math|\u0394}} in a graph {{mvar|G}} form an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], or more generally if the [[induced subgraph]] for this set of vertices is a forest, then {{mvar|G}} must be of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fournier|1973}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Erd\u0151s|Wilson|1977}} showed that [[almost all]] graphs are of class one. That is, in the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model]] of random graphs, in which all {{mvar|n}}-vertex graphs are equally likely, let {{math|''p''(''n'')}} be the probability that an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph drawn from this distribution is of class one; then {{math|''p''(''n'')}} approaches one in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity. For more precise bounds on the rate at which {{math|''p''(''n'')}} converges to one, see {{harvtxt|Frieze|Jackson|McDiarmid|Reed|1988}}.\n\n==Planar graphs==\n{{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} showed that a [[planar graph]] is of class one if its maximum degree is at least eight.\nIn contrast, he observed that for any maximum degree in the range from two to five, there exist\nplanar graphs of class two.  For degree two, any odd cycle is such a graph, and for degree three, four, and five, these graphs can be constructed from [[platonic solid]]s by replacing a single edge by a path of two adjacent edges.\n\nIn '''Vizing's planar graph conjecture''', {{harvtxt|Vizing|1965}} states that all simple, planar graphs with maximum degree six or seven are of class one, closing the remaining possible cases.\n{{harvtxt|Sanders|Zhao|2001}} partially proved Vizing's planar graph conjecture by showing that all planar graphs with maximum degree seven are of class one.\nThus, the only case of the conjecture that remains unsolved is that of maximum degree six. This conjecture has implications for the [[Total coloring|total coloring conjecture]].\n\nThe planar graphs of class two constructed by subdivision of the platonic solids are not regular: they have vertices of degree two as well as vertices of higher degree.\nThe [[four color theorem]] (proved by {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1976}}) on vertex coloring of planar graphs, is equivalent to the statement that every bridgeless 3-regular planar graph is of class one {{harv|Tait|1880}}.\n\n==Graphs on nonplanar surfaces==\nIn 1969, [[Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum]] conjectured that every 3-regular graph with a polyhedral embedding on any two-dimensional [[oriented manifold]] such as a [[torus]] must be of class one. In this context, a polyhedral embedding is a [[graph embedding]] such that every face of the embedding is topologically a disk and such that the [[dual graph]] of the embedding is simple, with no self-loops or multiple adjacencies. If true, this would be a generalization of the four color theorem, which was shown by Tait to be equivalent to the statement that  3-regular graphs with a polyhedral embedding on a [[sphere]] are of class one. However, {{harvtxt|Kochol|2009}} showed the conjecture to be false by finding [[Snark (graph theory)|snarks]] that have polyhedral embeddings on high-genus orientable surfaces. Based on this construction, he also showed that it is NP-complete to tell whether a polyhedrally embedded graph is of class one.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kochol|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\n{{harvtxt|Misra|Gries|1992}} describe a polynomial time algorithm for coloring the edges of any graph with {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors, where {{math|\u0394}} is the maximum degree of the graph. That is, the algorithm uses the optimal number of colors for graphs of class two, and uses at most one more color than necessary for all graphs. Their algorithm follows the same strategy as Vizing's original proof of his theorem: it starts with an uncolored graph, and then repeatedly finds a way of recoloring the graph in order to increase the number of colored edges by one.\n\nMore specifically, suppose that {{math|''uv''}} is an uncolored edge in a partially colored graph. The algorithm of Misra and Gries may be interpreted as constructing a directed [[pseudoforest]] {{mvar|P}} (a graph in which each vertex has at most one outgoing edge) on the neighbors of {{mvar|u}}: for each neighbor {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|u}}, the algorithm finds a color {{mvar|c}} that is not used by any of the edges incident to {{mvar|p}}, finds the vertex {{mvar|q}} (if it exists) for which edge {{mvar|uq}} has color {{mvar|c}}, and adds {{mvar|pq}} as an edge to {{mvar|P}}. There are two cases:\n*If the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} constructed in this way contains a path from {{mvar|v}} to a vertex {{mvar|w}} that has no outgoing edges in {{mvar|P}}, then there is a color {{mvar|c}} that is available both at {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|w}}. Recoloring edge {{mvar|uw}} with color {{mvar|c}} allows the remaining edge colors to be shifted one step along this path: for each vertex {{mvar|p}} in the path, edge {{mvar|up}} takes the color that was previously used by the successor of {{mvar|p}} in the path. This leads to a new coloring that includes edge {{mvar|uv}}.\n*If, on the other hand, the path starting from {{mvar|v}} in the pseudoforest {{mvar|P}} leads to a cycle, let {{mvar|w}} be the neighbor of {{mvar|u}} at which the path joins the cycle, let {{mvar|c}} be the color of edge {{mvar|uw}}, and let {{mvar|d}} be a color that is not used by any of the edges at vertex {{mvar|u}}. Then swapping colors {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d}} on a [[Kempe chain]] either breaks the cycle or the edge on which the path joins the cycle, leading to the previous case.\nWith some simple data structures to keep track of the colors that are used and available at each vertex, the construction of {{mvar|P}} and the recoloring steps of the algorithm can all be implemented in time {{math|O(''n'')}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of vertices in the input graph. Since these steps need to be repeated {{mvar|m}} times, with each repetition increasing the number of colored edges by one, the total time is {{math|O(''mn'')}}.\n\nIn an unpublished technical report, {{harvtxt|Gabow|Nishizeki|Kariv|Leven|1985}} claimed a faster <math>O(m\\sqrt n\\log n)</math> time bound for the same problem of coloring with  {{math|\u0394 + 1}} colors.\n\n==History==\nIn both {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Soifer|2008}}, Vizing mentions that his work was motivated by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Shannon|1949}} showing that multigraphs could be colored with at most {{math|(3/2)\u0394}} colors. Although Vizing's theorem is now standard material in many graph theory textbooks, Vizing had trouble publishing the result initially, and his paper on it appears in an obscure journal, ''Diskret. Analiz''.<ref>The full name of this journal was ''Akademiya Nauk SSSR. Sibirskoe Otdelenie. Institut Matematiki. Diskretny\u02d8\u0131 Analiz. Sbornik Trudov''. It was renamed ''Metody Diskretnogo Analiza'' in 1980 (the name given for it in {{harvtxt|Gutin|Toft|2000}}) and discontinued in 1991 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/journaldoc.html?jc=DISKA].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brooks' theorem]] relating vertex colorings to maximum degree\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Appel | first1 = K. | author1-link = Kenneth Appel\n | last2 = Haken | first2 = W. | author2-link = Wolfgang Haken\n | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1976-14122-5\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n | mr = 0424602\n | pages = 711\u2013712\n | title = Every planar map is four colorable\n | volume = 82\n | year = 1976}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Diestel | first1=Reinhard | title=Graph Theory | pages=103\u2013104| url=http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/pdffiles/DiestelGT.pdf | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin, New York | year=2000 }}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Erd\u0151s | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Erd\u0151s\n | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Robin J.\n | year = 1977\n | title = Note on the chromatic index of almost all graphs\n | journal = [[Journal of Combinatorial Theory]] | series = Series B\n | volume = 23\n | pages = 255\u2013257\n | url = http://www.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1977-20.pdf\n | doi = 10.1016/0095-8956(77)90039-9\n | issue = 2\u20133}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Fournier | first = Jean-Claude\n | journal = Cahiers du Centre d'\u00c9tudes de Recherche Op\u00e9rationnelle\n | mr = 0349458\n | pages = 311\u2013314\n | title = Colorations des ar\u00eates d'un graphe\n | volume = 15\n | year = 1973}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Frieze | first1 = Alan M. | author1-link = Alan M.
