During the British era, the effects of the western architecture were only seen in the growing centres of the country and gradually urbanised these areas like Suva and Levuka. In the contemporary times, there exists numerous building that are built in British architectural style or the Victorian style.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.safaritheglobe.com/fiji/culture/architecture/|title=Architecture of Fiji|website=www.safaritheglobe.com|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> These structures are visible in growing Fiji cities in the form of Churches, houses and offices, mostly in the areas of Suva. For example, the Borron House, Veivueti House (Draiba), Cable and Wireless Office, Victoria Parade, Suva City Library, Victoria Parade and Nasova House, Levuka.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://fijimuseum.org.fj/historical-buildings-sites/|title=Historical Buildings & Sites|website=Fiji Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> Moreover, many of the colonial building that remain in Suva that are still being used today are turned into heritage sites. Buildings like the Vineyard, that used to be the old Town Hall and the FINTEL building that once housed the Pacific Cable and Wireless Office, are archaeologically important and have been conserved and protected under various Acts and Regulations <ref name=\":6\" />\n\nWhile on one hand colonialization brought in the Western influences on the architecture, on-the other hand it also brought people from other nations in the form of plantation labourers like the Indians. The Indians brought with them a new style of architecture to the country, most particularly in the form of Hindu temples and Islamic Mosques. These spiritual and religious structures are usually established in areas dominated by the Indian diaspora, chiefly in the urban regions of the island.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe impact of the colonial culture in Fiji can be observed from the architectural patterns in numerous office buildings including the [[Government House, Suva|Nasova House]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chatan|first=Robbin|date=2003|title=The Governor's vale levu: Architecture and Hybridity at Nasova House, Levuka, Fiji Islands|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=267\u2013292|doi=10.1023/B:IJHA.0000014313.12737.d6|issn=1092-7697}}</ref>  The Nasova House or the Governors vale levu is the best example of the impact of colonial culture on architecture, it is the hybridization of the colonial ideologies and the native culture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chatan|first=Robbin|date=2003|title=The Governor's \"vale levu\": Architecture and Hybridity at Nasova House, Levuka, Fiji Islands|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|volume=7|issue=4|pages=267\u2013292|issn=1092-7697|jstor=20853036|doi=10.1023/B:IJHA.0000014313.12737.d6}}</ref> Still now, the colonial architectural patterns are used and implemented in designing diverse sorts of buildings.\n\n== Architectural schools ==\n\n=== Local style ===\nThe  local style of the architecture in Fiji is reflected in the materials used in them and the design of the layouts. The use of palm wood, reed wood, and the village layout patterns contribute to the distinct Urban architectural style of Fiji.<ref name=\":4\"/> While the rural community of the country id highly hierarchical, the local style architecture is also based on hierarchy. Houses as mentioned above, are called Bures or Vales, these vales are rectangular cabins made of wood and dried palm leaves and have no windows and only one door. The length and size of the door also depends on the class and level of the man in the society, who owns the house.<ref name=\":0\" /> The local architecture is usually constructed with communal collectives and the knowledge and training of this architectural style is passed down from one generation to another.<ref name=\":4\" /> Moreover, the local style are changing with coming of modernisation and the influence of Christianity in the region.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, due to the impact by the colonial powers and the emergence of globalisation, the local style has been mixed with foreign styles.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Z\u00e1molyi|first=Ferenc|chapter=Architecture of Fiji|date=2016|pages=471\u2013499|editor-last=Selin|editor-first=Helaine|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7747-7_10215|isbn=9789400777460|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures}}</ref>\n\n=== Foreign style ===\nArchitectural style in Fiji has been influenced by [[Western culture|foreign or western styles]] since the nineteenth century, mainly due to the [[Colony of Fiji|colonial era]]. The rise of globalisation and the amalgamation of different cultural values both from western and non-western lands enhanced the architecture. The Laucala Island which was brought by Australian Plantation company in the eighteenth century and later bought by New Yorker Malcolm Forbes in 1972, is an excellent example of the foreign architecture that came into existence on the island. The Forbes house built on the island of Laucala is an idyllic British cottage. Moreover, the house has high beam ceilings and glass windows. However, the interiors of the house are inspired by Fijian art and aesthetics.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/fiji-island-once-owned-by-malcolm-forbes|title=A Look Back at Laucala, the Dreamy Fiji Island Once Owned by Malcolm Forbes|last=Nast|first=Cond\u00e9|website=Architectural Digest|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> Additionally, the Forbes estate is built in a style that captures the western and the Fijian culture and architecture in true beauty, with thatched roof of beach shacks looking towards the ocean and in house pool to facilitate relaxation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn the current period, the architecture of Fiji utilizes [[modern technology]], tools, and materials to enhance the aesthetic effectiveness of the built environments.<ref name=\"Fisher 2000\">{{Cite thesis|title=The socio-economic consequences of tourism in Levuka, Fiji|url=https://researcharchive.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/1284|publisher=Lincoln University|date=2000|degree=Thesis|language=en|first=David F.|last=Fisher}}</ref> The design of the [https://www.kokomoislandfiji.com/discover/design/ Kokomo Private Island] in Fiji is a perfect example of such amalgamation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centurion-magazine.com/travel/private-islands/fiji-kokomo-island|title=Kokomo Private Island, Fiji|website=Centurion Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> The foreign influence is more visible in the [[Urban area|urban landscapes]] as compared with the [[rural area]]s.\n\n== Implications in the World ==\nThe architecture in Fiji is a potent example of the perfect balance between locale styles and foreign styles.

However, scholars like Mitsuko, Noriko and Masamitsu have associated the culture of Fiji to incorporate the traditional architecture with western ideas as an influence of Japan.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n<references responsive=\"0\" />{{Navbox\n| state      = \n| name       = nav box\n| title      = Architecture of Fiji\n| image             = [[File:Islands far away; Fijian pictures with pen and brush (1921) (14591146757).jpg|thumb|Islands far away; Fijian pictures with pen and brush (1921) (14591146757)]]\n| above      = \n| abovestyle = \n| listclass  =\n| group1     = Resort Hotel/Villa \n| list1      =\n| group2     =  Residential Buildings\n| list2      = \n* [[Sri Siva Subramaniya Temple]]\n* [[Holy Trinity Church]]\n| group3     = Office Buildings\n| group4     = Architectural Schools\n}}\n\n{{uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHeritage(link changed toCultural heritage) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_architecture_of_Fiji"}
