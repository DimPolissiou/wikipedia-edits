First realizations include today's houses at 5/7/11 P\u0142ocka street.\n\n===1926-1936 Bydgoszcz development program<ref name=\"KB26\"/>===\nBogdan Raczkowski devised a grand urbanization project for the city, intending to support private construction initiatives and identifying specific areas to be developped. In addition to ''Sielanka'' and ''Skrzetusko'' districts, he focused his attention to streets Czarna Droga, Dwernickiego, [[Gimnazjalna, Libelta and Szwalbego streets in Bydgoszcz|Libelta]], Niemcewicza and Piotrowskiego. \n[[File:Bdg Szwederowo 1 06-2014.jpg|thumb|View of ''Szwederowo'' district]]\nHis idea was to assign districts purposes:\n* residential for  ''[[:pl:Bielawy (Bydgoszcz)|Bielawy]]'', ''[[:pl:Skrzetusko|Skrzetusko]]'', ''[[:pl:Szwederowo|Szwederowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Bielice (Bydgoszcz)|Bielice]]'', ''[[:pl:Wilczak (Bydgoszcz)|Wilczak]]'' and ''[[:pl:Okole (Bydgoszcz)|Okole]]'';\n* worker's dwellings for ''[[:pl:Miedzy\u0144|Miedzy\u0144]]'' and ''[[:pl:Jachcice|Jachcice]]''; \n* factories at ''[[:pl:Kapu\u015bciska|Kapu\u015bciska]]'', ''[[:pl:Zimne Wody (Bydgoszcz)|Zimne Wody]]'', ''[[:pl:\u0141\u0119gnowo|\u0141\u0119gnowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Siernieczek|Siernieczek]]''.\n\nThe last chapter of this extensive project was aiming at planning the urbanization of ''[[:pl:Osiedle Le\u015bne (Bydgoszcz)|Le\u015bny]]'' district, so as to become a showcase of Bydgoszcz for people entering the city from the north. With that ambition, in October 1933, the architect divided the {{convert|30|ha|m2}} area into 9 plots. This project was completed only on the eastern side of [[Gda\u0144ska Street in Bydgoszcz|Gda\u0144ska Street]], as the Ministry of Military Affairs did not allowed the development on the western part.\n\n==Works in [[Bromberg|Bydgoszcz]]==\nBogdan Raczkowski's education at the faculty of [[Lviv]] gave him the taste for new trends in architecture. At a time when [[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|neoclassicism]] was declining, technical and industrial progress opened up building potentials, with state-of-the-art materials ([[steel]] and [[glass]]) and innovative methods. In addition to the following realizations, Raczkowski also conceived habitations at Babia Wie\u015b (1926-1927), at 22-38 \u017bwirki i Wigury street (1930) and prepared in the early 1920s a project -never carried out- for the [[St. Vincent de Paul Basilica Minor in Bydgoszcz|basilica of St. Vincent de Paul in Bydgoszcz]].\n\n===Building at 13 Piotrowskiego, 1923-1925===\nThis tenement displays classical shapes on a 4-storey fa\u00e7ade, topped by [[rosette (design)|rosette]]s. \n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:13 Piotrowskiego, Bydgoszcz.jpg|Tenement at 13, Piotrowskiego\n</gallery>\n\n===[[:pl:Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

On her side, Maria was active in Bydgoszcz branch of the [[Polish Red Cross|Polish White Cross]], the social movement created in February 1918 by [[Helena Paderewska]], second wife of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]. <ref>The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] did not allow the use of its name for Poland since as the country did not officially exist</ref>\n\nFleeing the Nazi invasion, the Raczkowski's left Bydgoszcz and moved to Marie's family estate in [[Kutno]] in September for one month.\nWhen they came back, their [[Kopernika_Street_in_Bydgoszcz#House_at_1_Asnyka_street%2C_corner_with_Kopernika_street|house]] at 1, Asnyka street was occupied by a German officer: hence they moved to live at a cousin's flat, Stefan Je\u017cowski, on [[Adam Mickiewicz Alley in Bydgoszcz|Weyssenhoff Square]].\n[[Nazi Germany|Nazi authorities]] arranged for them to pick up few of their belonging from their former house on October 2, in the afternoon: when Bogdan and his daughter went to collect their belongings, they found the villa surrounded by the [[Gestapo]]. Both of them, together with Maria were arrested and shot on October 4, 1939, in the forest, north of Bydgoszcz ({{lang-pl|Las Gda\u0144ski}}). Only their son Zdzis\u0142aw escaped the round up, as he stayed with friends at that time. He quickly left Bydgoszcz and hid for the entire period of the war under the name of Zbigniew Ko\u017amian.<ref name=\"KB87\"/>\nTo make matter worse, Tadeusz, Bogdan's brother, was executed at the [[Valley of Death (Bydgoszcz)|Valley of Death]] in late October 1939.\n\nBogdan Raczkowski also painted pictures: landscapes of places he visited ([[Zakopane]], [[Ciechocinek]], [[Hel Peninsula|Hel]], [[Or\u0142owo, Inowroc\u0142aw County|Or\u0142owo]], [[Kharkiv]], Rostov, [[Sevastopol]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]]). From 1931 onward, he had been a board member of the Society of Friends of Fine Arts in Bydgoszcz.\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1921, Bogdan supported an urban development plan in the area delimited by streets Mo\u015bcicki (now Sportowa), Chopina and Moniuszki. \nHis family lived in one of the houses of the project, located at 3 Moniuszki street.<ref>{{cite book |last=S.

Tom 4 |pages=72-85}}</ref>\nAt the same time, Raczkowski prepared an expansion project to give an area further north (''Skrzetusko'') an homogeneous character (sector defined by streets P\u0142ocka, Chodkiewicza, Su\u0142kowskiego and Kozietulskiego). First realizations include today's houses at 5/7/11 P\u0142ocka street.\n\n===1926-1936 Bydgoszcz development program<ref name=\"KB26\"/>===\nBogdan Raczkowski devised a grand urbanization project for the city, intending to support private construction initiatives and identifying specific areas to be developped. In addition to ''Sielanka'' and ''Skrzetusko'' districts, he focused his attention to streets Czarna Droga, Dwernickiego, [[Gimnazjalna, Libelta and Szwalbego streets in Bydgoszcz|Libelta]], Niemcewicza and Piotrowskiego. \n[[File:Bdg Szwederowo 1 06-2014.jpg|thumb|View of ''Szwederowo'' district]]\nHis idea was to assign districts purposes:\n* residential for  ''[[:pl:Bielawy (Bydgoszcz)|Bielawy]]'', ''[[:pl:Skrzetusko|Skrzetusko]]'', ''[[:pl:Szwederowo|Szwederowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Bielice (Bydgoszcz)|Bielice]]'', ''[[:pl:Wilczak (Bydgoszcz)|Wilczak]]'' and ''[[:pl:Okole (Bydgoszcz)|Okole]]'';\n* worker's dwellings for ''[[:pl:Miedzy\u0144|Miedzy\u0144]]'' and ''[[:pl:Jachcice|Jachcice]]''; \n* factories at ''[[:pl:Kapu\u015bciska|Kapu\u015bciska]]'', ''[[:pl:Zimne Wody (Bydgoszcz)|Zimne Wody]]'', ''[[:pl:\u0141\u0119gnowo|\u0141\u0119gnowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Siernieczek|Siernieczek]]''.\n\nThe last chapter of this extensive project was aiming at planning the urbanization of ''[[:pl:Osiedle Le\u015bne (Bydgoszcz)|Le\u015bny]]'' district, so as to become a showcase of Bydgoszcz for people entering the city from the north. With that ambition, in October 1933, the architect divided the {{convert|30|ha|m2}} area into 9 plots. This project was completed only on the eastern side of [[Gda\u0144ska Street in Bydgoszcz|Gda\u0144ska Street]], as the Ministry of Military Affairs did not allowed the development on the western part.\n\n==Works in [[Bromberg|Bydgoszcz]]==\nBogdan Raczkowski's education at the faculty of [[Lviv]] gave him the taste for new trends in architecture. At a time when [[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|neoclassicism]] was declining, technical and industrial progress opened up building potentials, with state-of-the-art materials ([[steel]] and [[glass]]) and innovative methods. In addition to the following realizations, Raczkowski also conceived habitations at Babia Wie\u015b (1926-1927), at 22-38 \u017bwirki i Wigury street (1930) and prepared in the early 1920s a project -never carried out- for the [[St. Vincent de Paul Basilica Minor in Bydgoszcz|basilica of St. Vincent de Paul in Bydgoszcz]].\n\n===Building at 13 Piotrowskiego, 1923-1925===\nThis tenement displays classical shapes on a 4-storey fa\u00e7ade, topped by [[rosette (design)|rosette]]s. \n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:13 Piotrowskiego, Bydgoszcz.jpg|Tenement at 13, Piotrowskiego\n</gallery>\n\n===[[:pl:Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

The album peaked at number 23 in the UK, selling a total of 101,986 copies, and achieved Silver certification. Internationally, the album also charted in the Netherlands, Sweden and France. The album spawned two singles, \"AM to PM\" and \"[[When You Look at Me]]\", which charted worldwide.\n\n== Production and composition ==\nFollowing her collaboration with Ja Rule, Milian signed a deal with [[Island Def Jam Music Group]] in 2000.<ref name=\"peopmil\">{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1032818,00.html |title=Celeb Spotlight: Christina Milian |author=Kappes, Serena |date= March 2, 2005 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Milian traveled to Sweden and recorded her self-titled debut album,<ref name=\"releasemilian\"/> working with the popular producers of that time.<ref name=\"milianinterviewsongs\"/> Milian collaborated with [[Bloodshy & Avant]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Bernard \"Focus...\" Edwards, Jr.|Focus]], [[Irv Gotti]], [[Artful Dodger (UK band)|Mark Hill]], [[Montell Jordan]] and [[Evan Rogers]].<ref name=\"allmusicmili\"/> Soren Baker of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later suggested that instead of launching her career off the success of \"Between Me and You\", and by recording in Sweden without the \"platinum production touch\" of Irv Gotti, the owner of [[The Inc.

Her label still opted to release it in Europe, but the album was never released in North America.<ref name=\"milianbiog2\"/>\n\nMilian made her first professional musical appearance on [[Ja Rule]]'s single \"[[Between Me and You]]\", which led to a record deal with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Soul]] and [[The Inc. Records]] in 2000. Milian traveled to Sweden where she collaborated with several producers, most notably [[Bloodshy & Avant]], who helmed five tracks. Milian co-wrote eleven of the twelve songs on the album, taking inspiration from personal experiences. The album's musical style is mostly [[dance music|dance]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and critics noted similarities to her contemporaries [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]. Milian was displeased by Def Soul's portrayal of her image, which she felt was constantly changing and confusing the audience.\n\nThe critical response to ''Christina Milian'' was mixed; critics who gave a positive review enjoyed the catchy tracks and lead single \"[[AM to PM]]\", while others found that it lacked original ideas. The album peaked at number 23 in the UK, selling a total of 101,986 copies, and achieved Silver certification. Internationally, the album also charted in the Netherlands, Sweden and France. The album spawned two singles, \"AM to PM\" and \"[[When You Look at Me]]\", which charted worldwide.\n\n== Production and composition ==\nFollowing her collaboration with Ja Rule, Milian signed a deal with [[Island Def Jam Music Group]] in 2000.<ref name=\"peopmil\">{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1032818,00.html |title=Celeb Spotlight: Christina Milian |author=Kappes, Serena |date= March 2, 2005 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref> Milian traveled to Sweden and recorded her self-titled debut album,<ref name=\"releasemilian\"/> working with the popular producers of that time.<ref name=\"milianinterviewsongs\"/> Milian collaborated with [[Bloodshy & Avant]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Bernard \"Focus...\" Edwards, Jr.|Focus]], [[Irv Gotti]], [[Artful Dodger (UK band)|Mark Hill]], [[Montell Jordan]] and [[Evan Rogers]].<ref name=\"allmusicmili\"/> Soren Baker of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later suggested that instead of launching her career off the success of \"Between Me and You\", and by recording in Sweden without the \"platinum production touch\" of Irv Gotti, the owner of [[The Inc.

He was created in 1964 by writer [[Bob Haney]] and artist [[Ramona Fradon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=201}}</ref> \n\nMetamorpho is a founding member of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and has also joined multiple incarnations of the [[Justice League]]. The character has been moderately popular since his introduction in 1965. Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved.\n\n==Publication history==\nMetamorpho's creator, [[Bob Haney]], had seen success with DC Comics in 1963 with the titles ''[[Metal Men]]'' and ''[[Doom Patrol]]'', featuring bands of superheroes exhibiting fantastic powers. Under the editorial management of [[George Kashdan]], Haney was asked to capitalize on these titles' popularity with a similar character. Metamorpho, the Element Man, debuted in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #57 (January 1965).<ref>{{cite book| last= McAvennie |first= Michael| editor-last= Dolan| editor-first= Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle| publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 114 |quote = Scribe Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon were truly in their element...Haney and Fradon's collaborative chemistry resulted in [Rex] Mason becoming Metamorpho.}}</ref>\n\nAs first conceived, Metamorpho was a parody of the fantastic characters that populated comic books in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jones | first=Gerard |author2=Will Jacobs | title=The Comic Book Heroes | location=[[Rocklin, California]] | publisher=Prima Lifestyles | pages=76\u201377 | date=October 23, 1996 | isbn=978-0-7615-0393-4}}</ref> Artist [[Ramona Fradon]] was coaxed out of maternity retirement to illustrate Metamorpho's first appearances. The popularity of Metamorpho's appearances in ''The Brave and the Bold'' led to a 17-issue [[ongoing series]] between 1965 and 1968. Metamorpho also appeared during this time in two issues of ''Justice League of America'' (#42 and #44) and became the second superhero to decline an invitation to join that organization ([[Adam Strange]] being the first), though he did become a reservist, eventually being called in during a Justice League/Justice Society crossover to help find and rescue the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nMetamorpho appears on the cover of ''Aquaman'' #30 as one of the pallbearers (along with Batman, Hawkman, and Superman) at the \"Sea King's Funeral\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/aquaman-30-the-death-of-aquaman/4000-108970/ |title=Aquaman #30 - The Death of Aquaman |website=Comic Vine |access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> Metamorpho also appears in a series of backup stories in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #413\u2013418 and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #218\u2013220 and #229.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Stroud|first = Bryan|title = Metamorpho in ''Action Comics'' |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue = 64 |pages = 22\u201327| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date = May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Metamorpho appeared in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #3, a brief anthology series consisting of one-shots. That issue was written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Ramona Fradon, Metamorpho's creators. Haney and Fradon had met at the 1974 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], and while reminiscing, it emerged that both of them regarded Metamorpho as one of the features they'd most enjoyed working on, leading them to ask DC if they could do one more Metamorpho story together.<ref name=\"back71\">{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz |first= Jack| title= 1st Issue Special: It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant To Be)| journal= [[Back Issue!]]| issue=71 |page= 42| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date= April 2014 |location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Fradon later commented, \"I think we both felt that Metamorpho was our baby. I never had an experience like I had working with Bob Haney on ''Metamorpho''. It was like our minds were in perfect synch ... it was one of those wonderful collaborations that doesn't happen very often.\"<ref name=\"back71\"/>\n\nAfter becoming a charter member of the Outsiders in 1983, and member of the European branch of the [[Justice League International]], Metamorpho received his own four-issue mini-series in 1993.\n\nIn 2005, DC Comics reprinted Metamorpho's early ''The Brave and the Bold'' appearances and the entirety of the 1965 series as one of the company's volumes of ''[[Showcase Presents]]''.\n\nIn 2007, [[Dan Jurgens]] launched the six-issue series ''Metamorpho: Year One''.\n\nAs part of a ''[[Wednesday Comics]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]] wrote a 12-page Metamorpho story that [[Mike Allred]] illustrated.<ref>{{cite web | first= Remy | last= Minnick | url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19775 | title=Gaiman & Allred on Metamorpho | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 30, 2009 | accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref> In 2016 he starred in a new comic book series titled DC's ''Legends of Tomorrow''.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/articles/aaron-lopresti-talks-metamorpho-in-new-dcs-legends/1100-155102/ |title= Aaron Lopresti Talks Metamorpho in New DC's LEGENDS OF TOMORROW Series|work=Comic Vine |access-date= 2018-09-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nRex Mason is an adventurer who is hired by [[Stagg Enterprises]] CEO, [[Simon Stagg]], to retrieve a rare [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, the [[Orb of Ra]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/metamor.htm |title=Metamorpho the Element Man}}</ref> Shortly after hiring him, Simon Stagg learns that Mason has been dating his daughter, [[Sapphire Stagg]]. This and other incidents begin to fuel in Stagg a dislike for Mason that ultimately leads to a plot to kill him.\n\nIn an [[Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid]], Rex Mason is knocked unconscious by Simon's brutish bodyguard [[Java (comics)|Java]] and is eventually exposed to a radioactive [[meteoroid|meteor]]ite from which the Orb of [[Ra]] was fashioned. A tremendous flare-up of its radiation transforms Mason into Metamorpho, the Element Man. He gains the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and change himself into any [[chemical element|element]] or combination of elements found in the human body. It is also established in his origin story in ''[[The Brave & The Bold]]'' #57 that Metamorpho is virtually invulnerable in his inert (untransformed) state, when Stagg, afraid that Rex is going to kill him, shoots him point-blank without effect. The Orb of Ra, however, has the same effect on Rex that [[kryptonite]] has on [[Superman]]. Thus Stagg continues to control Metamorpho using the Orb. Later, it is revealed that Mason is but one of many [[metamorphae]]. They were created by the sun god Ra, using the meteorite, to serve as warriors in his battle against the god [[Apep]], \"the serpent who never dies.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | last1=Beatty | first1=Scott | authorlink1=Scott Beatty | last2=Jimenez | first2=Phil | authorlink2=Phil Jimenez | date=October 4, 2004 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Limited | isbn=978-0-7566-0592-6 | page=202}}</ref>\n\nMetamorpho, unlike most super-humanoids described in DC Comics, cannot assume a normal, fully human appearance, being no longer composed of flesh, blood and bone. As such, he regards his metamorphic powers as a disease and seeks a cure for his condition. Because he considers himself a freak and wishes only to be restored to his former human state, he rejects an offer of membership from the [[Justice League of America]] in ''JLA'' #42. [[Green Lantern]] attempts to change him back using his power ring, but due to a \"yellow\" component of the meteorite radiation, is unable to make him normal again.\n\nMetamorpho briefly has a crimefighting partner named Urania \"Rainie\" Blackwell, a woman who deliberately exposed herself to the Orb to gain its powers. She calls herself [[Element Girl]] (nicknamed \"the Chemical Doll\") and works with him on a number of cases.\n\nIssues #16\u201317 were intended to show a new direction for the series, with Sapphire marrying a man named Wally Bannister and Metamorpho joining a mysterious Mr. Shadow to deal with an immortal queen. Bent on world conquest, the queen (an exact lookalike of Sapphire) marries Metamorpho. She later steps outside her mystic city and instantly ages 2,000 years. When Wally Bannister is murdered by Algon (a metamorph who has lived for centuries in a depowered state), Metamorpho is [[frame-up|framed]]. Instead of coming to his defense against the false accusations, Metamorpho's colleague Mr. Shadow comes forth as an enemy. It is revealed that Mr. Shadow was attempting to enslave Metamorpho all along. Metamorpho is tried and convicted by a jury of rabble and is then executed by [[absolute zero]]; the first of what will become a series of multiple if temporary deaths.\n\nElement Girl revives Metamorpho, and Algon, the real murderer, is killed by molten lava minerals in an attempt to regain his burned-out powers. It is later learned that Mr. Bannister's murder was actually engineered by the villainous Prosecutor, who is then killed by an [[insectoid]] villain in a cocoon. At this point, issue #17 ends, and the story is never continued.\n\nMetamorpho reappears years later in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #101 (April\u2013May 1972). It is revealed that Metamorpho had spent the period after the end of his own series immersed in a painful chemical bath concocted by Stagg in an attempt to cure his condition. Stagg retrieves him from this \"cure\" too early because he needs Mason to save his endangered daughter Sapphire. Metamorpho stars in a new backup series beginning in ''Action'' #413 (June 1972). There is no reference in this revival series to the events or characters of his previous two issues.\n\nUrania Blackwell, unreferenced since the end of the regular series, is later revealed to have ended her partnership with Metamopho when her unrequited attraction to him became too much for her. Blackwell's powers are removed at her own request by Ra, resulting in her death; the episode, in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]],'' involves [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]]. Death mentions Algon's death in passing, trying to convince Blackwell that she will not live forever.\n\n===Outsiders===\nMetamorpho spends some time working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. While in the [[despotism|despotically]] ruled nation Mozombia, Metamorpho is subdued and dissassembled. The tyrant's forces keep him inert with a constant application of radiation. He is freed by [[Katana (comics)|Katana's]] indestructible sword, which had been latched onto a live electrical wire. While leaving Mozombia, the Outsiders' plane is shot down by the [[Bad Samaritan]]. Metamorpho and the others spend some time stranded on a deserted island, simply too far away from land to rescue themselves.\n\nMetamorpho perishes for the second time during the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event.<ref name= outsiders27>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Mike W. Barr|Barr, Mike W.]] | artist=[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]] | story= Robot Tyrants of Kadeyland! | title=The Outsiders | volume=1 | issue=27 | date=January 1988 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Doctor Jace, the scientific adviser to the Outsiders, has decided that life with the more logical [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] is preferable and she betrays the team; they fight back, but Metamorpho has been brainwashed into assisting Jace. He is killed in the resulting battle.<ref name=outsiders27/> He is again revived during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' miniseries, when a gene-bomb set off by invading aliens affects his biomass.\n\n===Justice League===\nMetamorpho spends some time with the Justice League, including [[Justice League Europe]]. During this period he encounters Sapphire Stagg again. He becomes involved in a battle with the [[Metal Men]], who have been tricked by Simon Stagg. His League friends, [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]] and [[Animal Man]], are at the site of the battle, but are being detained by Java. At the conclusion of the battle, Metamorpho learns he had a son with Sapphire. Unfortunately, the baby boy's touch harms all but Sapphire and Metamorpho. When Java holds the baby, his arms melt. Metamorpho hands the baby over to Simon, who immediately fears he will be affected like Java was moments before and die. However, something in his genetic structure protects him, just as it did with Sasphire. Simon's stance softens and everyone is set free. [[Will Magnus|Doc Magnus]], the leader of the Metal Men, offers his services in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho's friends are puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he hoped the baby would kill Simon.\n\nLater, Metamorpho has a romantic relationship with [[Crimson Fox]], which is cut short by her apparent murder. His personal investigation of the incident uncovers multiple layers of lies and deceit. During his time with the team, while fighting the planet-smashing aliens called The Family, Metamorpho is hit by a powerful energy blast that destroys his body. He quickly re-forms in a totally different look. He will sport this new look until his next demise.\n\n===Second death===\nLater, the [[Hyperclan]] attacked the Justice League of America's [[Justice League Watchtower|orbiting base]], destroying it. Metamorpho protected three of his teammates, [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], and the original [[Icemaiden]], in a giant, fluid filled ball. The intent was for them to survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The three make it, injured but alive, but Metamorpho does not. He was buried with solemn honors. After a temporary resurrection by the wish-granting [[The Cathexis|Id]] (fundamentally flawed because the wisher, his son Joey, only wished for him to be ''back'' rather than to be ''alive''), he would return some time later.\n\n===Return===\nSapphire Stagg used the Orb of Ra to bring Metamorpho back to life, and he briefly joined the [[Doom Patrol]]. Shortly thereafter, an accident with one of Simon Stagg's experiments turned Simon, Sapphire, and Joey into an energy being, and caused Metamorpho to take on the form and personality of Java. \"Java\" kidnapped [[Black Canary]], asking for her help in rescuing the others. With Canary's help, he became Metamorpho again and managed to return the others to their normal forms.<ref>''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #51\u201352 (March\u2013April 2003)</ref>\n\n===Outsiders / \"Shift\"===\nAt the same time, Metamorpho had seemingly been appearing in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) series, but Rex Mason informed the team that their \"Metamorpho\" is a regrown fragment of his own body.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #7 (February 2004)</ref> Rex attempts to reassimilate his \"twin\", but the Outsiders convinced him that the twin deserves the chance to lead his own life. This second Metamorpho chose the name \"Shift\" and developed a relationship with [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]], becoming depressed over her death. After the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', Shift willingly chose to be reassimilated into Metamorpho, because he had killed several people. Rex has stepped in to fill Shift's position in the Outsiders, while a full account of Shift's crimes is explained in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) Annual; he had inadvertently killed 44 people during [[Black Lightning]]'s escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]].\n\nMetamorpho continued to serve on the Outsiders when [[Batman]] took over, and following its further restructuring following Batman's apparent death. He was apparently killed alongside the rest of the team in a satellite explosion orchestrated by [[Talia al Ghul]].<ref>''[[Batman Incorporated]]: Leviathan Strikes''</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nOn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, an August 2013 story reveals that the Outsiders are revealed to have survived. It is mentioned that Metamorpho was able to save the team by using the same technique he used to rescue the Justice League during the Hyperclan's attack many years ago.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> He is also shown as one of the candidates for the new [[Justice League International]], but he is ultimately not chosen.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Metamorpho is featured on the news as an example of the \"Superman Theory\" where the government has been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMetamorpho was transmuted into Nth Metal by Simon Stagg as part of his plot to open the portal to the Dark Multiverse. While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho as Plastic Man shields them from the Dark Multiverse energy which he is immune to. Upon arriving on a lifeless world, they encounter Phantom Girl who has been trapped in her intangible form and had no knowledge of sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of Tom Strong who states that they are needed to save the universe.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho learn from Phantom Girl that she was stuck in intangible form since she was a child. After the four of them made it back to their world, Mister Terrific tries to leave the three of them at Simon Stagg's compound only to be drawn back to them.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #2. DC Comics.</ref> Due to the effects of the Dark Multiverse energy, Mister Terrific concludes that they can't go their separate ways due to this bond.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #3.

DC Comics. </ref> She fires back with his physical insecurities, and the situation is unresolved along with Java adding tension.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #5. DC Comics. </ref> Simelatniously, the Terrifics take on fellow Element Man Algon, who wants to turn the world full of element people. In the process of defeating him by using the Orb of Ra, Rex is turned human again.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #6. DC Comics. </ref> After the Terrifics disband post - the reveal that Java was Doctor Dread all along, Rex slowly comes to realize how worthless and boring he is without his heroic duties. On purpose, Rex and Element Dog sneak into Stagg Industries and use the Orb of Ra to turn back into their elemental selves, before rejoining the other heroes in a fight against Doctor Dread's Dreadfuls. After this battle, Rex is made chief security officer at Stagg Industries, and his relationship with Sapphire is repaired.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMetamorpho can transmute his body to any of a wide variety of elemental compounds and form it to his will. Originally, he was limited to the elements which occur naturally in the human body. Over time, this limitation seems to have disappeared. He can alter the shapes and consistencies of these elements and combine them to form complex compounds. Rex can assume forms of gas, liquid or solid states.\n\nMetamorpho can also shape parts and portions of his body instead of the whole. He can form such complex shapes as a tank and a bicycle and such simple forms as a cloud or a spring.\n\nThe nature of Rex's body provides him with natural body armor, offering damage resistance from blunt attacks and energy attacks.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Justice===\nRex Mason/Metamorpho appears in the 12-issue mini-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', as a member of the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice'' #7</ref>\n\n===JLA: The Nail===\nIn the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an unstable Metamorpho is forced to kill the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] by the [[Jimmy Olsen|unknown mastermind]] behind the recent anti-metahuman propaganda. He later attacks [[Lexcorp]] tower in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], but [[J'onn J'onzz]] intercepts the attack, Metamorpho weakly explaining that someone forced him to kill by threatening his family, before he died as a result of their enemy's attempt to brainwash him.<ref>''JLA: The Nail'' #2</ref> In the sequel ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', the Outsiders are shown trying to find traces of his essence in the hope that he can be brought back to life, but they are interrupted by the current threat before they can determine if this is actually possible.\n\n===DC: The New Frontier===\nIn [[Darwyn Cooke]]'s 12-issue series, ''[[DC: The New Frontier]]'', Metamorpho appears with the rest of the Justice League at the end of the series.<ref>''DC: The New Frontier'' #12</ref>\n===Smallville===\nMetamorpho is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]]. He is a member of the Outsiders.<ref>''Smallville Season 11: Continuity'' Vol 1 #4 (May 2015)</ref>\n\n===Batman: Arkham Knight===\nIn ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' prequel comic, Metamorpho was the result of a project named '''Project: Meta''', an attempt to turn mud obtained from [[Clayface]] into weaponry by [[Stagg Enterprises]]. The project's head scientist, upon seeing [[Batman]] and [[Deadshot]] snooping around his lab, opened fire on the pair with a laser rifle, hitting the tank storing Metamorpho and freeing it. After a brief fight, which resulted in Metamorpho escaping into Stagg Enterprises' parking lot, Batman was engulfed. Using his line launcher, Batman escaped and threw three sonic [[Batarangs]] into its body, which exploded inside it. Batman then took some samples for later study.\n\n===Injustice: Gods Among Us===\nMetamorpho appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'''s prequel comic. He is depicted as a member of High Councillor Superman's Regime. In Year Four when [[Plastic Man]] breaks into the Regime's underwater prison to rescue his son, he is confronted by Metamorpho who is the prison warden. Before Metamorpho could act, Plastic Man teleports him, his son and all of the prison's inmates to a mirror dimension using some of [[Mirror Master]]'s technology. In Year Five after [[Deathstroke]] breaks into [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to get the [[Mother Box]] for [[Batman]] and [[Lex Luthor]], he is greeted by Metamorpho before he can leave. This results in Metamorpho's death after a tense fight against Deathstroke.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====DC Animated Universe====\n[[File:metamorpho.jpg|150px|thumb|Metamorpho in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n* Metamorpho appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]], voiced by [[Tom Sizemore]].

He was created in 1964 by writer [[Bob Haney]] and artist [[Ramona Fradon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=201}}</ref> \n\nMetamorpho is a founding member of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and has also joined multiple incarnations of the [[Justice League]]. The character has been moderately popular since his introduction in 1965. Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved.\n\n==Publication history==\nMetamorpho's creator, [[Bob Haney]], had seen success with DC Comics in 1963 with the titles ''[[Metal Men]]'' and ''[[Doom Patrol]]'', featuring bands of superheroes exhibiting fantastic powers. Under the editorial management of [[George Kashdan]], Haney was asked to capitalize on these titles' popularity with a similar character. Metamorpho, the Element Man, debuted in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #57 (January 1965).<ref>{{cite book| last= McAvennie |first= Michael| editor-last= Dolan| editor-first= Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle| publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 114 |quote = Scribe Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon were truly in their element...Haney and Fradon's collaborative chemistry resulted in [Rex] Mason becoming Metamorpho.}}</ref>\n\nAs first conceived, Metamorpho was a parody of the fantastic characters that populated comic books in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jones | first=Gerard |author2=Will Jacobs | title=The Comic Book Heroes | location=[[Rocklin, California]] | publisher=Prima Lifestyles | pages=76\u201377 | date=October 23, 1996 | isbn=978-0-7615-0393-4}}</ref> Artist [[Ramona Fradon]] was coaxed out of maternity retirement to illustrate Metamorpho's first appearances. The popularity of Metamorpho's appearances in ''The Brave and the Bold'' led to a 17-issue [[ongoing series]] between 1965 and 1968. Metamorpho also appeared during this time in two issues of ''Justice League of America'' (#42 and #44) and became the second superhero to decline an invitation to join that organization ([[Adam Strange]] being the first), though he did become a reservist, eventually being called in during a Justice League/Justice Society crossover to help find and rescue the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nMetamorpho appears on the cover of ''Aquaman'' #30 as one of the pallbearers (along with Batman, Hawkman, and Superman) at the \"Sea King's Funeral\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/aquaman-30-the-death-of-aquaman/4000-108970/ |title=Aquaman #30 - The Death of Aquaman |website=Comic Vine |access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> Metamorpho also appears in a series of backup stories in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #413\u2013418 and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #218\u2013220 and #229.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Stroud|first = Bryan|title = Metamorpho in ''Action Comics'' |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue = 64 |pages = 22\u201327| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date = May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Metamorpho appeared in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #3, a brief anthology series consisting of one-shots. That issue was written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Ramona Fradon, Metamorpho's creators. Haney and Fradon had met at the 1974 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], and while reminiscing, it emerged that both of them regarded Metamorpho as one of the features they'd most enjoyed working on, leading them to ask DC if they could do one more Metamorpho story together.<ref name=\"back71\">{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz |first= Jack| title= 1st Issue Special: It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant To Be)| journal= [[Back Issue!]]| issue=71 |page= 42| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date= April 2014 |location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Fradon later commented, \"I think we both felt that Metamorpho was our baby. I never had an experience like I had working with Bob Haney on ''Metamorpho''. It was like our minds were in perfect synch ... it was one of those wonderful collaborations that doesn't happen very often.\"<ref name=\"back71\"/>\n\nAfter becoming a charter member of the Outsiders in 1983, and member of the European branch of the [[Justice League International]], Metamorpho received his own four-issue mini-series in 1993.\n\nIn 2005, DC Comics reprinted Metamorpho's early ''The Brave and the Bold'' appearances and the entirety of the 1965 series as one of the company's volumes of ''[[Showcase Presents]]''.\n\nIn 2007, [[Dan Jurgens]] launched the six-issue series ''Metamorpho: Year One''.\n\nAs part of a ''[[Wednesday Comics]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]] wrote a 12-page Metamorpho story that [[Mike Allred]] illustrated.<ref>{{cite web | first= Remy | last= Minnick | url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19775 | title=Gaiman & Allred on Metamorpho | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 30, 2009 | accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref> In 2016 he starred in a new comic book series titled DC's ''Legends of Tomorrow''.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/articles/aaron-lopresti-talks-metamorpho-in-new-dcs-legends/1100-155102/ |title= Aaron Lopresti Talks Metamorpho in New DC's LEGENDS OF TOMORROW Series|work=Comic Vine |access-date= 2018-09-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nRex Mason is an adventurer who is hired by [[Stagg Enterprises]] CEO, [[Simon Stagg]], to retrieve a rare [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, the [[Orb of Ra]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/metamor.htm |title=Metamorpho the Element Man}}</ref> Shortly after hiring him, Simon Stagg learns that Mason has been dating his daughter, [[Sapphire Stagg]]. This and other incidents begin to fuel in Stagg a dislike for Mason that ultimately leads to a plot to kill him.\n\nIn an [[Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid]], Rex Mason is knocked unconscious by Simon's brutish bodyguard [[Java (comics)|Java]] and is eventually exposed to a radioactive [[meteoroid|meteor]]ite from which the Orb of [[Ra]] was fashioned. A tremendous flare-up of its radiation transforms Mason into Metamorpho, the Element Man. He gains the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and change himself into any [[chemical element|element]] or combination of elements found in the human body. It is also established in his origin story in ''[[The Brave & The Bold]]'' #57 that Metamorpho is virtually invulnerable in his inert (untransformed) state, when Stagg, afraid that Rex is going to kill him, shoots him point-blank without effect. The Orb of Ra, however, has the same effect on Rex that [[kryptonite]] has on [[Superman]]. Thus Stagg continues to control Metamorpho using the Orb. Later, it is revealed that Mason is but one of many [[metamorphae]]. They were created by the sun god Ra, using the meteorite, to serve as warriors in his battle against the god [[Apep]], \"the serpent who never dies.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | last1=Beatty | first1=Scott | authorlink1=Scott Beatty | last2=Jimenez | first2=Phil | authorlink2=Phil Jimenez | date=October 4, 2004 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Limited | isbn=978-0-7566-0592-6 | page=202}}</ref>\n\nMetamorpho, unlike most super-humanoids described in DC Comics, cannot assume a normal, fully human appearance, being no longer composed of flesh, blood and bone. As such, he regards his metamorphic powers as a disease and seeks a cure for his condition. Because he considers himself a freak and wishes only to be restored to his former human state, he rejects an offer of membership from the [[Justice League of America]] in ''JLA'' #42. [[Green Lantern]] attempts to change him back using his power ring, but due to a \"yellow\" component of the meteorite radiation, is unable to make him normal again.\n\nMetamorpho briefly has a crimefighting partner named Urania \"Rainie\" Blackwell, a woman who deliberately exposed herself to the Orb to gain its powers. She calls herself [[Element Girl]] (nicknamed \"the Chemical Doll\") and works with him on a number of cases.\n\nIssues #16\u201317 were intended to show a new direction for the series, with Sapphire marrying a man named Wally Bannister and Metamorpho joining a mysterious Mr. Shadow to deal with an immortal queen. Bent on world conquest, the queen (an exact lookalike of Sapphire) marries Metamorpho. She later steps outside her mystic city and instantly ages 2,000 years. When Wally Bannister is murdered by Algon (a metamorph who has lived for centuries in a depowered state), Metamorpho is [[frame-up|framed]]. Instead of coming to his defense against the false accusations, Metamorpho's colleague Mr. Shadow comes forth as an enemy. It is revealed that Mr. Shadow was attempting to enslave Metamorpho all along. Metamorpho is tried and convicted by a jury of rabble and is then executed by [[absolute zero]]; the first of what will become a series of multiple if temporary deaths.\n\nElement Girl revives Metamorpho, and Algon, the real murderer, is killed by molten lava minerals in an attempt to regain his burned-out powers. It is later learned that Mr. Bannister's murder was actually engineered by the villainous Prosecutor, who is then killed by an [[insectoid]] villain in a cocoon. At this point, issue #17 ends, and the story is never continued.\n\nMetamorpho reappears years later in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #101 (April\u2013May 1972). It is revealed that Metamorpho had spent the period after the end of his own series immersed in a painful chemical bath concocted by Stagg in an attempt to cure his condition. Stagg retrieves him from this \"cure\" too early because he needs Mason to save his endangered daughter Sapphire. Metamorpho stars in a new backup series beginning in ''Action'' #413 (June 1972). There is no reference in this revival series to the events or characters of his previous two issues.\n\nUrania Blackwell, unreferenced since the end of the regular series, is later revealed to have ended her partnership with Metamopho when her unrequited attraction to him became too much for her. Blackwell's powers are removed at her own request by Ra, resulting in her death; the episode, in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]],'' involves [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]]. Death mentions Algon's death in passing, trying to convince Blackwell that she will not live forever.\n\n===Outsiders===\nMetamorpho spends some time working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. While in the [[despotism|despotically]] ruled nation Mozombia, Metamorpho is subdued and dissassembled. The tyrant's forces keep him inert with a constant application of radiation. He is freed by [[Katana (comics)|Katana's]] indestructible sword, which had been latched onto a live electrical wire. While leaving Mozombia, the Outsiders' plane is shot down by the [[Bad Samaritan]]. Metamorpho and the others spend some time stranded on a deserted island, simply too far away from land to rescue themselves.\n\nMetamorpho perishes for the second time during the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event.<ref name= outsiders27>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Mike W. Barr|Barr, Mike W.]] | artist=[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]] | story= Robot Tyrants of Kadeyland! | title=The Outsiders | volume=1 | issue=27 | date=January 1988 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Doctor Jace, the scientific adviser to the Outsiders, has decided that life with the more logical [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] is preferable and she betrays the team; they fight back, but Metamorpho has been brainwashed into assisting Jace. He is killed in the resulting battle.<ref name=outsiders27/> He is again revived during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' miniseries, when a gene-bomb set off by invading aliens affects his biomass.\n\n===Justice League===\nMetamorpho spent some time with the Justice League, including [[Justice League Europe]]. There, he encounters Sapphire Stagg again. He becomes involved in a battle with the [[Metal Men]], who had been tricked by Simon. His League friends, [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]] and [[Animal Man]], were at the site of the battle, but were being detained by Java. At the conclusion of the battle, Metamorpho learns he had a son with Sapphire. Unfortunately, the baby boy's touch harmed all but Sapphire and Metamorpho. When Java held the baby, Java's arms melted. Metamorpho handed the baby over to Simon, who became convinced he would die, harmed like Java had been moments ago. However, something in his genetic structure protected him, just as it did with the baby's mother. Simon's stance softened and everyone was set free. [[Will Magnus|Doc Magnus]], the leader of the Metal Men, offered his services in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho's friends were puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he had hoped the baby would kill Simon.\n\nMetamorpho would later have a romantic relationship with [[Crimson Fox]], which was cut short by her apparent murder. His personal investigation of the incident uncovers multiple layers of lies and deceit. During his time with the team, while fighting the planet-smashing aliens called The Family, Metamorpho is hit by a powerful energy blast that destroys his body. He quickly re-forms in a totally different look. He will sport this new look until his next demise.\n\n===Second death===\nLater, the [[Hyperclan]] attacked the Justice League of America's [[Justice League Watchtower|orbiting base]], destroying it. Metamorpho protected three of his teammates, [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], and the original [[Icemaiden]], in a giant, fluid filled ball. The intent was for them to survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The three make it, injured but alive, but Metamorpho does not. He was buried with solemn honors. After a temporary resurrection by the wish-granting [[The Cathexis|Id]] (fundamentally flawed because the wisher, his son Joey, only wished for him to be ''back'' rather than to be ''alive''), he would return some time later.\n\n===Return===\nSapphire Stagg used the Orb of Ra to bring Metamorpho back to life, and he briefly joined the [[Doom Patrol]]. Shortly thereafter, an accident with one of Simon Stagg's experiments turned Simon, Sapphire, and Joey into an energy being, and caused Metamorpho to take on the form and personality of Java. \"Java\" kidnapped [[Black Canary]], asking for her help in rescuing the others. With Canary's help, he became Metamorpho again and managed to return the others to their normal forms.<ref>''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #51\u201352 (March\u2013April 2003)</ref>\n\n===Outsiders / \"Shift\"===\nAt the same time, Metamorpho had seemingly been appearing in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) series, but Rex Mason informed the team that their \"Metamorpho\" is a regrown fragment of his own body.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #7 (February 2004)</ref> Rex attempts to reassimilate his \"twin\", but the Outsiders convinced him that the twin deserves the chance to lead his own life. This second Metamorpho chose the name \"Shift\" and developed a relationship with [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]], becoming depressed over her death. After the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', Shift willingly chose to be reassimilated into Metamorpho, because he had killed several people. Rex has stepped in to fill Shift's position in the Outsiders, while a full account of Shift's crimes is explained in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) Annual; he had inadvertently killed 44 people during [[Black Lightning]]'s escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]].\n\nMetamorpho continued to serve on the Outsiders when [[Batman]] took over, and following its further restructuring following Batman's apparent death. He was apparently killed alongside the rest of the team in a satellite explosion orchestrated by [[Talia al Ghul]].<ref>''[[Batman Incorporated]]: Leviathan Strikes''</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nOn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, an August 2013 story reveals that the Outsiders are revealed to have survived. It is mentioned that Metamorpho was able to save the team by using the same technique he used to rescue the Justice League during the Hyperclan's attack many years ago.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> He is also shown as one of the candidates for the new [[Justice League International]], but he is ultimately not chosen.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Metamorpho is featured on the news as an example of the \"Superman Theory\" where the government has been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMetamorpho was transmuted into Nth Metal by Simon Stagg as part of his plot to open the portal to the Dark Multiverse. While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho as Plastic Man shields them from the Dark Multiverse energy which he is immune to. Upon arriving on a lifeless world, they encounter Phantom Girl who has been trapped in her intangible form and had no knowledge of sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of Tom Strong who states that they are needed to save the universe.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #1.

In the process of defeating him by using the Orb of Ra, Rex is turned human again.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #6. DC Comics. </ref> After the Terrifics disband post - the reveal that Java was Doctor Dread all along, Rex slowly comes to realize how worthless and boring he is without his heroic duties. On purpose, Rex and Element Dog sneak into Stagg Industries and use the Orb of Ra to turn back into their elemental selves, before rejoining the other heroes in a fight against Doctor Dread's Dreadfuls. After this battle, Rex is made chief security officer at Stagg Industries, and his relationship with Sapphire is repaired.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMetamorpho can transmute his body to any of a wide variety of elemental compounds and form it to his will. Originally, he was limited to the elements which occur naturally in the human body. Over time, this limitation seems to have disappeared. He can alter the shapes and consistencies of these elements and combine them to form complex compounds. Rex can assume forms of gas, liquid or solid states.\n\nMetamorpho can also shape parts and portions of his body instead of the whole. He can form such complex shapes as a tank and a bicycle and such simple forms as a cloud or a spring.\n\nThe nature of Rex's body provides him with natural body armor, offering damage resistance from blunt attacks and energy attacks.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Justice===\nRex Mason/Metamorpho appears in the 12-issue mini-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', as a member of the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice'' #7</ref>\n\n===JLA: The Nail===\nIn the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an unstable Metamorpho is forced to kill the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] by the [[Jimmy Olsen|unknown mastermind]] behind the recent anti-metahuman propaganda.

The project's head scientist, upon seeing [[Batman]] and [[Deadshot]] snooping around his lab, opened fire on the pair with a laser rifle, hitting the tank storing Metamorpho and freeing it. After a brief fight, which resulted in Metamorpho escaping into Stagg Enterprises' parking lot, Batman was engulfed. Using his line launcher, Batman escaped and threw three sonic [[Batarangs]] into its body, which exploded inside it. Batman then took some samples for later study.\n\n===Injustice: Gods Among Us===\nMetamorpho appears in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'''s prequel comic. He is depicted as a member of High Councillor Superman's Regime. In Year Four when [[Plastic Man]] breaks into the Regime's underwater prison to rescue his son, he is confronted by Metamorpho who is the prison warden. Before Metamorpho could act, Plastic Man teleports him, his son and all of the prison's inmates to a mirror dimension using some of [[Mirror Master]]'s technology. In Year Five after [[Deathstroke]] breaks into [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to get the [[Mother Box]] for [[Batman]] and [[Lex Luthor]], he is greeted by Metamorpho before he can leave. This results in Metamorpho's death after a tense fight against Deathstroke.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====DC Animated Universe====\n[[File:metamorpho.jpg|150px|thumb|Metamorpho in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]\n* Metamorpho appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]], voiced by [[Tom Sizemore]].

The town administers one village, Steierdorf (German: ''Steierdorf'', Hungarian: ''St\u00e1jerlak'').\n\n==Geology==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1956 |11837\n|1966 |14063\n|1977 |11478\n|1992 |11329\n|2002 |10594\n|2011 |7485\n}}\n\nIn 2002, the oldest modern human remains in [[Europe]] were discovered in a cave near Anina. Nicknamed ''\"Ion din Anina\"'' ([[John of Anina]]), the remains (the lower jaw) are some 40,000 years old.\n\nAnina represents one of the most important localities in the South Carpathians for Jurassic fossils, both plants and animals, as the geological heritage here is particularly diverse and well preserved (Popa, 2001, 2005). Anina is a fossile-Lagerstatte for Early Jurassic biota, the Hettangian-Sinemurian terrestrial Steierdorf Formation recording an extremely rich floral association, vertebrate and invertebrate tracks, traces and burrows. This paleontological heritage was uncovered also by significant mining works, such as underground mines and open cast mines, such works permitting the three-dimensional studies of the continental deposits, a unique opportunity in Europe and in the world, until the unfortunate closing of the last major mine in 2006. Still, the sterile dumps of the former mines and the former open cast mines of Ponor and Colonia Ceha very are rich in plant material, and they represent the subject of local conservation, as preserved sites or Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). \n[[File:Anina-Oravita 03 2010.jpg|thumb|left|225px|View from Oravi\u021ba - Anina [[mountain railway]] in 2010]]\n\nThe Early Jurassic (Hettangian - Sinemurian) flora is represented by Bryophytes (Hepaticae), Pteridophytes (Filicopsida, Sphenopsida, Lycopsida) and Gymnosperms (Pteridospermopsida, Ginkgopsida, Cycadopsida, Coniferopsida), with numerous coal generators (Givulescu, 1998, Popa and Van Konijnenburg - Van Cittert, 2005). Very rare vertebrate tunnels were recently described (Popa and Kedzior, 2006), such burrows being formerly reported only from three occurrences in the world (South Africa, Arizona and Argentina), tetrapod tracks such as ''Batrachopus'' cf. ''deweyi'' (Popa, 2000), and sauropod tracks of ''Parabrontopodus'' sp. type (Pienkowski et al., 2009).\n\nThe Middle Jurassic marine formations are also extremely rich in marine invertebrates and drifted floral remains, while the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous units display basinal and carbonate platform features (Bucur, 1997).\n\nThe coal mining industrial heritage is also significant, with Austrian industrial architecture and pits still preserved, such as the Northern Pit (Anina Pit I), Pit II, Pit IV (next to the Terezia Valley). Coal mining activities began in 1792, after the first coal outcrop was discovered by Matthew Hammer.\n\nThe Anina-Oravita railway built in 1863, it is still in use today for touristic purposes. It is one of the most beautiful railways in Europe due to very picturesque landscapes, viaducts and long tunnels. The railway preserves many aspects of the original  design and, as such, it does not comply with many [[International Union of Railways|UIC]] standards and it needs special, more powerful locomotives and shorter rail coaches to operate.\n\nAnina occurs between Cheile Nerei-Beusnita National Park and Semenic-Cheile Carasului National Park, and due to its natural and industrial heritage deserves the status of a geopark, a much needed status for such an important geological and historical area.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pe\u0219tera Muierilor]]\n* [[Pe\u0219tera cu Oase]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikivoyage|Anina}}\n{{Commons category|Anina}}\n* Bucur, I.I., 1997.

The town administers one village, Steierdorf (German: ''Steierdorf'', Hungarian: ''St\u00e1jerlak'').\n\n==Geology==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1956 |11837\n|1966 |14063\n|1977 |11478\n|1992 |11329\n|2002 |10594\n|2011 |7485\n}}\n\nIn 2002, the oldest modern human remains in [[Europe]] were discovered in a cave near Anina. Nicknamed ''\"Ion din Anina\"'' ([[John of Anina]]), the remains (the lower jaw) are some 40,000 years old.\n\nAnina represents one of the most important localities in the South Carpathians for Jurassic fossils, both plants and animals, as the geological heritage here is particularly diverse and well preserved (Popa, 2001, 2005). Anina is a fossile-Lagerstatte for Early Jurassic biota, the Hettangian-Sinemurian terrestrial Steierdorf Formation recording an extremely rich floral association, vertebrate and invertebrate tracks, traces and burrows. This paleontological heritage was uncovered also by significant mining works, such as underground mines and open cast mines, such works permitting the three-dimensional studies of the continental deposits, a unique opportunity in Europe and in the world, until the unfortunate closing of the last major mine in 2006. Still, the sterile dumps of the former mines and the former open cast mines of Ponor and Colonia Ceha very are rich in plant material, and they represent the subject of local conservation, as preserved sites or Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). \n[[File:Anina-Oravita 03 2010.jpg|thumb|left|225px|View from Oravi\u021ba - Anina [[mountain railway]] in 2010]]\n\nThe Early Jurassic (Hettangian - Sinemurian) flora is represented by Bryophytes (Hepaticae), Pteridophytes (Filicopsida, Sphenopsida, Lycopsida) and Gymnosperms (Pteridospermopsida, Ginkgopsida, Cycadopsida, Coniferopsida), with numerous coal generators (Givulescu, 1998, Popa and Van Konijnenburg - Van Cittert, 2005). Very rare vertebrate tunnels were recently described (Popa and Kedzior, 2006), such burrows being formerly reported only from three occurrences in the world (South Africa, Arizona and Argentina), tetrapod tracks such as ''Batrachopus'' cf. ''deweyi'' (Popa, 2000), and sauropod tracks of ''Parabrontopodus'' sp. type (Pienkowski et al., 2009).\n\nThe Middle Jurassic marine formations are also extremely rich in marine invertebrates and drifted floral remains, while the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous units display basinal and carbonate platform features (Bucur, 1997).\n\nThe coal mining industrial heritage is also significant, with Austrian industrial architecture and pits still preserved, such as the Northern Pit (Anina Pit I), Pit II, Pit IV (next to the Terezia Valley). Coal mining activities began in 1792, after the first coal outcrop was discovered by Matthew Hammer.\n\nThe Anina-Oravita railway built in 1863, it is still in use today for touristic purposes. It is one of the most beautiful railways in Europe due to very picturesque landscapes, viaducts and long tunnels. The railway preserves many aspects of the original  design and, as such, it does not comply with many [[International Union of Railways|UIC]] standards and it needs special, more powerful locomotives and shorter rail coaches to operate.\n\nAnina occurs between Cheile Nerei-Beusnita National Park and Semenic-Cheile Carasului National Park, and due to its natural and industrial heritage deserves the status of a geopark, a much needed status for such an important geological and historical area.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pe\u0219tera Muierilor]]\n* [[Pe\u0219tera cu Oase]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikivoyage|Anina}}\n{{Commons category|Anina}}\n* Bucur, I.I., 1997.

In this scheme, total contributions per member would be 30.7% of salary, with 9.6% being paid by the employee and 21.1% by the employer. A further valuation would follow in 2020 and in the absence of an alternative agreement, the contribution rate would rise to 34.7% in October 2021 with members paying 11% and employers 23.7%. UCU argued that employees' contributions should not rise above 8%, and that the Joint Expert Panel had suggested alternative paths to achieving this that had been agreeable to both UCU and UUK. UUK offered to limit staff contributions to 9.1% instead of 9.6% if UCU would agree to hold no strikes on pensions for two years, an offer which UCU rejected.<ref>Richard Adams,

Ballots were undertaken separately for each institution in the belief that turnout might pass the 50% of members required by the [[Trade Union Act 2016]] at a sufficient number of institutions to enable meaningful industrial action, while averting the risk of an aggregated national ballot falling below the 50% threshold.

In this scheme, total contributions per member would be 30.7% of salary, with 9.6% being paid by the employee and 21.1% by the employer. A further valuation would follow in 2020 and in the absence of an alternative agreement, the contribution rate would rise to 34.7% in October 2021 with members paying 11% and employers 23.7%. UCU argued that employees' contributions should not rise above 8%, and that the Joint Expert Panel had suggested alternative paths to achieving this that had been agreeable to both UCU and UUK. UUK offered to limit staff contributions to 9.1% instead of 9.6% if UCU would agree to hold no strikes on pensions for two years, an offer which UCU rejected.<ref>Richard Adams,

Ballots were undertaken separately for each institution in the belief that turnout might pass the 50% of members required by the [[Trade Union Act 2016]] at a sufficient number of institutions to enable meaningful industrial action, while averting the risk of an aggregated national ballot falling below the 50% threshold.
