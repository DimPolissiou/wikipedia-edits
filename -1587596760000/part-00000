The proposal developed further during discussions with Beyer, Peacock regarding issues with the design of the W Class locomotive.<ref name=Pusenjak/>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:XA1402, Forrestfield, 1987.JPG|left|upright|thumb|XA 1402 at [[Forrestfield, Western Australia|Forrestfield]] Yard in August 1987]]\n\nThe X class revolutionised operations on the WAGR. Their light axle load of around 12 tons meant they could travel on all lines, and the dual cab arrangement eliminated the need for turning. They were quickly allocated to express passenger trains including the ''[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] Express'', ''[[Transwa Australind|Australind]]'', ''[[Kalgoorlie]] Express'' and ''[[The Westland]]''. Although considered as good runners, the eight driving wheels being attached to the rigid main frame caused these locomotives to ride roughly.\n\n==The Crossley engine==\nAt the time of construction, the HST-V8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Doncaster |first=N |title=The Crossley Experience |journal=The Partyline - the in-house magazine of Steamtown Peterborough |number=71 |date=Spring 1998}}</ref> One line of thought is the motor was an evolution of either of the HRN8 marine diesel, or the HRP8 stationary diesel.<ref name=Pusenjak>{{cite journal |last=Pusenjak |first=N |year=2014 |title=The WAGR X Class Locomotive; A look back with today's hindsight |journal=The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA |edition=Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, |pages=5-18}}</ref>\n\nFailures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's [[Midland Railway Workshops]] that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam.\n\nThe engines used Crossley's system of [[exhaust pulse pressure charging]] and developed 1,200 horsepower (895&nbsp;kW) at 625&nbsp;rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875&nbsp;hp at 600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.\n\nThe engines burnt and leaked oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives. It was only the engineering excellence, and perseverance of Midland Railway Workshops staff that kept the locomotives operating, and performance improving. In the end, over 600 design faults, mainly in the Crossley engine, were overcome. One of the strategies used to minimise problems was to de-rate the engine to 1045hp (officially quoted as 1000hp).\n\nBecause of the multitudinous problems, rumours persisted that the engine was either war surplus, or formerly from a sub-maritime application.<ref name=OB1 >{{cite book |last=Oberg |first=Leon |title=Locomotives of Australia |publisher=Reed Books |year=1975}}</ref> Neither of these are correct, despite some publications suggesting this.<ref name=LOberg >{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=214}}</ref> The myth may have arisen from Crossleys success in delivering robust engines for marine and other modes of transport. Experience in Western Australia with both Metropolitan Vickers and Crossly engines was otherwise positive.<ref name=Pusenjak/> It has been noted that the Irish Railways [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann|(CI\u00c9)]], through the respected Engineer [[Oliver Bulleid]], had \"heard\" through the British Admiralty that the \"Crossley unit gave no trouble\".<ref name=rhen >Renehan,D: \"Crossley diesels of CIE\" ''Journal of the Irish Railway Record Society'', Volume 15, pp. 25-35 and 70-79.</ref>\n\nThe Smith Royal Commission into the class identified blind faith in the British manufacturers, and chided the WAGR for ignoring the advice of supervising engineers in the UK who reported problems with the diesel motor during testing.<ref>Smith Royal Commission (dates pending)</ref> Whilst CI\u00c9 re-engined their similarly powered Crossley [[CIE 001 Class|001 Class]] locomotives to rid themselves of the problem,<ref name=rhen/> The Smith Royal Commission recommended against rebuilding, proposing that the entire class be replaced wholesale. To be fair to the WAGR, they were not the only ones that rushed into buying unproven traction: [[British Rail|British Railways]] also did the same, buying many different types of diesel locomotives from many different manufacturers in their haste to dieselise, including purchasing the [[British Rail Class 28|unsuccessful Class 28 Co-Bo locomotives]], which could be regarded as \"first cousins\" to the WAGR X class.<ref>Wragg,D 2004 : Signal Failure.

This equipment was removed in the early 1980s, only to be reinstalled in XA 1406 (October 1986) and XA 1403 (November 1986) to allow these units to haul ex-[[Queensland Rail|Queensland Railways]] coaches on suburban services.\n\n==End of career==\nIn their final years, those still in service were reputed to have performed well. They ran grain trains in the South West as late as 1984, and provided power for trains following the reopening of the Fremantle line up to the last retirement (XA 1402) in 1988.\n\nThe first were withdrawn in 1973, primarily as sources of spare parts. The last in service, Xa1402 was withdrawn on 31 March 1988, after completing a transfer working.<ref name=Barbs>Barber, S 2014: X Class Reminders: The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA - Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, Myths and Memories pp25-26 </ref>\n\nThe last of the class to operate on the public network was Xa1401, working a consist of sleeping cars back from Dowerin on 27 August 2004.<ref name=Barbs/>\n\n==Names==\nThe locomotives carried the names of tribes, tribal leaders and warriors from around Australia. Within the WAGR, proposals were made to code the class as \"T\", and for the class to be known as the \"Tribal class\". This was not adopted. However, confusion at the time resulted in duplications and incorrect spellings.\n\nWithin the WAGR, the class earnt the nickname \"Hummingbirds\" while they were called \"Submarines\" by rail enthusiasts.\n\n==Status list==\nThe 48 locomotives were:<ref>[http://www.hothamvalleyrailway.com.au/xa_diesel_loco.htm XA Class Diesel Electric Locomotive] Hotham Valley Railway</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tindale's Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes|url=http://archives.samuseum.sa.gov.au/tindaletribes/index.html|publisher=[[South Australian Museum]]|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Class\n!No\n!Locomotive name\n!Indigenous group\n!Status\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1001\n|''[[Yellagonga|Yalagonga]]''\n| [[Whadjuk]]\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1002\n|''Bibbulmun''\n|Pibelmen\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1003\n|''Ditu-Wonga''\n|Nangatadjara\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1004\n|''Kadjerden''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1005\n|''Meananger'' \n|[[Minangkabau people|Minang]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1006\n|''Nangamada''\n|Njangamarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1007\n|''Natingaro''\n|Kalamaia\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1008\n|''Warrangoo''\n|[[Koreng]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1009\n|''Arnga''\n|Arnga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1010\n|''Arawodi''\n|Arnga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1011\n|''Balgua''\n|Bailgu\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1012\n|''Ballardong''\n|Balardong\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1013\n|''Boonara''\n|Ngardi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1014\n|''Churoro''\n|Tjuroro\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1015\n|''Cheangwa''\n|Wadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1016\n|''Djukin''\n|[[Jukun people (Australia)|Djugun]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1017\n|''Ewenyoon''\n|Djaui\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1018\n|''Inpirra''\n|Inggarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1019\n|''Ingarra''\n|Inggarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1020\n|''Jargurdi''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1021\n|''Jarroo''\n|Djaru\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1022\n|''Kardagur''\n|Wardandi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1023\n|''Kariera''\n|Kariara\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1024\n|''Kogara''\n|Murunitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1025\n|''Loonga''\n|Kitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1026\n|''Mangala''\n|Mangarla\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1027\n|''Marangal''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1028\n|''Meeraman''\n|Pibelmen\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1029\n|''Muliarra''\n|Wadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1030\n|''Mooroon''\n|Murunitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1031\n|''Yauera''\n|Jawuru\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1032\n|''Yeithi''\n|Jeidji\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n{{Col-2-of-2}}\n\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Class\n!Road<br>no\n!Locomotive name\n!Indigenous group\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1401\n|''Pedong''\n|Kokatja\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1402\n|''Targari''\n|Targari\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1403\n|''Wanbiri''\n|[[Mirning people|Mirning]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1404\n|''Pardoo''\n|Kokatja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1405\n|''Warienga''\n|Wariangga\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1406\n|''Ungarinyin''\n|Ngarinjin\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1407\n|''Wirngir''\n|Wirngir\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1408\n|''Wolmeri''\n|Walmadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1409\n|''Unambal''\n|Wunambal\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1410\n|''Tenma''\n|Tenma\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1411\n|''Weedookarri''\n|Njamal\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1412\n|''Noala''\n|Noala\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1413\n|''Yabaroo''\n|Wardandi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1414\n|''Yindi''\n|Maduwongga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1415\n|''Wurara''\n|Worora\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1416\n|''Niligara''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Preservation==\nOne X class and five XA class locomotives have been preserved:\n* X 1001 ''Yalagonga'' -

Although considered as good runners, the eight driving wheels being attached to the rigid main frame caused these locomotives to ride roughly.\n\n==The Crossley engine==\nAt the time of construction, the HST-V8 was an untested concept, though the engine itself was an evolution of a design used successfully in patrol boats during World War Two.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Doncaster |first=N |title=The Crossley Experience |journal=The Partyline - the in-house magazine of Steamtown Peterborough |number=71 |date=Spring 1998}}</ref> One line of thought is the motor was an evolution of either of the HRN8 marine diesel, or the HRP8 stationary diesel.<ref name=Pusenjak>{{cite journal |last=Pusenjak |first=N |year=2014 |title=The WAGR X Class Locomotive; A look back with todays hindsight |journal=The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA |edition=Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, |pages=5-18}}</ref>\n\nFailures commenced within weeks of the first locomotives being unveiled. It was only the skill of staff at WAGR's [[Midland Railway Workshops]] that saved the day. In their early days, availability was less than for steam.\n\nThe engines used Crossley's system of [[exhaust pulse pressure charging]] and developed 1,200 horsepower (895&nbsp;kW) at 625&nbsp;rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875&nbsp;hp at 600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.\n\nThe engines burnt and leaked oil, had underfed bearings, vibrated and popped heads and pistons, and suffered from ring scuffing for most of their lives. It was only the engineering excellence, and perseverance of Midland Railway Workshops staff that kept the locomotives operating, and performance improving. In the end, over 600 design faults, mainly in the Crossley engine, were overcome. One of the strategies used to minimise problems was to de-rate the engine to 1045hp (officially quoted as 1000hp).\n\nBecause of the multitudinous problems, rumours persisted that the engine was either war surplus, or formerly from a sub-maritime application.<ref name=OB1 >{{cite book |last=Oberg |first=Leon |title=Locomotives of Australia |publisher=Reed Books |year=1975}}</ref> Neither of these are correct, despite some publications suggesting this.<ref name=LOberg >{{cite book|last=Oberg|first=Leon|title=Locomotives of Australia 1850s-1980s|year=1984|publisher=Reed Books|location=Frenchs Forest|isbn=0 730100 05 7|page=214}}</ref> The myth may have arisen from Crossleys success in delivering robust engines for marine and other modes of transport. Experience in Western Australia with both Metropolitan Vickers and Crossly engines was otherwise positive.<ref name=Pusenjak/> It has been noted that the Irish Railways [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann|(CI\u00c9)]], through the respected Engineer [[Oliver Bulleid]], had \"heard\" through the British Admiralty that the \"Crossley unit gave no trouble\".<ref name=rhen >Renehan,D: \"Crossley diesels of CIE\" ''Journal of the Irish Railway Record Society'', Volume 15, pp. 25-35 and 70-79.</ref>\n\nThe Smith Royal Commission into the class identified blind faith in the British manufacturers, and chided the WAGR for ignoring the advice of supervising engineers in the UK who reported problems with the diesel motor during testing.<ref>Smith Royal Commission (dates pending)</ref> Whilst CI\u00c9 re-engined their similarly powered Crossley [[CIE 001 Class|001 Class]] locomotives to rid themselves of the problem,<ref name=rhen/> The Smith Royal Commission recommended against rebuilding, proposing that the entire class be replaced wholesale. To be fair to the WAGR, they were not the only ones that rushed into buying unproven traction: [[British Rail|British Railways]] also did the same, buying many different types of diesel locomotives from many different manufacturers in their haste to dieselise, including purchasing the [[British Rail Class 28|unsuccessful Class 28 Co-Bo locomotives]], which could be regarded as \"first cousins\" to the WAGR X class.<ref>Wragg,D 2004 : Signal Failure. Politics and Britains Railways Sutton Publishing</ref>\n\n==Multiple unit working==\n[[File:X1007.jpg|thumb|X 1007 in [[Old Bunbury railway station|Bunbury]]]]\nDuring construction, 16 locomotives were fitted with multiple unit control and denoted as XA class.<ref>Richardson, LC \"The Western Australian Government Railways X-Class Diesel-Electric Locomotive\" [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] March 1955, pp. 25-28.</ref><ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/xa-class-diesel-wa XA Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref> These locomotives included communication doors at each end, and were numbered in a separate block starting from 1401.\n\nFrom December 1963, Midland Workshops fitted 10 of the X class for multiple unit working, and these were reclassified as XB class.<ref name=LOberg/><ref>[http://www.railpage.com.au/locos/xb-class-diesel-wa XB Class (diesel, WA)] Railpage</ref> Units so converted were not fitted with communication doors, and retained their original 10XX series numbers.\n\n==Other modifications==\nWhilst the class were built with locomotive pneumatic braking and train vacuum braking systems, during 1969 and 1970 eight of the XA class were modified to operate with dual vacuum/air braking systems manufactured by [[Davies and Metcalfe]] to allow them to operate air-braked salt traffic on the Esperance Branch. This equipment was removed in the early 1980s, only to be reinstalled in XA 1406 (October 1986) and XA 1403 (November 1986) to allow these units to haul ex-[[Queensland Rail|Queensland Railways]] coaches on suburban services.\n\n==End of career==\nIn their final years, those still in service were reputed to have performed well. They ran grain trains in the South West as late as 1984, and provided power for trains following the reopening of the Fremantle line up to the last retirement (XA 1402) in 1988.\n\nThe first were withdrawn in 1973, primarily as sources of spare parts. The last in service, Xa1402 was withdrawn on 31 March 1988, after completing a transfer working.<ref name=Barbs>Barber, S 2014: X Class Reminders: The Westland: The Journal of Rail Heritage WA - Special Edition X Class 60th Anniversary, Myths and Memories pp25-26 </ref>\n\nThe last of the class to operate on the public network was Xa1401, working a consist of sleeping cars back from Dowerin on 27 August 2004.<ref name=Barbs/>\n\n==Names==\nThe locomotives carried the names of tribes, tribal leaders and warriors from around Australia. Within the WAGR, proposals were made to code the class as \"T\", and for the class to be known as the \"Tribal class\". This was not adopted. However, confusion at the time resulted in duplications and incorrect spellings.\n\nWithin the WAGR, the class earnt the nickname \"Hummingbirds\" while they were called \"Submarines\" by rail enthusiasts.\n\n==Status list==\nThe 48 locomotives were:<ref>[http://www.hothamvalleyrailway.com.au/xa_diesel_loco.htm XA Class Diesel Electric Locomotive] Hotham Valley Railway</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tindale's Catalogue of Australian Aboriginal Tribes|url=http://archives.samuseum.sa.gov.au/tindaletribes/index.html|publisher=[[South Australian Museum]]|accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Class\n!No\n!Locomotive name\n!Indigenous group\n!Status\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1001\n|''[[Yellagonga|Yalagonga]]''\n| [[Whadjuk]]\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1002\n|''Bibbulmun''\n|Pibelmen\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1003\n|''Ditu-Wonga''\n|Nangatadjara\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1004\n|''Kadjerden''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1005\n|''Meananger'' \n|[[Minangkabau people|Minang]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1006\n|''Nangamada''\n|Njangamarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1007\n|''Natingaro''\n|Kalamaia\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1008\n|''Warrangoo''\n|[[Koreng]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1009\n|''Arnga''\n|Arnga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1010\n|''Arawodi''\n|Arnga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1011\n|''Balgua''\n|Bailgu\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1012\n|''Ballardong''\n|Balardong\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1013\n|''Boonara''\n|Ngardi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1014\n|''Churoro''\n|Tjuroro\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1015\n|''Cheangwa''\n|Wadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1016\n|''Djukin''\n|[[Jukun people (Australia)|Djugun]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1017\n|''Ewenyoon''\n|Djaui\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1018\n|''Inpirra''\n|Inggarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1019\n|''Ingarra''\n|Inggarda\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1020\n|''Jargurdi''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1021\n|''Jarroo''\n|Djaru\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1022\n|''Kardagur''\n|Wardandi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1023\n|''Kariera''\n|Kariara\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1024\n|''Kogara''\n|Murunitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1025\n|''Loonga''\n|Kitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1026\n|''Mangala''\n|Mangarla\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1027\n|''Marangal''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1028\n|''Meeraman''\n|Pibelmen\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1029\n|''Muliarra''\n|Wadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1030\n|''Mooroon''\n|Murunitja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|X\n|1031\n|''Yauera''\n|Jawuru\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XB\n|1032\n|''Yeithi''\n|Jeidji\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n{{Col-2-of-2}}\n\n{|cellpadding=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Class\n!Road<br>no\n!Locomotive name\n!Indigenous group\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1401\n|''Pedong''\n|Kokatja\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1402\n|''Targari''\n|Targari\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1403\n|''Wanbiri''\n|[[Mirning people|Mirning]]\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1404\n|''Pardoo''\n|Kokatja\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1405\n|''Warienga''\n|Wariangga\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1406\n|''Ungarinyin''\n|Ngarinjin\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1407\n|''Wirngir''\n|Wirngir\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1408\n|''Wolmeri''\n|Walmadjari\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1409\n|''Unambal''\n|Wunambal\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1410\n|''Tenma''\n|Tenma\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1411\n|''Weedookarri''\n|Njamal\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1412\n|''Noala''\n|Noala\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1413\n|''Yabaroo''\n|Wardandi\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1414\n|''Yindi''\n|Maduwongga\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1415\n|''Wurara''\n|Worora\n|Preserved\n|-\n|align=right|XA\n|1416\n|''Niligara''\n|\n|Scrapped\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Preservation==\nOne X class and five XA class locomotives have been preserved:\n* X 1001 ''Yalagonga'' -

Although other online databases may contain more games (which are not necessarily screened for quality), they typically do not permit external links to individual games or allow for kibitzing on each game. According to its webmaster, Chessgames strives for quality games without participating in the arms-race mentality that produces chess databases containing millions of questionable games.\n\n==Membership==\nThe site has over 197,000 registered members (of whom about 7 percent have visited over the last three months), with 2,500 new members per month.<ref name=\"statistics\"/> At any time, several hundred people are actively using the site.<ref name=\"ct20061101\"/> A sample of Group demographics from a 2005 questionnaire: 98 percent male, 50 percent from North America, average rating 1600\u20131800 with one third unrated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/pollresults.html | title=Chessgames.com Questionnaire | publisher=Chessgames.com | date=2005-09-12 | accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> Members post messages under a specific username, which may be their real identity or an anonymous handle.\n\nProminent Chessgames.com members include former Women's World Champion [[Susan Polgar]], former World Championship candidate [[Nigel Short]], former \nU.S. Champion [[Gata Kamsky]], chess authors Grandmaster [[Raymond Keene]] and [[FIDE Master]] [[Eric Schiller]], [[FIDE Master]] [[Jonathan Sarfati]], past [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] President Grandmaster [[Maxim Dlugy]], International Master Lawrence Day, and Woman Grandmasters [[Natalia Pogonina]] and [[Yelena Dembo]].

This enables a member who desires to do so to pattern his opening play after a famous player.\n*Guess-the-Move is a chess training tool where members play through a database game and try to predict the following move, receiving points for correctly choosing those moves actually played.\n*The ChessBookie Game is a free gambling simulation using play money (\"chessbucks\") to predict the outcomes of games in major tournaments. Real time leaderboards track the top predictors. Winners receive various prizes, such as site memberships, gift certificates, chess books and supplies.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn 2013, [[Chesscafe.com]] columnist and chess historian [[Olimpiu G.

If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.\n\nFor every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences.\nIn order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users\u2019 demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:\n\n\u00b7The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.\n\n\u00b7Your advises and reviews of the product.\n\n\u00b7The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.\n\n\u00b7The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.\n\n\u00b7The overall satisfaction level towards the product.\n\n=== Alipay ===\n{{main|Alipay}}\nLaunched in 2004, Alipay ({{zh|s=\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d|t=\u652f\u4ed8\u5bf6|p=Zh\u012bf\u00f9b\u01ceo}}), an [[escrow]]-based [[online payment]] platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace.

According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\" />\n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever.

Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\n=== Developing Strategy ===\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms.\nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Adaptive Agent ===\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers\u2019 purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).\n*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).\n*The category model of a product (correlation rate).\n*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).\n*The sellers model (quality score).\n*The feedback (quality score).\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Semantic Search ===\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications.\n\n=== Taobao for Southeast Asia ===\n\nIn September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site.

Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences.\nIn order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users\u2019 demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:\n\n\u00b7The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.\n\n\u00b7Your advises and reviews of the product.\n\n\u00b7The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.\n\n\u00b7The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.\n\n\u00b7The overall satisfaction level towards the product.\n\n=== Alipay ===\n{{main|Alipay}}\nLaunched in 2004, Alipay ({{zh|s=\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d|t=\u652f\u4ed8\u5bf6|p=Zh\u012bf\u00f9b\u01ceo}}), an [[escrow]]-based [[online payment]] platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace. It is the most widely used third-party online payment solution in China.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alibaba is building its Alipay payments service into the PayPal of the East|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/10/17/alibaba-is-building-its-alipay-payments-service-into-the-paypal-of-the-east/|work=The Next Web|date=17 October 2013|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> To ensure safe transactions, Alipay uses an escrow system through which payment is only released to the seller once the buyer has received his or her goods in satisfactory condition. According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\" />\n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever. Top-tier digital payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay are expected to transfer all relevant transaction data to appropriate agencies starting June 30, 2018.\n\n=== AliExpress ===\n{{main|AliExpress}}\n[[File:Aliexpress.jpg|thumb|Aliexpress]]\nAliExpress was created in April 2010 as an international retailing website. People who live overseas can use the service to purchase items from Chinese manufactures online.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alibaba Group Offitional website|url=http://www.alibabagroup.com/cn/about/businesses}}</ref>\n\n=== AliWangWang (TradeManager) ===\n\nA distinctive feature of shopping on Taobao Marketplace is the ease of communication between buyer and seller prior to the purchase through its embedded proprietary instant [[chat program]], named '''AliWangWang''' ({{zh|s=\u963f\u91cc\u65fa\u65fa|p=\u0100l\u01d0W\u00e0ngW\u00e0ng}}). It has become a habit among Chinese online shoppers to interact with the sellers through AliWangWang to inquire about products and to bargain prior to purchasing products.\n\n=== Baopals ===\n\nIn February 2016, 3 expats living in Shanghai launched [[Baopals]], a shopping platform that translates Taobao and [[Tmall]] into English so that foreigners living in China can access all of its products and services. Currently, over 2.4 million items have been sold on the platform.\n\n=== Happy Taobao ===\n\nIn Dec. 2009, Taobao, together with [[Hunan TV]], set up Happy Taobao, Inc for television shopping. Hunan TV launched an entertainment series called \"Happy Taobao\", while [[Taobao Marketplace]] created channels and independent websites.\n\n=== Other services ===\n\nTaobao Marketplace introduced various features and services to create a better user experience for online shoppers and retailers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shopping from China Taobao Shops|url=http://www.offerany.com/|website=OfferAny}}</ref> For instance, in January 2010, it launched the Taobao app, created by independent developers through the Taobao Open Platform, to be downloaded by consumers in Taobao App Store.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Taobao Launches New Taobao App Store\".

After the event was launched, it obtained unexpected attention so many other e-commerce company tried to imitate this model. However, Taobao mall is still the best beneficiary by its accurate and powerful promotion skills till now.\n\nThe double eleven shopping day has gained a large number of profit for Taobao since 2009. The sales value on double eleven in 2009 was RMB50 million (\uffe15.68 million) and the value has increased sharply to RMB35 billion (\uffe13.97 billion) and the RMB1.5 billion(\uffe1170million) was gained.<ref name=\"Review of Sales Value on Double 11: 2009-2013 Read more: https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/10400/review-sales-value-double-11-2009-2013/#ixzz5ABnxGZPl\">{{cite web|title=Review of Sales Value on Double 11: 2009-2013 |url=https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/10400/review-sales-value-double-11-2009-2013/#ixzz5ABnxGZPl|website=China Internet Watch|date=6 November 2014|publisher=CIW Team|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nHere are the volume of transaction from 2009 to 2019 on Taobao mall for November 11:\n\n2009: RMB50 million (\uffe15.68 million)\n\n2010: RMB900 million (\uffe1102 million)\n\n2011: RMB3.4 billion (\uffe1386 million)\n\n2012: RMB19.1 billion (\uffe12.17 billion)\n\n2013: RMB35 billion (\uffe13.97 billion)\n\n2015: RMB91.2 billion\n\n2016: RMB120.7 billion2017: RMB168.2 billion\n\n2018: RMB213.5 billion\n\n2019: RMB268.4 billion\n\nIt also shows great power from 2014 to 2018, with the volume of transaction from 213.5 billion in 2018.\n\nThe continuous successes of Taobao mall double eleven shopping carnival contributes to its varieties of promotion skills and the supportive of quantities of firms. In 2016, Alibaba has introduce the T-mall double eleven party, it invited many popular stars, singers and supermodel who took part in Victoria secret show. The party also invited stars such as [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[the Beckhams]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In the 2017 double eleven party, Jack Ma came out with his new film ''Gongshoudao'' which means defend the homeland with Kungfu.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nNow, because of the huge trading volume and income in Singles Day(11/11), Taobao has launched another promotional activity on December 12, which is the similar e-commerce sales day to Singles' Day. Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\n=== Developing Strategy ===\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms.\nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Adaptive Agent ===\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers\u2019 purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).\n*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).\n*The category model of a product (correlation rate).\n*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).\n*The sellers model (quality score).\n*The feedback (quality score).\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Semantic Search ===\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications.\n\n=== Taobao for Southeast Asia ===\n\nIn September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site. A translation feature is now available on Taobao.com for major languages in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taobao for Southeast Asia|url=http://www.taobaothailand.com/taobao-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203195115/http://www.taobaothailand.com/taobao-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB/|archivedate=2014-02-03}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate social responsibility ==\n\nIn August 2017, in order to protect African children from being commercially exploited, the company has removed a controversial vendor ad campaign.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chinese vendors 'exploiting' African children removed from Taobao|work=BBC News|date=18 August 2017|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40958209|last1=Zhao|first1=Yashan}}</ref>\n\n== Metrics ==\n\nTaobao Marketplace had more than 5 million registered users as of June 2013 and hosted more than 80 million product listings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.alibaba.com/specials/aboutalibaba/aligroup/index.html|title=Alibaba Group|website=news.alibaba.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> It facilitated approximately RMB 200 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taobao app|url=http://news.alibaba.com/article/detail/alibaba/100237896-1-taobao-launches-new-taobao-app.html|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> In September 2013, Taobao ranked 12th overall in Alexa's internet rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/taobao.com|title=Taobao.com Traffic, Demographics and Competitors - Alexa|website=www.alexa.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> For the year ending March 31, 2013, the combined gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Taobao and Tmall.com combined exceeded RMB 1 trillion.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.taobao.com}} {{in lang|zh}}\n\n{{Alibaba Group}}\n\n[[Category:2003 establishments in China]]\n[[Category:Alibaba Group]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2003]]\n[[Category:Notorious markets]]\n[[Category:Chinese brands]]\n[[Category:Online marketplaces of China]]\n", "name_user": "AdriFlores22", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao"}

They reside in the fictional town of Porkbelly, which is in the USA or Canada. Johnny is often used as a [[Human subject research|test subject]] for his genius twin sisters' inventions and experiments, which range from gadgets to superpowers. Their experiments often cause problems that he must resolve and he must sometimes fight villains in the process. He occasionally saves the world with his sisters' inventions.\n\nOn June 11, 2013, Teletoon announced that the series had been renewed for a seventh season, to consist of 13 episodes and a three-part special.<ref name=\"newswire1\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1181701/inspector-gadget-reboot-tops-off-teletoon-canada-s-latest-original-production-slate |title=TELETOON Canada Inc. &#124; Inspector Gadget Reboot Tops Off TELETOON Canada's Latest Original Production Slate |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> However, in response to a tweet on June 25, 2015, regarding a seventh season, voice actor [[James Arnold Taylor]] stated that he was unaware of any plans for a seventh season.<ref name=season7>{{Cite tweet |user=jatactor|author=James Arnold Taylor |number=614207327277871104 |date=June 25, 2015|title=Is there any chance of season 7 of Johnny test coming out? |access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the official ''Johnny Test'' [[YouTube]] channel released a video confirming the show would inspire a series of web-shorts by [[WildBrain Spark]], a subsidiary of [[WildBrain]] that produces original content for online distribution.

The Test Twins frequently use Johnny as a [[Human experimentation|guinea pig]] for their various experiments and inventions in their laboratory filled with highly advanced technology built in over the Tests' household attic, with most of which they try to impress their pretty boy next-door neighbor, Gil, for whom both harbor a deep love and obsession, although their attempts to come up with some way to attract his attention usually end in failure.\n\nJohnny is a troublesome and mischievous boy who causes problems in the family and often within the city. His best friend is his [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking pet dog, Dukey, who Susan and Mary gave human-level intelligence and the ability to speak in an experiment. Because Johnny has Susan, Mary and Dukey by his side, he can live any kid's dream, only to find that most dreams never turn out as hoped. He is very hyperactive and often messes with his sisters' inventions, causing trouble and mayhem, but just as often proves himself to be clever such as by frequently tricking his sisters or saving the day from whatever danger happens to show up. Johnny is also stubborn and a bit spoiled, as he gets what he wants through deceit, blackmail, or manipulation. However, he does have a sense of justice and always learns from his mistakes. However, he, like most kids, does not like school; if anything, he goes to great lengths to avoid doing work, often using his sisters' inventions to do so and often putting himself and/or others in trouble as a result.\n\nOne of Johnny's main nemeses is Eugene \"Bling-Bling Boy\" Hamilton, a fellow [[wikt:archrival|arch-rival]] of the Test sisters and [[frienemy]] of Johnny and Dukey, who has an unrequited [[Puppy love|crush]] on Susan. Another is Sissy Blakely, a tomboy who often serves as Johnny's rival/friend; the two are believed to have crushes on each other, but each would instantly deny it, and they also constantly compete against each other. Missy, Sissy's pink [[labradoodle]], is also Dukey's rival/crush. A third is Bumper, the school bully who constantly picks on Johnny. Meanwhile, the General from the [[army base]] Area 51.1 and Mr. Black and Mr. White, two [[Law enforcement agency|federal agents]] from the Super Secret Government Agency (SSGA), are shown to be close friends with the kids and often get them out of trouble or recruit them for an assignment, or simply help, distract, and/or annoy the Tests on various occasions.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n{{:List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Johnny Test characters}}\n* Johnny Test (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]])\n* Dukey (voiced by [[Louis Chirillo]] in seasons 1\u20134, and by [[Trevor Devall]] in seasons 5\u20136)\n* Susan Test (voiced by [[Maryke Hendrikse]])\n* Mary Test (voiced by Brittney Wilson in seasons 1 and 5, and [[Ashleigh Ball]] in seasons 2\u20134 and 6)\n* Hugh Test (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]])\n* Lila Test (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]])\n* Gil Nexdor (voiced by [[Andrew Francis]])\n* Mr. Black (voiced by [[Bill Mondy]])\n* Mr. White (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]])\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origin and development===\nOn February 16, 2005, [[Kids' WB]]'s unveiling of its new fall schedule for the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u20132006 television season]] was announced by [[The WB|The WB Television Network]], featuring its returning series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

The show premiered on September 17, 2005, on Kids' WB's [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup of its weekly fall schedule, alongside ''Loonatics Unleashed'' and ''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island''. The episode pair \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\" and \"Johnny X\" marked the series premiere.\n\nWhen the show first aired on Kids' WB (season 1 only), it performed very well in the Nielsen ratings. It ranked as the #1 broadcast program in Girl 2-11 (garnering 2.2/10), ranked as the #2 broadcast series in Kids 2-11 (gaining 2.3/11 in the process) and Girls 6-11 (2.4/11), and ultimately ranking #3 in Kids 6-11 (receiving 3.0/14). Its second season received a slightly higher number of viewers on average in the United States: 2.6 million viewers per 2nd-season episode. Its 3rd season's average number of viewers in the United States was 3.1 million viewers. Its 4th season got an average number of about 4.3 million viewers per episode in the United States. Its 5th premiere attracted over 4.7 million viewers in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1111667,00.html|title=Looney Tunes-Inspired \"Loonatics Unleashed\" Remains #1 Broadcast Kids' Series Second Week in a Row Among All Key Demos|date=September 29, 2005|work=Time Warner|accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe series was developed for television by [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]], with a brief, slightly longer pre-existing pilot short produced by Simpson as well, before the show was picked up as a full series by Kids' WB. Based on Episode 1A \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\", the pilot episode was animated roughly in [[Adobe Flash]], but retaining the same plot, used the same color schemes as the aforementioned episode, and was recorded with an American voice cast (retaining [[James Arnold Taylor]] as the voice of Johnny Test) instead. The original production design (including character designs, prop designs and background designs) was created, provided and contributed by [[Matt Danner]] and Marc Perry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072406/http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|url-status=dead|title=Johnny Test Logo|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> and then later worked on by producer [[Chris Savino]] and art director Paul Stec. Fellows, the creator of the series who had interested the network in the series' premise, based the titular character on himself when he was a young boy; he based Johnny's twin sisters, Susan and Mary, on his own two sisters, also named Susan and Mary.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031055714/http://jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|url-status=dead|title=James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test|archivedate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> In the original pilot and early promotional material of the show, Dukey was referred to as \"Poochie\".\n\nJames Arnold Taylor said that he was not Fellows' original choice for the role of Johnny Test; he had previously voiced the lead character in the initial test pilot. After the show got picked up by Kids' WB! as a series, he was initially going to be replaced by a different voice actor, with a Canadian voice cast instead, but the studio had trouble finding Johnny's initial voice convincing for the first six episodes, so they gave Taylor back the role to redub his dialog for the rest of the first season, and managed to keep him on the cast for the rest of the series.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\"/> Aaron Simpson, who had developed the series and produced the pilot, was the creator and executive producer's first choice to serve as the producer of the show, before he turned it down.\n\n===Production===\nThe remainder of the first season was produced in-house by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], but since the show was a U.S./Canada co-production, some of the animation production work was outsourced to Canadian animation studios [[Studio B Productions]] and Top Draw Animation, as well as South Korean animation production company [[Digital eMation]], which also provided the original main title animation opening. Storyboarding of some of the episodes was done by [[Atomic Cartoons]].\n\nMany of the original writers, storyboarders, and art crew of the series' first production season were recycled,{{clarify|date=July 2019|reason=\"recycled\"?}} including familiar [[Cartoon Network Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] alumni, as well as some from WB Animation, [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[DIC Entertainment]], and even the [[comic book industry]], including [[Chris Savino]], Marc Perry, Paul Stec, Matt Danner, Joe Horne, [[Mike Kazaleh]], Brian Larsen, [[Jun Falkenstein]], [[Scott Shaw!]], Nora Johnson, [[Milton Knight]], Ray Leong,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheet by Ray Leong, at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ray_leong/2314964234/|Johnny Test Characters|Flickr - Photo Sharing!]</ref> Chris Battle, Casey Mitchum,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheets by [[Casey Mitchum]], at his blog site [http://kasefase.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html Puppies and Paint: September 2008]</ref> Pat Ventura, [[John Derevlany]], J.C.

The first game, ''Johnny Test: Clone Zapper'', finds Johnny Test and Dukey engaged to combat an army of Johnny clones they accidentally created  from a clone machine, with the help of two special laser zapper guns as their only weapons to defeat the clones and destroy them personally, and the second game, ''Johnny Test: Bot Drop'', sees Johnny, Dukey and the Test twins going on a rescue chase, with Johnny and Dukey both piloting a bot drop plane to use the robot clones of Johnnies (first seen in ''[[List of Johnny Test episodes#101 Johnnies|101 Johnnies]]'') for the titular \"Bot Drops\" to eject them to safety in a moving rescue vehicle driven by Susan and Mary. In the plot of that latter aforementioned game, and like in each level of the game before it, Johnny has to aim and time to drop the robots so they will land safely onto the vehicle, then Johnny Test has saved the day once again. Both games are typical shoot-slinging and side-scrolling games that in all utilize the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad's unique multi-touch capabilities and scrolling, and, as a whole, players of both games can compete on the worldwide high scores list of each level of the game and competitive players.

The Test Twins frequently use Johnny as a [[Human experimentation|guinea pig]] for their various experiments and inventions in their laboratory filled with highly advanced technology built in over the Tests' household attic, with most of which they try to impress their pretty boy next-door neighbor, Gil, for whom both harbor a deep love and obsession, although their attempts to come up with some way to attract his attention usually end in failure.\n\nJohnny is a troublesome and mischievous boy who causes problems in the family and often within the city. His best friend is his [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking pet dog, Dukey, who Susan and Mary gave human-level intelligence and the ability to speak in an experiment. Because Johnny has Susan, Mary and Dukey by his side, he can live any kid's dream, only to find that most dreams never turn out as hoped. He is very hyperactive and often messes with his sisters' inventions, causing trouble and mayhem, but just as often proves himself to be clever such as by frequently tricking his sisters or saving the day from whatever danger happens to show up. Johnny is also stubborn and a bit spoiled, as he gets what he wants through deceit, blackmail, or manipulation. However, he does have a sense of justice and always learns from his mistakes. However, he, like most kids, does not like school; if anything, he goes to great lengths to avoid doing work, often using his sisters' inventions to do so and often putting himself and/or others in trouble as a result.\n\nOne of Johnny's main nemeses is Eugene \"Bling-Bling Boy\" Hamilton, a fellow [[wikt:archrival|arch-rival]] of the Test sisters and [[frienemy]] of Johnny and Dukey, who has an unrequited [[Puppy love|crush]] on Susan. Another is Sissy Blakely, a tomboy who often serves as Johnny's rival/friend; the two are believed to have crushes on each other, but each would instantly deny it, and they also constantly compete against each other. Missy, Sissy's pink [[labradoodle]], is also Dukey's rival/crush. A third is Bumper, the school bully who constantly picks on Johnny. Meanwhile, the General from the [[army base]] Area 51.1 and Mr. Black and Mr. White, two [[Law enforcement agency|federal agents]] from the Super Secret Government Agency (SSGA), are shown to be close friends with the kids and often get them out of trouble or recruit them for an assignment, or simply help, distract, and/or annoy the Tests on various occasions.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n{{:List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Johnny Test characters}}\n* Johnny Test (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]])\n* Dukey (voiced by [[Louis Chirillo]] in seasons 1\u20134, and by [[Trevor Devall]] in seasons 5\u20136)\n* Susan Test (voiced by [[Maryke Hendrikse]])\n* Mary Test (voiced by Brittney Wilson in seasons 1 and 5, and [[Ashleigh Ball]] in seasons 2\u20134 and 6)\n* Hugh Test (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]])\n* Lila Test (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]])\n* Gil Nexdor (voiced by [[Andrew Francis]])\n* Mr. Black (voiced by [[Bill Mondy]])\n* Mr. White (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]])\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origin and development===\nOn February 16, 2005, [[Kids' WB]]'s unveiling of its new fall schedule for the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u20132006 television season]] was announced by [[The WB|The WB Television Network]], featuring its returning series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'', ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', and ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'', alongside four new series: ''[[Loonatics Unleashed]]'', ''[[Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island]]'', ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', and ''Johnny Test''. The aforementioned schedule was announced by The WB/Kids' WB Entertainment President David Janollari, Kids' WB Senior Vice President and General Manager Betsy McGowen, speaking to advertisers and the media press during the Kids' WB [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] sales presentation in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.felixthecat.com/fan-pdfs/KWB%2005-06Upfront%20ann%20FINAL.DOC|title=Kids' WB! Upfront 2005\u20132006 Announcement}}</ref> ''Johnny Test'' was created and executively produced by [[Scott Fellows]], who created the [[Nickelodeon]] [[Live action|live-action]] series ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]],'' ''[[Big Time Rush]]'', and [[100 Things to Do Before High School|100 ''Things to Do Before High School'']]; Fellows had also served as the head writer for ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' and ''[[ChalkZone]]''. The show premiered on September 17, 2005, on Kids' WB's [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup of its weekly fall schedule, alongside ''Loonatics Unleashed'' and ''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island''. The episode pair \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\" and \"Johnny X\" marked the series premiere.\n\nWhen the show first aired on Kids' WB (season 1 only), it performed very well in the Nielsen ratings. It ranked as the #1 broadcast program in Girl 2-11 (garnering 2.2/10), ranked as the #2 broadcast series in Kids 2-11 (gaining 2.3/11 in the process) and Girls 6-11 (2.4/11), and ultimately ranking #3 in Kids 6-11 (receiving 3.0/14). Its second season received a slightly higher number of viewers on average in the United States: 2.6 million viewers per 2nd-season episode. Its 3rd season's average number of viewers in the United States was 3.1 million viewers. Its 4th season got an average number of about 4.3 million viewers per episode in the United States. Its 5th premiere attracted over 4.7 million viewers in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1111667,00.html|title=Looney Tunes-Inspired \"Loonatics Unleashed\" Remains #1 Broadcast Kids' Series Second Week in a Row Among All Key Demos|date=September 29, 2005|work=Time Warner|accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe series was developed for television by [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]], with a brief, slightly longer pre-existing pilot short produced by Simpson as well, before the show was picked up as a full series by Kids' WB. Based on Episode 1A \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\", the pilot episode was animated roughly in [[Adobe Flash]], but retaining the same plot, used the same color schemes as the aforementioned episode, and was recorded with an American voice cast (retaining [[James Arnold Taylor]] as the voice of Johnny Test) instead. The original production design (including character designs, prop designs and background designs) was created, provided and contributed by [[Matt Danner]] and Marc Perry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072406/http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|url-status=dead|title=Johnny Test Logo|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> and then later worked on by producer [[Chris Savino]] and art director Paul Stec. Fellows, the creator of the series who had interested the network in the series' premise, based the titular character on himself when he was a young boy; he based Johnny's twin sisters, Susan and Mary, on his own two sisters, also named Susan and Mary.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031055714/http://jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|url-status=dead|title=James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test|archivedate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> In the original pilot and early promotional material of the show, Dukey was referred to as \"Poochie\".\n\nJames Arnold Taylor said that he was not Fellows' original choice for the role of Johnny Test; he had previously voiced the lead character in the initial test pilot. After the show got picked up by Kids' WB! as a series, he was initially going to be replaced by a different voice actor, with a Canadian voice cast instead, but the studio had trouble finding Johnny's initial voice convincing for the first six episodes, so they gave Taylor back the role to redub his dialog for the rest of the first season, and managed to keep him on the cast for the rest of the series.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\"/> Aaron Simpson, who had developed the series and produced the pilot, was the creator and executive producer's first choice to serve as the producer of the show, before he turned it down.\n\n===Production===\nThe remainder of the first season was produced in-house by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], but since the show was a U.S./Canada co-production, some of the animation production work was outsourced to Canadian animation studios [[Studio B Productions]] and Top Draw Animation, as well as South Korean animation production company [[Digital eMation]], which also provided the original main title animation opening. Storyboarding of some of the episodes was done by [[Atomic Cartoons]].\n\nMany of the original writers, storyboarders, and art crew of the series' first production season were recycled,{{clarify|date=July 2019|reason=\"recycled\"?}} including familiar [[Cartoon Network Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] alumni, as well as some from WB Animation, [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[DIC Entertainment]], and even the [[comic book industry]], including [[Chris Savino]], Marc Perry, Paul Stec, Matt Danner, Joe Horne, [[Mike Kazaleh]], Brian Larsen, [[Jun Falkenstein]], [[Scott Shaw!]], Nora Johnson, [[Milton Knight]], Ray Leong,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheet by Ray Leong, at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ray_leong/2314964234/|Johnny Test Characters|Flickr - Photo Sharing!]</ref> Chris Battle, Casey Mitchum,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheets by [[Casey Mitchum]], at his blog site [http://kasefase.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html Puppies and Paint: September 2008]</ref> Pat Ventura, [[John Derevlany]], J.C.

Starting with the fifth season, Trevor Devall would become the new voice of Dukey, due to Louis Chirillo leaving the series. Similarly, Ashleigh Ball retired as the voice of Mary, Sissy and Missy at the end of the 4th season, due to her work on ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''; as a result, she was replaced by Brittney Wilson, Mary's original voice.\n\nOn March 12, 2012, it was announced that the show had been renewed for a sixth season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecookiejarcompany.com/press/cj_press_20120320.php|title=COOKIE JAR ENTERTAINMENT FEATURES NEW SEASON OF JOHNNY TEST, MUDPIT, AND TOP PERFORMING LIBRARY TITLES AT MIPTV|date=March 12, 2012|publisher=Cookie Jar Group|accessdate=2012-11-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214006/http://www.thecookiejarcompany.com/press/cj_press_20120320.php|archivedate=October 4, 2013}}</ref> Like the fourth and fifth season before it, it would again be a full set of 26 episodes; the renewal brought the series total to 117 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecookiejarcompany.com/press/cj_press_20120413.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195015/http://www.thecookiejarcompany.com/press/cj_press_20120413.php |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref> Ashleigh Ball also returned for the roles in this season.

The first game, ''Johnny Test: Clone Zapper'', finds Johnny Test and Dukey engaged to combat an army of Johnny clones they accidentally created  from a clone machine, with the help of two special laser zapper guns as their only weapons to defeat the clones and destroy them personally, and the second game, ''Johnny Test: Bot Drop'', sees Johnny, Dukey and the Test twins going on a rescue chase, with Johnny and Dukey both piloting a bot drop plane to use the robot clones of Johnnies (first seen in ''[[List of Johnny Test episodes#101 Johnnies|101 Johnnies]]'') for the titular \"Bot Drops\" to eject them to safety in a moving rescue vehicle driven by Susan and Mary. In the plot of that latter aforementioned game, and like in each level of the game before it, Johnny has to aim and time to drop the robots so they will land safely onto the vehicle, then Johnny Test has saved the day once again. Both games are typical shoot-slinging and side-scrolling games that in all utilize the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad's unique multi-touch capabilities and scrolling, and, as a whole, players of both games can compete on the worldwide high scores list of each level of the game and competitive players. Later in Spring of 2011, the series was finally officially licensed by [[Cookie Jar (company)|Cookie Jar]] for a new third, and fully console-handled video game, this time, however, to come out on [[Nintendo DS]]; a sneak preview and trailer of the game had been already included on the complete first and second seasons DVD set (as aforementioned above), and was released in March 29, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecookiejarcompany.com/press/cj_press_20100120.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202144757/http://thecookiejarcompany.com/press/cj_press_20100120.php|url-status=dead|title=COOKIE JAR ENTERTAINMENT AND JIRBO TEAM UP TO RELEASE NEW JOHNNY TEST GAMES FOR IPHONE AND IPOD TOUCH|archivedate=December 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidscreen.com/2010/01/21/cookiejar-20100121/ |title= KidScreen -
