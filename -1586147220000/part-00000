As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including [[E3 2020]], were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://time.com/5793862/coronavirus-video-games/ | title = 'This Is Quite a Blow.'

Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story takes place in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020.\n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and acting.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Summary==\nAround 2058, Delos Inc. operates one of several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by \"hosts\": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.\n\nIn the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new \"Reverie\" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the \"Man in Black\", William Delos tries to find \"the maze\" he believes Dr. Ford left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host-based Arnold, killed in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, whom they both wanted to see become sentient, from being abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him. \n\nDolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her \"daughter\" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with the cores of several other hosts, including Bernard's. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.\n\nWithin the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body and others, including Bernard's and at least 2 other hosts. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human to the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what are Dolores's plans.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n\n<!-- Per WP:TVCAST: The cast listing should be ordered according to the original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. -->\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy, the oldest host still working in the park.

film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" />\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" /><ref name=\"Fehrman\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name=\"Fehrman\" />\n\nThe [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.<ref name=\"christina\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.<ref name=\"nudity rules\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at [[Paramount Ranch]] were destroyed by the [[Woolsey Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |title=The set of 'Westworld' has been destroyed in a major fire |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=November 11, 2018 |website=[[NME]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025819/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Paramount_Ranch_-_Post-Woolsey_Fire.jpeg|600px|The Paramount Ranch following the Woolsey Fire and undergoing rebuilding in May 2019.

He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /><ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name=\"paranoid black paint\" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&mdash;\"a primitive form of robot\"&mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Bj\u00f6rk]] song \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"conceptualize\" />\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse, now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores).

Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story takes place in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020.\n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and acting.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Summary==\nAround 2058, Delos Inc. operates one of several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by \"hosts\": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.\n\nIn the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new \"Reverie\" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the \"Man in Black\", William Delos tries to find \"the maze\" he believes Dr. Ford left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host-based Arnold, killed in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, whom they both wanted to see become sentient, from being abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him. \n\nDolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her \"daughter\" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with the cores of several other hosts, including Bernard's. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.\n\nWithin the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body and others, including Bernard's and at least 2 other hosts. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human to the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what are Dolores's plans.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n\n<!-- Per WP:TVCAST: The cast listing should be ordered according to the original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. -->\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy, the oldest host still working in the park.

film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" />\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" /><ref name=\"Fehrman\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name=\"Fehrman\" />\n\nThe [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.<ref name=\"christina\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.<ref name=\"nudity rules\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at [[Paramount Ranch]] were destroyed by the [[Woolsey Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |title=The set of 'Westworld' has been destroyed in a major fire |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=November 11, 2018 |website=[[NME]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025819/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Paramount_Ranch_-_Post-Woolsey_Fire.jpeg|600px|The Paramount Ranch following the Woolsey Fire and undergoing rebuilding in May 2019.

He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /><ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name=\"paranoid black paint\" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&mdash;\"a primitive form of robot\"&mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Bj\u00f6rk]] song \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"conceptualize\" />\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse, now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores).
