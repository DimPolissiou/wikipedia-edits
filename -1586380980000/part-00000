The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time.

In March 2015, the CDC interviewed the survivors; they all reported having had at least one adverse symptom during their recovery period. The symptoms ranged from mild (e.g. hair loss) to more severe complications requiring re-hospitalisation or treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms were lethargy or fatigue, joint pain, and hair loss. Sixty-three per cent reported having eye problems including two who were diagnosed with uveitis, 75% reported psychological or cognitive symptoms, and 38% reported neural difficulties. Although most symptoms resolved or improved over time, only one survivor reported complete resolution of all symptoms.<ref name=\"New England Journal of Medicine\">{{cite journal| title=Post-Ebola Signs and Symptoms in U.S. Survivors | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=17 December 2015 | doi=10.1056/NEJMc1506576 | pmid=26672870 | volume=373 | issue=25 | pages=2484\u20132486|last1 = Epstein|first1 = Lauren| last2=Wong | first2=Karen K | last3=Kallen | first3=Alexander J | last4=Uyeki | first4=Timothy M }}</ref>\n\nA study published in May 2015 discussed the case of Ian Crozier, a Zimbabwe-born physician and American citizen who became infected with Ebola while he was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

However, after discharge Crozier began to experience symptoms including low back pain, bilateral [[enthesitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], [[paresthesias]] involving his lower legs, and eye pain, which was diagnosed as uveitis.  His eye condition worsened and a specimen of [[aqueous humor]] obtained from his eye tested positive for Ebola.

In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name=\"auto2\" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/10/05/jech-2015-205959.full|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271\u2013277|author=Jeremy Bowles|accessdate=27 January 2016|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive\u2014water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]]. This, the report states, showed the risks in having such consequential decision-making power in one individual\u2014a risk made worse when there was no mechanism of responsibility for such leadership failure.<ref name=\"lancet\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00946-0/abstract|title=Will Ebola change the game?

Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment.

The pain is symmetrical and more pronounced in the morning, with the larger joints most affected. There is also possible periarticular [[tenosynovitis]] affecting the shoulders. The WHO guidelines advise to distinguish non-inflammatory [[arthralgia]] from inflammatory [[arthritis]]. With regard to ocular problems, sensitivity to light and blurry vision have been indicated among survivors. Among the aftereffects of Ebola virus disease, uveitis and optic nerve disease could appear after an individual is discharged. Ocular problems could threaten sight in survivors, thus the need for prompt treatment. In treating such individuals, the WHO recommends urgent intervention if uveitis is suspected; this consists mainly of prednisone (a [[corticosteroid]]). Hearing loss has been reported in Ebola survivors 25% of the time.

In March 2015, the CDC interviewed the survivors; they all reported having had at least one adverse symptom during their recovery period. The symptoms ranged from mild (e.g. hair loss) to more severe complications requiring re-hospitalisation or treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms were lethargy or fatigue, joint pain, and hair loss. Sixty-three per cent reported having eye problems including two who were diagnosed with uveitis, 75% reported psychological or cognitive symptoms, and 38% reported neural difficulties. Although most symptoms resolved or improved over time, only one survivor reported complete resolution of all symptoms.<ref name=\"New England Journal of Medicine\">{{cite journal| title=Post-Ebola Signs and Symptoms in U.S. Survivors | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=17 December 2015 | doi=10.1056/NEJMc1506576 | pmid=26672870 | volume=373 | issue=25 | pages=2484\u20132486|last1 = Epstein|first1 = Lauren| last2=Wong | first2=Karen K | last3=Kallen | first3=Alexander J | last4=Uyeki | first4=Timothy M }}</ref>\n\nA study published in May 2015 discussed the case of Ian Crozier, a Zimbabwe-born physician and American citizen who became infected with Ebola while he was working at an Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone.

However, after discharge Crozier began to experience symptoms including low back pain, bilateral [[enthesitis]] of the [[Achilles tendon]], [[paresthesias]] involving his lower legs, and eye pain, which was diagnosed as uveitis.  His eye condition worsened and a specimen of [[aqueous humor]] obtained from his eye tested positive for Ebola.

In March 2015, the United Nations Development Group reported that due to a decrease in trade, closing of borders, flight cancellations, and drop in foreign investment and tourism activity fuelled by stigma, the epidemic resulted in vast economic consequences both in the affected areas and throughout Africa.<ref name=\"auto2\" />  A September 2014 report in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' suggested that the economic impact of the Ebola outbreak could kill more people than the disease itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiannews.net/index.php/sid/225466201|publisher=Australian News.Net|title=IMF says Ebola impacted West African nations may need economic assistance}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to Ebola and economic activity in the country of Liberia, a study found that 8% of automotive firms, 8% of construction firms, 15% of food businesses and 30% of restaurants had closed due to the Ebola outbreak. Montserrado county experienced up to 20% firm closure. This indicated a decline in the Liberian national economy during the outbreak, as well as an indication that the county of Montserrado was hardest hit economically. The capital city Monrovia suffered construction and restaurant unemployment the most, while outside the capital, the food and beverage sectors suffered economically. A recuperation in the economy, at the end of the outbreak, was expected to be more rapid in some sectors than in others. Also, if the massive decline in economic activity persisted, the authors suggested a focus on economic recovery in addition to support for the healthcare system. The [[World Bank]] had projected an estimated loss of $1.6 billion in productivity for all three affected Western African countries combined for 2015. In Liberian counties that were less affected by the outbreak, the number of individuals employed fell by 24%. Montserrado saw a 47% decline in employment per firm in contrast to what was obtained prior to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2015/10/05/jech-2015-205959.full|title=Ebola, jobs and economic activity in Liberia|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=70|issue=3|pages=271\u2013277|author=Jeremy Bowles|accessdate=27 January 2016|doi=10.1136/jech-2015-205959|pmid=26438188|pmc=4789821|year=2016}}</ref>\n\nAnother study showed that the economic effect of the Ebola outbreak would be felt for years due to preexisting [[social vulnerability]]. The economic effects were being felt nationwide in Liberia, such as the termination of expansions in the mining business.

In spite of the end of civil violence since 2003 and inflows from international donors, the reconstruction of Liberia had been very slow and non-productive\u2014water delivery systems, sanitation facilities and centralised electricity were practically non-existent, even in Monrovia. Even before the outbreak, medical facilities did not have potable water, lighting or refrigeration.

Their recommendations were published in the November issue of ''[[The Lancet]]''.  According to the panel, the epidemic had exposed problems in the national (and international) institutions responsible for protecting the public from the human consequences of infectious disease outbreaks such as the Ebola epidemic.  The panel was highly critical of the WHO's management of the Ebola crisis noting that it took them months to respond and when they did they were slow to act, poorly co-ordinated and inadequately informed.  The report pointed out that the committee responsible for checking the WHO's actions during the outbreak (i.e. the WHO Ebola Interim Assessment Panel) had delayed responses due to worries about political resistance from the Western African leaders, economic consequences, and a system within the WHO that discouraged open debate about issues such as emergency declarations. The WHO may also have hesitated because it was criticised for creating panic by declaring a public health emergency during the relatively mild [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]]. This, the report states, showed the risks in having such consequential decision-making power in one individual\u2014a risk made worse when there was no mechanism of responsibility for such leadership failure.<ref name=\"lancet\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)00946-0/abstract|title=Will Ebola change the game?

Included in the recommendations of the changes needed to fight future outbreaks is the creation of a U.N. Security Council health committee to expedite political attention to health issues and the establishment of a global fund to finance and accelerate the development of outbreak-relevant drugs and treatment.  The report also noted that competent governance of the global system demanded political leadership and a WHO that is more focused and appropriately financed and whose integrity is restored through the application of adequate reforms and leadership.<ref name=\"lancet\"/>\n\nThe WHO also came under fire for refusing to send Dr. Olivet Buck to Germany for experimental treatment after she contracted Ebola per the government of Sierra Leone's request. WHO claimed they could only evacuate medical professionals they had deployed to the region, not locals. Dr. Olivet Buck was the Medical Superintendent at Lumley Government Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It's believed that she contracted the virus while continuing to treat patients even during a shortage of personal protective equipment.

The inaugural event, covered by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], featured all Canadian performers. The festival grew in popularity, size and rowdiness until the popularity of the 1963 festival (with over 8,000 advance tickets sold), and the lack of sufficient security, led to a backlash from town locals.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Guitars, Goatees and Girls -- Famous Folk and Folksong Fans Flock for Festival Fun and Frolic for Third Time TO Mariposa|last=Marshall|first=Bill|date=1963-08-10|work=Toronto Daily Star|last2=Taylor|first2=Gil|page=19|id = {{ProQuest|1427335494}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=17,000 Paid To Enjoy Mariposa Show|last=Marshall|first=Bill|date=1963-08-12|last2=Taylor|first2=Gil|page=16|id = {{ProQuest|1427336416}}}}</ref> The city of Orillia secured a court injunction to prevent the festival from continuing in the town limits.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Curious Ethics [letter to the editor]|last=Pape|first=P.

In 2000, the Mariposa Folk Festival was invited back to Orillia by city councilors Tim Lauer and Don Evans. The festival continues to be held in Orillia.

The festival grew in popularity, size and rowdiness until the popularity of the 1963 festival (with over 8,000 advance tickets sold), and the lack of sufficient security, led to a backlash from town locals.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Guitars, Goatees and Girls -- Famous Folk and Folksong Fans Flock for Festival Fun and Frolic for Third Time TO Mariposa|last=Marshall|first=Bill|date=1963-08-10|work=Toronto Daily Star|last2=Taylor|first2=Gil|page=19|id = {{ProQuest|1427335494}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=17,000 Paid To Enjoy Mariposa Show|last=Marshall|first=Bill|date=1963-08-12|last2=Taylor|first2=Gil|page=16|id = {{ProQuest|1427336416}}}}</ref> The city of Orillia secured a court injunction to prevent the festival from continuing in the town limits.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Curious Ethics [letter to the editor]|last=Pape|first=P.

She lost by 1,000 votes.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nIn 1995, Stuart was selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for the [[Birmingham Edgbaston (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Edgbaston]] constituency. The constituency, which had once been held by former Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] (1937\u201340), had returned only [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs for 99 years. The sitting Conservative MP at the time, Dame [[Jill Knight]], was retiring after 31 years. On [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1 May 1997]], Stuart was elected as the first-ever Labour MP for the constituency, making it one of a succession of traditional Conservative seats to fall to Labour control in a landslide victory for the party. Stuart's victory was the first televised Labour gain of the evening.\n\nDuring the first [[Tony Blair]] ministry, Stuart served on the Social Security Select Committee and in 1998 as PPS to [[Home Office]] Minister of State [[Paul Boateng]], before joining the government in 1999 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health.

In this capacity, Stuart also served as one of the thirteen members of the Convention's Presidium - the steering group responsible for managing the business of the Convention.\n\nWhen the draft Constitution emerged, Stuart was one of the most trenchant critics of the proposal, stating that it had been drawn up by a \"self-selected group of the European political elite\" determined to deepen European integration. She subsequently expounded these views in a 2004 [[Fabian Society]] pamphlet, ''The Making of Europe's Constitution''. Consequently, she has argued in favour of British withdrawal from the European Union, becoming one of the leading [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] figures in the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labour MP Gisela Stuart: UK should leave European Union|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20124699|website = BBC News|access-date = 14 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160111201703/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20124699|archive-date = 11 January 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> In the BBC's two-hour televised debate on the EU referendum, Stuart appeared on the \"Leave\" panel, along with the Conservative MPs [[Andrea Leadsom]] and [[Boris Johnson]].<ref>{{cite news|title=EU referendum: Leave and Remain clash in BBC Great Debate|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36582567|accessdate=1 April 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=22 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204034134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36582567|archive-date=4 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, she became the only Labour MP who openly supported the re-election of [[George W.

The constituency, which had once been held by former Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] (1937\u201340), had returned only [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs for 99 years. The sitting Conservative MP at the time, Dame [[Jill Knight]], was retiring after 31 years. On [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1 May 1997]], Stuart was elected as the first-ever Labour MP for the constituency, making it one of a succession of traditional Conservative seats to fall to Labour control in a landslide victory for the party. Stuart's victory was the first televised Labour gain of the evening.\n\nDuring the first [[Tony Blair]] ministry, Stuart served on the Social Security Select Committee and in 1998 as PPS to [[Home Office]] Minister of State [[Paul Boateng]], before joining the government in 1999 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health.

In this capacity, Stuart also served as one of the thirteen members of the Convention's Presidium - the steering group responsible for managing the business of the Convention.\n\nWhen the draft Constitution emerged, Stuart was one of the most trenchant critics of the proposal, stating that it had been drawn up by a \"self-selected group of the European political elite\" determined to deepen European integration. She subsequently expounded these views in a 2004 [[Fabian Society]] pamphlet, ''The Making of Europe's Constitution''. Consequently, she has argued in favour of British withdrawal from the European Union, becoming one of the leading [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Eurosceptic]] figures in the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labour MP Gisela Stuart: UK should leave European Union|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20124699|website = BBC News|access-date = 14 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160111201703/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20124699|archive-date = 11 January 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> In the BBC's two-hour televised debate on the EU referendum, Stuart appeared on the \"Leave\" panel, along with the Conservative MPs [[Andrea Leadsom]] and [[Boris Johnson]].<ref>{{cite news|title=EU referendum: Leave and Remain clash in BBC Great Debate|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36582567|accessdate=1 April 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=22 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204034134/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36582567|archive-date=4 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2004, she became the only Labour MP who openly supported the re-election of [[George W.

Some routes are for local transport within the city; others bring passengers from surrounding areas to stops on the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] or [[MBTA Subway|subway]] lines. The MBTA has a policy objective to provide transit service within walking distance (defined as {{convert|0.25|mi|km}}) for all residents living in areas with population densities greater than {{convert|5000|PD/sqmi|/km2}} within the MBTA's service district. Much of this service is provided by bus.\n\nThe MBTA operates a four-route [[bus rapid transit]] service branded as the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], as well as [[MBTA crosstown bus routes|three crosstown routes]] that were intended to become the first part of the now-suspended [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring]] project. Fifteen routes designed as [[List of key MBTA bus routes|key routes]] run with higher frequency at all times, including extended service hours on Friday and Saturday nights over some of these routes.\n\nMost MBTA Bus service is served by [[Diesel engine|diesel]], [[compressed natural gas]], and [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric hybrid]] buses. Silver Line routes running in the Waterfront Tunnel use [[dual-mode bus|dual-mode]] buses that operate as [[trolleybuses]] in the tunnel and as diesel buses on the surface. [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston#Harvard-based routes|Four routes]] based out of the [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]] run with trolleybuses in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and several surrounding suburbs.\n\nAll buses and routes are wheelchair-accessible (see [[MBTA accessibility]]); most of the MBTA's bus fleet consists of [[low-floor bus]]es with wheelchair ramps, while older high-floor buses have lifts. All buses have [[LED]] exterior [[Destination sign|headsigns]] displaying route and destination, with automated audio/visual stop announcements for passengers.\n\nAfter taking over operations in August 1964 from the former Metropolitan Transit Authority, the MBTA began rebranding many elements of Boston's public transportation network. After being found unsuitable in 1965 for what is now the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] because it did not show up well on maps, yellow was chosen for the color of bus operations on January 8, 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/boston/downtown/gallery/orange_line_111th_anniversary?pg=11 |title=MBTA Orange Line's 111th anniversary |newspaper=Boston Globe |last=Tran |first=Andrew Ba |date=June 2012 |page=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721150920/http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/boston/downtown/gallery/orange_line_111th_anniversary?pg=11 |archivedate=July 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=chronicle>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/chronicleofbosto00mass |title=A Chronicle of the Boston Transit System |year=1981 |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |via=Internet Archive |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Boston Elevated Railway]] and MTA operated overnight [[Night service (public transport)|Owl service]] until 1960.

The five routes are primarily commuter routes which connect with other MBTA services at their inbound terminals.

Some routes are for local transport within the city; others bring passengers from surrounding areas to stops on the [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] or [[MBTA Subway|subway]] lines. The MBTA has a policy objective to provide transit service within walking distance (defined as {{convert|0.25|mi|km}}) for all residents living in areas with population densities greater than {{convert|5000|PD/sqmi|/km2}} within the MBTA's service district. Much of this service is provided by bus.\n\nThe MBTA operates a four-route [[bus rapid transit]] service branded as the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], as well as [[MBTA crosstown bus routes|three crosstown routes]] that were intended to become the first part of the now-suspended [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring]] project. Fifteen routes designed as [[List of key MBTA bus routes|key routes]] run with higher frequency at all times, including extended service hours on Friday and Saturday nights over some of these routes.\n\nMost MBTA Bus service is served by [[Diesel engine|diesel]], [[compressed natural gas]], and [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric hybrid]] buses. Silver Line routes running in the Waterfront Tunnel use [[dual-mode bus|dual-mode]] buses that operate as [[trolleybuses]] in the tunnel and as diesel buses on the surface. [[Trolleybuses in Greater Boston#Harvard-based routes|Four routes]] based out of the [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]] run with trolleybuses in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and several surrounding suburbs.\n\nAll buses and routes are wheelchair-accessible (see [[MBTA accessibility]]); most of the MBTA's bus fleet consists of [[low-floor bus]]es with wheelchair ramps, while older high-floor buses have lifts. All buses have [[LED]] exterior [[Destination sign|headsigns]] displaying route and destination, with automated audio/visual stop announcements for passengers.\n\nAfter taking over operations in August 1964 from the former Metropolitan Transit Authority, the MBTA began rebranding many elements of Boston's public transportation network. After being found unsuitable in 1965 for what is now the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] because it did not show up well on maps, yellow was chosen for the color of bus operations on January 8, 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/boston/downtown/gallery/orange_line_111th_anniversary?pg=11 |title=MBTA Orange Line's 111th anniversary |newspaper=Boston Globe |last=Tran |first=Andrew Ba |date=June 2012 |page=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721150920/http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/boston/downtown/gallery/orange_line_111th_anniversary?pg=11 |archivedate=July 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=chronicle>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/chronicleofbosto00mass |title=A Chronicle of the Boston Transit System |year=1981 |publisher=Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |via=Internet Archive |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Boston Elevated Railway]] and MTA operated overnight [[Night service (public transport)|Owl service]] until 1960.
