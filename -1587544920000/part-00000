The company then became '''RCA Victor'''. In absorbing Victor, RCA acquired the [[New World]] rights to the famous [[Nipper]]/\"[[His Master's Voice]]\" [[trademark]].\nIn 1931, RCA Victor's British affiliate the [[Gramophone Company]] merged with the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]] to form [[EMI]]. This gave RCA head [[David Sarnoff]] a seat on the EMI board.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanjek |first1=Russell |title=American Popular Music and Its Business: The First Four Hundred Years ... |date=July 28, 1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=9780195043112 |page=118 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EzVesnkLEtUC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=%22david+sarnoff%22%2B+emi+%2B+board#v=onepage&q=%22david%20sarnoff%22%2B%20emi%20%2B%20board&f=false |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1931, RCA Victor introduced the first 33\u2153 rpm records sold to the public, calling them \"Program Transcriptions\". These used a shallower and more closely spaced implementation of the large \"standard groove\" found on contemporary 78 rpm records, rather than the \"microgroove\" used for post-World War II 33\u2153 rpm \"[[LP record|LP]]\" (long play) records. The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. The format was abandoned by 1933, and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edward |first1=David |title=RCA Program Transcription Album Discography (1931\u201333) |url=http://bsnpubs.com/rca/rca/rca33.html |website=bsnpubs.com |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early part of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful cheap label to compete with the \"dime store labels\" ([[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], etc.). The first was the short-lived \"Timely Tunes\" label in 1931 sold at Montgomery Ward. [[Bluebird Records]] was created in 1932 as a sub-label of RCA Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside an 8-inch Electradisk label (sold at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s). Neither were a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird's label was redesigned, and it became known as the 'buff' label). Another cheap label, Sunrise, was produced (although nobody seems to know for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label still survives today, eight decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued. RCA Victor also produced records for [[Montgomery Ward]] label during the 1930s.\n\nBesides manufacturing records for themselves, RCA Victor operated RCA Custom which was the leading record manufacturer for [[independent record label]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quality Go Together at RCA Records |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22rca+custom%22%2B+leading#v=onepage&q=%22rca%20custom%22%2B%20leading&f=false |website=via Google |publisher=Billboard (archived ad) |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |date=October 6, 1958}}</ref> RCA Custom also pressed many record compilations for [[The Reader's Digest Association]].\n\nRCA sold its interest in EMI in 1935, but EMI continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] label until the late 1950s. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and custom HMV labels in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |title=RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (19501976) |first=Ron |last=Penndorf |work=RECOLLECTIONS: Fine Vintage LPs and Journal of Recorded Music |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111011131/http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===World War II era===\nDuring World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese affiliate [[JVC]] were severed. JVC's record company is known today as [[Victor Entertainment]] and still retains the [[Nipper]]/[[His Master's Voice]] trademark for use in Japan.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|recording ban]]. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. However, RCA Victor lost the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] during this period; the orchestra's contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when [[Columbia Records]] settled with the union before RCA, [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968.\n\n===The post-war 1940s===\n[[File:Down Yonder.jpg|thumb|right|Standard RCA Victor 78 RPM label design from just after the end of [[World War II]] until 1954]]\nIn the spring of 1946, \"RCA Victor\" replaced \"Victor\" on labels for shellac 78 rpm singles. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] micro-grooved [[vinylite]] record, marketed simply as the \"45\". The new format, which had been under development for several years, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs.<ref>Carson, B.H. et al. (1949) [http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/speed45.html \"A Record Changer and Record of Complementary Design\"], ''RCA Review'', June 1949, as reprinted by the Audio Engineering Society (retrieved January 5, 2013)</ref> By the time RCA Victor belatedly unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33\u2153&nbsp;rpm microgroove vinyl \"[[LP record|LP]]\" (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival [[Columbia Records]] in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor's 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-XXXX series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on \"midnight blue\" vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children's fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was \"PeeWee the Piccolo\" RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant Indianapolis, R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001</ref> The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty [[shellac]] compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dawson, Jim and |first1=Propes, Steve |title=45 Rpm: The History, Heroes and Villains of a Pop Music Revolution |date=October 1, 2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0879307579 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AiA-6xfdqC0C&pg=PA24&dq=rca+45+rpm+record+player+1949#v=onepage&q=rca%2045%20rpm%20record%20player%201949&f=false |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78&nbsp;rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some \"[[extended play]]\" (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for some vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] disc featuring [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Marche Slave]]'' and [[Ket\u00e8lbey]]'s ''[[In a Persian Market]]''. Boxed sets of four to six 45s were issued, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP. (An extreme case of these boxed sets was the complete recording of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'', conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]], which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs.) In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another was started up. These disruptive \"side breaks\", a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78&nbsp;rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor's 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor's massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia's LP prevailed as the format for classical music and convenient one-disc \"album\" collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950.\n\n===The 1950s===\nFinally acknowledging the success of Columbia's LP format and fearful of losing further market share, RCA Victor began issuing LPs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html |title=LPs historic |first=Edward |last=Wallerstein |publisher=Musicinthemail.com |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11 |title=Diskery Goes 33 in March To Service Entire Market; 45 Promotion in High Gear |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 7, 1950 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was a performance of ''[[Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]], played by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], which had actually been recorded in [[Boston]]'s [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] on June 20, 1947; it was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical albums were issued with the prefix \"LPM\". When RCA Victor later issued classical stereo albums (in 1958), they used the prefix \"LSC\". Non-classical stereo albums were issued with the prefix \"LSP\". RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973.\n\nIn the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: [[Groove Records|Groove]], [[Vik Recordings|Vik]] and \"X\".\n\nThe edition of ''Billboard'' magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label \u201cX\u201d; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label \"X\" on April 20, 1953. Groove was an [[R&B]] specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/labelX.html |title=Label \"X\" |year=2005 |first=JC |last=Marion |journal=Jamm Upp |volume=2 |issue=36}}</ref> the Vik label was discontinued the following year.\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in intense competition with [[Columbia Records]]. A number of recordings were made with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of [[acoustic recording]]s, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the [[Symphony of the Air]]. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the [[RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra]], which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under contracts.\n\nOn October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City's Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of [[George Enescu]]'s ''[[Romanian Rhapsodies (Enescu)#Rhapsody No. 1 in A major|Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1]]'' and the waltz from [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with [[Pierre Monteux]] conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Charles M\u00fcnch]], in a performance of ''The Damnation of Faust'' by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini's final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and [[Guido Cantelli]] respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under [[Fritz Reiner]]. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30&nbsp;inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300\u20133 one-half inch machine, running at 15&nbsp;inches per second (which was later increased to 30&nbsp;inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the \"Living Stereo\" logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these recordings on CD.<ref>''The History of Living Stereo'', RCA Victor liner notes</ref> Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building [[Webster Hall]] into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968.\n\nIn September 1954, RCA Victor introduced \"Gruve-Gard\" where the center and edge of a record are thicker\nthan the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Clint |last=Hough |url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/60trivia/60trivia.htm |title=Bringing on back the good times |publisher=Sixties City |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.\n\nIn 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of [[Elvis Presley]] from [[Sun Records]] for the then-astronomical sum of $35,000. Presley would become RCA Victor's biggest-selling recording artist. His first gold record was \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", recorded in January 1956. RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles during 1956.\n\nRCA began making plans in 1955 to establish its own European presence issuing records on the RCA label.<ref name=\"Inc.1955\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|date=15 October 1955|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=3\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, effective in 1957, RCA ended its 55-year association with EMI/HMV, after EMI's acquisition of [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"Inc.1956\">{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |title=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |date=17 March 1956 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=14\u2013 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref name=\"MartinHornsby1994\">{{cite book |author1=Sir George Martin |author2=Jeremy Hornsby |title=All You Need Is Ears: The Inside Personal Story of the Genius who Created The Beatles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yoio9MewhcC&pg=PA84 |date=15 October 1994 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-11482-4 |pages=84\u2013 }}</ref> Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in North and South America, with RCA Victor distributing its recordings through [[Decca Records]] in the United Kingdom on the RCA label, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&trademark=325592 |publisher=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office |title=Trade Mark Details as at 13 November 2012: Case details for Trade Mark 325592 |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=British RCA to Cut Decca Ltd.

In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megocollector.com/elvis-presley/33-rpm-7-elvis-presley/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-compact-33-record/ |title=The Rise and Fall of the Compact 33 Record |publisher=Megocollector.com |date= December 18, 2009|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, RCA Victor introduced [[Dynagroove]] which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether it was actually an improvement or not is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly discontinued Dynagroove around 1970.\n\nIn September 1965, RCA and [[Learjet|Lear Jet Corp.]] teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges ([[Stereo 8]]) which were first used in the 1966 line of [[Ford]] automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden's catalog of artists.)\n\nIn 1968, the [[RCA Corporation]] modernized its image with what was then a new futuristic-looking logo (the letters RCA in block modernized form), replacing the old lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master's Voice trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records, \"Victor\" now restricted to the album covers and labels of RCA's regular popular record releases, while the Nipper trademark was seen only on the album covers of [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] records. The color of the labels, which had always been black for the popular series (as opposed to the Red Seal line), was changed to a bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly later in 1975\u201376).\n\nIn late 1969, RCA Records introduced a very thin, lightweight vinyl LP known as [[Dynaflex (RCA)|Dynaflex]]. This type of pressing claimed to overcome warping and other problems in conventional thicker pressings, but it had a controversial reputation in the industry and was abandoned by the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belam |first1=Martin |title=Dynaflex \u2013 RCA's 1970s ultra-thin vinyl |url=http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2008/01/dynaflex---rcas-1970s-ultra-th.php |website=www.currybet.net |publisher=Martin Belam |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The 1970s===\n[[File:RCA Records, Harry Nilsson - Nilsson Schmilsson.jpg|thumb|right|Platinum record of album ''[[Nilsson Schmilsson]]'', featuring the 1968\u201375 Orange RCA Victor label]]\nIn April 1970, RCA Records announced the first [[quadraphonic]] 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges (\"Quad-8\", later called just Q8). RCA began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became \"Quadradisc\". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a \u00b11&nbsp;db frequency response out to 50&nbsp;kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30&nbsp;kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4\u20134\u20134 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4\u20132\u20134 matrix system. The [[Warner Music Group]] labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording by 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for [[matrix decoder#Dolby MP matrix encoding (2:4)|Dolby encoding]] (same as [[Peter Scheiber]]'s original matrix system) and released on CD. This included [[Charles Gerhardt (conductor)|Charles Gerhardt]]'s acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], [[Max Steiner]], [[Franz Waxman]], and others, performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and recorded in London's [[Kingsway Hall]].\n\nBeginning in late 1976, the RCA Corporation revived the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, [[RCA Victrola|Victrola]], [[RCA Red Seal|Red Seal]] and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as store displays and promotional items such as [[T-shirts]], posters, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also painted on RCA delivery and service trucks.\n\n===The 1980s===\nIn 1983, [[Arista Records]] owner [[Bertelsmann]] sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International.<ref name=\"bertelsmann.com\">{{citation |url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |title=RCA: Now Elvis rocked for Bertelsmann, too |publisher=Bertelsmann Worldwide Media}}</ref> The following year, RCA Corporation was acquired by [[General Electric]] (GE) and it sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann.

BMG also revived the \"RCA Victor\" label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to \"overpriced deals\" with pop stars including [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Diana Ross]]. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 acts to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with [[Beggars Banquet Records]] and [[Jive Records]], whose roster included [[Schooly D]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]].\n\nBy the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, its most profitable year to date. [[Bruce Hornsby]]'s ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' sold more than three million albums, and the [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, ''[[More Dirty Dancing]]'', composed of song tracks which had been left out of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million. Among the most successful acts for RCA Records during the 1980s were the [[Eurythmics]], [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], [[Joshua Perahia]], [[Rick Astley]] and [[Bucks Fizz]].<ref name=\"LA Times 1980s\">{{cite news |last1=Knoedelselder, Jr. |first1=William |title=Rap On RCA Records: The Original U.S. Record Company Is Back In Groove |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-18/business/fi-3214_1_rca-records |accessdate=August 14, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 18, 1998}}</ref><ref name=\"RCA Hit Men\">{{cite book |last1=Dannen |first1=Frederic |title=Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business |date=July 2, 1991 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780679730613 |page=260 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Oa97Z7pOWPYC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=Bob+Buziak++President+of+RCA+Records+US+1986#v=onepage&q=Bob%20Buziak%20%20President%20of%20RCA%20Records%20US%201986&f=false |accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The 1990s===\nIn August 1990 Buziak was replaced by [[Joe Galante]], who had been the president of RCA Records Nashville division.

(musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at [[Lincoln Center]], such as the 1966 revivals of ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', the 1987 revival of ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and the 1998 Broadway revivals of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star [[Ethel Merman]], who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American [[Decca Records]] contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by [[Dinah Shore]]. RCA Victor was also responsible for the [[film soundtrack]] albums of ''Damn Yankees'', ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The album made from the 1965 hit [[Julie Andrews]] film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', made by [[Colgems Records]], was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.\n\nSimilarly, RCA Victor also made several [[Studio recording|studio cast recording]] albums, including a [[Lerner and Loewe]] series with [[Jan Peerce]], [[Jane Powell]], and [[Robert Merrill]], as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', with its 1952 revival leads, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of ''Show Boat'', one with Robert Merrill, [[Patrice Munsel]], and [[Rise Stevens]] in 1956, and the other with [[Howard Keel]], [[Anne Jeffreys]], and [[Gogi Grant]] in 1958. Unfortunately, contrary to the way the show is written, both of these ''Show Boat'' albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation.\n\nIn 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new [[Masterworks Broadway Records]]. All of these recordings are now on [[Masterworks Broadway Records]], which has remastered and reissued many of these albums.\n\n==Criticism and controversies==\n===Kelly Clarkson===\nIn the summer of 2007, [[Kelly Clarkson]] and Clive Davis, then head of [[Sony BMG]], feuded publicly regarding the direction of her album ''[[My December]]'', the follow-up to Clarkson's multi-platinum album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. Clarkson wrote the songs on ''My December'', \"showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare\", and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on \"polished, radio-friendly songs\". Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007. It has since been certified platinum.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6524077/kelly-clarkson-worth-american-idol-contract |title=Now Free From Her Idol Contract, What's Kelly Clarkson Worth? |magazine=Billboard |date=April 3, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Benjamin |first=Jeff |url=http://www.fuse.tv/2015/03/kelly-clarkson-kept-it-so-real-best-moments |title=9 Times Kelly Clarkson Kept it Real |publisher=Fuse |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Du Lac |first1=J.

By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Bennie Moten]], [[Duke Ellington]] and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 \"Hot Dance\" series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 \"race\" ([[race records]]) series, a 23000 'hot dance' continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 'Race' series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, Victor's involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians' strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&B (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elvispresleymuseum.com/RCA_Victor.html |title=RCA Victor |work=elvispresleymuseum |access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Victor decided to demolish its [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] warehouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/label/rca_victor |title=Label: RCA Victor |publisher=RateyourMusic.com}}</ref> This warehouse reportedly held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by [[Enrico Caruso]]; why [[Rachmaninoff]]'s apparently weren't saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff's birth, RCA decided to reissue his complete recordings on LP; RCA was forced to go to collectors for copies of certain records because their archives were incomplete, as documented in a ''Time'' magazine article.\n\n==Other RCA labels==\n*RCA Records (UK): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music UK]], since 2006, which acts as an import label of American and multinational [[Sony Music]] artists, and also signs UK and Irish artists, including [[Paloma Faith]], [[Everything Everything]], [[Laura Mvula]], [[Little Mix]], [[Olly Murs]], and [[Kodaline]].\n*[[RCA Red Seal Records]]: The RCA Red Seal [[European Classical Music|classical music]] label is now part of [[Sony Masterworks]].\n*RCA Records (France): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music France]].

The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. The format was abandoned by 1933, and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edward |first1=David |title=RCA Program Transcription Album Discography (1931\u201333) |url=http://bsnpubs.com/rca/rca/rca33.html |website=bsnpubs.com |publisher=Both Sides Now Publications |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early part of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful cheap label to compete with the \"dime store labels\" ([[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], etc.). The first was the short-lived \"Timely Tunes\" label in 1931 sold at Montgomery Ward. [[Bluebird Records]] was created in 1932 as a sub-label of RCA Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside an 8-inch Electradisk label (sold at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s). Neither were a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird's label was redesigned, and it became known as the 'buff' label). Another cheap label, Sunrise, was produced (although nobody seems to know for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label still survives today, eight decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued. RCA Victor also produced records for [[Montgomery Ward]] label during the 1930s.\n\nBesides manufacturing records for themselves, RCA Victor operated RCA Custom which was the leading record manufacturer for [[independent record label]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quality Go Together at RCA Records |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NSEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22rca+custom%22%2B+leading#v=onepage&q=%22rca%20custom%22%2B%20leading&f=false |website=via Google |publisher=Billboard (archived ad) |accessdate=August 19, 2015 |date=October 6, 1958}}</ref> RCA Custom also pressed many record compilations for [[The Reader's Digest Association]].\n\nRCA sold its interest in EMI in 1935, but EMI continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the [[His Master's Voice|HMV]] label until the late 1950s. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and custom HMV labels in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |title=RCA Victor Red Seal Labelography (19501976) |first=Ron |last=Penndorf |work=RECOLLECTIONS: Fine Vintage LPs and Journal of Recorded Music |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111011131/http://ronpenndorf.com/labelography4.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===World War II era===\nDuring World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese affiliate [[JVC]] were severed. JVC's record company is known today as [[Victor Entertainment]] and still retains the [[Nipper]]/[[His Master's Voice]] trademark for use in Japan.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the [[American Federation of Musicians]] [[1942\u201344 musicians' strike|recording ban]]. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. However, RCA Victor lost the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] during this period; the orchestra's contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when [[Columbia Records]] settled with the union before RCA, [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968.\n\n===The post-war 1940s===\n[[File:Down Yonder.jpg|thumb|right|Standard RCA Victor 78 RPM label design from just after the end of [[World War II]] until 1954]]\nIn the spring of 1946, \"RCA Victor\" replaced \"Victor\" on labels for shellac 78 rpm singles. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] micro-grooved [[vinylite]] record, marketed simply as the \"45\". The new format, which had been under development for several years, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs.<ref>Carson, B.H. et al. (1949) [http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/speed45.html \"A Record Changer and Record of Complementary Design\"], ''RCA Review'', June 1949, as reprinted by the Audio Engineering Society (retrieved January 5, 2013)</ref> By the time RCA Victor belatedly unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33\u2153&nbsp;rpm microgroove vinyl \"[[LP record|LP]]\" (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival [[Columbia Records]] in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor's 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-XXXX series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on \"midnight blue\" vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children's fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was \"PeeWee the Piccolo\" RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Avenue plant Indianapolis, R.O. Price, plant manager.<ref>Indiana State Museum document no. 71.2010.098.0001</ref> The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty [[shellac]] compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dawson, Jim and |first1=Propes, Steve |title=45 Rpm: The History, Heroes and Villains of a Pop Music Revolution |date=October 1, 2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0879307579 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AiA-6xfdqC0C&pg=PA24&dq=rca+45+rpm+record+player+1949#v=onepage&q=rca%2045%20rpm%20record%20player%201949&f=false |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78&nbsp;rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some \"[[extended play]]\" (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for some vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] disc featuring [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Marche Slave]]'' and [[Ket\u00e8lbey]]'s ''[[In a Persian Market]]''. Boxed sets of four to six 45s were issued, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP. (An extreme case of these boxed sets was the complete recording of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'', conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]], which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs.) In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another was started up. These disruptive \"side breaks\", a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78&nbsp;rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor's 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor's massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia's LP prevailed as the format for classical music and convenient one-disc \"album\" collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950.\n\n===The 1950s===\nFinally acknowledging the success of Columbia's LP format and fearful of losing further market share, RCA Victor began issuing LPs itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html |title=LPs historic |first=Edward |last=Wallerstein |publisher=Musicinthemail.com |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11 |title=Diskery Goes 33 in March To Service Entire Market; 45 Promotion in High Gear |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=January 7, 1950 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was a performance of ''[[Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne]]'' by [[Jacques Offenbach]], played by [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]], which had actually been recorded in [[Boston]]'s [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]] on June 20, 1947; it was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical albums were issued with the prefix \"LPM\". When RCA Victor later issued classical stereo albums (in 1958), they used the prefix \"LSC\". Non-classical stereo albums were issued with the prefix \"LSP\". RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973.\n\nIn the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: [[Groove Records|Groove]], [[Vik Recordings|Vik]] and \"X\".\n\nThe edition of ''Billboard'' magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label \u201cX\u201d; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label \"X\" on April 20, 1953. Groove was an [[R&B]] specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~v1tiger/labelX.html |title=Label \"X\" |year=2005 |first=JC |last=Marion |journal=Jamm Upp |volume=2 |issue=36}}</ref> the Vik label was discontinued the following year.\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in intense competition with [[Columbia Records]]. A number of recordings were made with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of [[acoustic recording]]s, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the [[Symphony of the Air]]. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the [[RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra]], which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under contracts.\n\nOn October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City's Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of [[George Enescu]]'s ''[[Romanian Rhapsodies (Enescu)#Rhapsody No. 1 in A major|Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1]]'' and the waltz from [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with [[Pierre Monteux]] conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Charles M\u00fcnch]], in a performance of ''The Damnation of Faust'' by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini's final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and [[Guido Cantelli]] respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under [[Fritz Reiner]]. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30&nbsp;inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300\u20133 one-half inch machine, running at 15&nbsp;inches per second (which was later increased to 30&nbsp;inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the \"Living Stereo\" logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these recordings on CD.<ref>''The History of Living Stereo'', RCA Victor liner notes</ref> Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building [[Webster Hall]] into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968.\n\nIn September 1954, RCA Victor introduced \"Gruve-Gard\" where the center and edge of a record are thicker\nthan the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Clint |last=Hough |url=http://www.sixtiescity.net/60trivia/60trivia.htm |title=Bringing on back the good times |publisher=Sixties City |date= |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.\n\nIn 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of [[Elvis Presley]] from [[Sun Records]] for the then-astronomical sum of $35,000. Presley would become RCA Victor's biggest-selling recording artist. His first gold record was \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", recorded in January 1956. RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles during 1956.\n\nRCA began making plans in 1955 to establish its own European presence issuing records on the RCA label.<ref name=\"Inc.1955\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT3|date=15 October 1955|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=3\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, effective in 1957, RCA ended its 55-year association with EMI/HMV, after EMI's acquisition of [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"Inc.1956\">{{cite book |author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |title=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8x4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |date=17 March 1956 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=14\u2013 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref name=\"MartinHornsby1994\">{{cite book |author1=Sir George Martin |author2=Jeremy Hornsby |title=All You Need Is Ears: The Inside Personal Story of the Genius who Created The Beatles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Yoio9MewhcC&pg=PA84 |date=15 October 1994 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-11482-4 |pages=84\u2013 }}</ref> Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in North and South America, with RCA Victor distributing its recordings through [[Decca Records]] in the United Kingdom on the RCA label, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=H&trademark=325592 |publisher=United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office |title=Trade Mark Details as at 13 November 2012: Case details for Trade Mark 325592 |date=September 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2012}}</ref> RCA set up its own British distribution in 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=British RCA to Cut Decca Ltd.

In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megocollector.com/elvis-presley/33-rpm-7-elvis-presley/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-compact-33-record/ |title=The Rise and Fall of the Compact 33 Record |publisher=Megocollector.com |date= December 18, 2009|accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, RCA Victor introduced [[Dynagroove]] which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether it was actually an improvement or not is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly discontinued Dynagroove around 1970.\n\nIn September 1965, RCA and [[Learjet|Lear Jet Corp.]] teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges ([[Stereo 8]]) which were first used in the 1966 line of [[Ford]] automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden's catalog of artists.)\n\nIn 1968, the [[RCA Corporation]] modernized its image with what was then a new futuristic-looking logo (the letters RCA in block modernized form), replacing the old lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master's Voice trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records, \"Victor\" now restricted to the album covers and labels of RCA's regular popular record releases, while the Nipper trademark was seen only on the album covers of [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] records. The color of the labels, which had always been black for the popular series (as opposed to the Red Seal line), was changed to a bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly later in 1975\u201376).\n\nIn late 1969, RCA Records introduced a very thin, lightweight vinyl LP known as [[Dynaflex (RCA)|Dynaflex]]. This type of pressing claimed to overcome warping and other problems in conventional thicker pressings, but it had a controversial reputation in the industry and was abandoned by the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belam |first1=Martin |title=Dynaflex \u2013 RCA's 1970s ultra-thin vinyl |url=http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2008/01/dynaflex---rcas-1970s-ultra-th.php |website=www.currybet.net |publisher=Martin Belam |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The 1970s===\n[[File:RCA Records, Harry Nilsson - Nilsson Schmilsson.jpg|thumb|right|Platinum record of album ''[[Nilsson Schmilsson]]'', featuring the 1968\u201375 Orange RCA Victor label]]\nIn April 1970, RCA Records announced the first [[quadraphonic]] 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges (\"Quad-8\", later called just Q8). RCA began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became \"Quadradisc\". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a \u00b11&nbsp;db frequency response out to 50&nbsp;kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30&nbsp;kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4\u20134\u20134 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4\u20132\u20134 matrix system. The [[Warner Music Group]] labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording by 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for [[matrix decoder#Dolby MP matrix encoding (2:4)|Dolby encoding]] (same as [[Peter Scheiber]]'s original matrix system) and released on CD. This included [[Charles Gerhardt (conductor)|Charles Gerhardt]]'s acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], [[Dimitri Tiomkin]], [[Max Steiner]], [[Franz Waxman]], and others, performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and recorded in London's [[Kingsway Hall]].\n\nBeginning in late 1976, the RCA Corporation revived the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, [[RCA Victrola|Victrola]], [[RCA Red Seal|Red Seal]] and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master's Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as store displays and promotional items such as [[T-shirts]], posters, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also painted on RCA delivery and service trucks.\n\n===The 1980s===\nIn 1983, [[Arista Records]] owner [[Bertelsmann]] sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International.<ref name=\"bertelsmann.com\">{{citation |url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |title=RCA: Now Elvis rocked for Bertelsmann, too |publisher=Bertelsmann Worldwide Media}}</ref> The following year, RCA Corporation was acquired by [[General Electric]] (GE) and it sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann.

BMG also revived the \"RCA Victor\" label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to \"overpriced deals\" with pop stars including [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Diana Ross]]. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 acts to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with [[Beggars Banquet Records]] and [[Jive Records]], whose roster included [[Schooly D]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]].\n\nBy the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, its most profitable year to date. [[Bruce Hornsby]]'s ''[[The Way It Is (Bruce Hornsby album)|The Way It Is]]'' sold more than three million albums, and the [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, ''[[More Dirty Dancing]]'', composed of song tracks which had been left out of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million.

(musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at [[Lincoln Center]], such as the 1966 revivals of ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', the 1987 revival of ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and the 1998 Broadway revivals of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. ''[[Call Me Madam]]'' was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star [[Ethel Merman]], who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American [[Decca Records]] contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by [[Dinah Shore]]. RCA Victor was also responsible for the [[film soundtrack]] albums of ''Damn Yankees'', ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence (film)|Half a Sixpence]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. The album made from the 1965 hit [[Julie Andrews]] film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'', made by [[Colgems Records]], was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.\n\nSimilarly, RCA Victor also made several [[Studio recording|studio cast recording]] albums, including a [[Lerner and Loewe]] series with [[Jan Peerce]], [[Jane Powell]], and [[Robert Merrill]], as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', with its 1952 revival leads, [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of ''Show Boat'', one with Robert Merrill, [[Patrice Munsel]], and [[Rise Stevens]] in 1956, and the other with [[Howard Keel]], [[Anne Jeffreys]], and [[Gogi Grant]] in 1958. Unfortunately, contrary to the way the show is written, both of these ''Show Boat'' albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation.\n\nIn 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new [[Masterworks Broadway Records]].

Clarkson wrote the songs on ''My December'', \"showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare\", and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on \"polished, radio-friendly songs\". Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007.

By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Bennie Moten]], [[Duke Ellington]] and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 \"Hot Dance\" series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 \"race\" ([[race records]]) series, a 23000 'hot dance' continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 'Race' series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, Victor's involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians' strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&B (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elvispresleymuseum.com/RCA_Victor.html |title=RCA Victor |work=elvispresleymuseum |access-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Victor decided to demolish its [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]] warehouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rateyourmusic.com/label/rca_victor |title=Label: RCA Victor |publisher=RateyourMusic.com}}</ref> This warehouse reportedly held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by [[Enrico Caruso]]; why [[Rachmaninoff]]'s apparently weren't saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff's birth, RCA decided to reissue his complete recordings on LP; RCA was forced to go to collectors for copies of certain records because their archives were incomplete, as documented in a ''Time'' magazine article.\n\n==Other RCA labels==\n*RCA Records (UK): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music UK]], since 2006, which acts as an import label of American and multinational [[Sony Music]] artists, and also signs UK and Irish artists, including [[Paloma Faith]], [[Everything Everything]], [[Laura Mvula]], [[Little Mix]], [[Olly Murs]], and [[Kodaline]].\n*[[RCA Red Seal Records]]: The RCA Red Seal [[European Classical Music|classical music]] label is now part of [[Sony Masterworks]].\n*RCA Records (France): A division of [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music France]].

After the Norman invasion, the position of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part as a result of the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out.  The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the twelfth century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being [[Forced marriage|forcibly remarried]] against their wishes.  The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour.  As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with [[ploughing]] and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and [[Dairy farming|dairy production]] becoming dominated by women.<ref>{{citation | last = Mate | first = Mavis E. | contribution = Trade within and outside the Market-Place | editor-last = Mate | editor-first = Mavis | title = Trade and economic developments, 1450-1550: the experience of Kent, Surrey and Sussex | pages = 21&ndash;27 | publisher = Boydell Press | location = Woodbridge, UK Rochester, New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781843831891 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Johns | first = Susan M. | title = Noblewomen, aristocracy, and power in the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman realm | pages = 22&ndash;25, 30, 69, 195&ndash;96 14 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780719063053 }}</ref>\n\nIn medieval times, women had responsibility for brewing and selling the ale that men all drank.

They governed witchcraft and providing penalties for its practice, or\u2014in 1735\u2014rather for pretending to practise it.\n\nIn Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kamerick | first = Kathleen | title = Tanglost of Wales: magic and adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500 | journal = [[Sixteenth Century Journal]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 25&ndash;45 | publisher = [[Truman State University]] | date = Spring 2013 | url = https://www.escj.org/article/tanglost-wales-magic-and-adultery-court-chancery-circa-1500 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nThe records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536-1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law.

He set out the much stiffer [[Witchcraft Acts|Witchcraft Act of 1604]], which made it a felony under common law. One goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lolis | first = Thomas G. | title = The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the homosocial refashioning of the witches' community | journal = Clio: A Journal of Literature, History, and the Philosophy of History | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 322&ndash;337 | publisher = [[Indiana University]], [[Purdue University]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] | date = Summer 2008 | url = https://www.ipfw.edu/dotAsset/99968.pdf | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nEnlightenment attitudes after 1700 made a mockery of beliefs in witches. The [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] marked a complete reversal in attitudes. Penalties for the practice of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft. A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment.<ref>Henderson, Lizanne (2016), \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=EK3tCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA330 Appendix II: The Witchcraft Act, 1735]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Henderson | editor-first = Lizanne | title = Witchcraft and folk belief in the age of enlightenment: Scotland 1670-1740 | pages = 330&ndash;331 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781137313249 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nHistorians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] revolutionized the study of witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.<ref>{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Keith | author-link = Keith Thomas (historian) | title = Religion and the decline of magic: studies in popular beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century England | publisher = Weidenfeld & Nicolson | location = London | year = 1971 | isbn = 9780297819721 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Barry | first = Jonathan | contribution = Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft | editor-last1 = Barry | editor-first1 = Jonathan | editor-last2 = Hester | editor-first2 = Marianne | editor-last3 = Roberts | editor-first3 = Gareth | title = Witchcraft in early modern Europe: studies in culture and belief | pages = [https://archive.org/details/witchcraftinearl0000unse/page/1 1&ndash;46] | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780521552240 | ref = harv | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/witchcraftinearl0000unse/page/1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = MacFarlane | first = Alan | title = Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: a regional and comparative study | url = https://archive.org/details/witchcraftintudo00alan | url-access = registration | publisher = Harper & Row | location = New York | year = 1970 | isbn = 9780710064035 }}</ref> They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic.

Clark argues that in 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in operating some trades and landed estates. For example, they brewed beer, handled the milk and butter, raised chickens and pigs, grew vegetables and fruit, spun flax and wool into thread, sewed and patched clothing, and nursed the sick. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on more powerful women.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Clark | first = Alice | author-link = Alice Clark | title = The working life of women in the seventeenth century | publisher = Routledge | location = London | oclc = 459278936 | year = 1919 }}</ref> In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinchbeck | first = Ivy | author-link = Ivy Pinchbeck | title = Women workers and the industrial revolution 1750-1850 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | origyear = 1930 | isbn = 9781138874633 }}</ref>  [[Louise Tilly]] and [[Joan Wallach Scott]] have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history.

The third or modern stage is the \"family consumer economy,\" in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Tilly | first1 = Louise | last2 = Wallach Scott | first2 = Joan | author-link1 = Louise Tilly | author-link2 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Women, work, and family | publisher = Methuen | location = New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780416016819 }}</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Fertility===\nIn the Victorian era, fertility rates increased in every decade until 1901, when the rates started evening out.<ref>{{cite book | last = Szreter | first = Simon | title = Fertility, class, and gender in Britain, 1860-1940 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780521528689 }}</ref>  There are several reasons for the increase in birth rates. One is biological: with improving living standards, the percentage of women who were able to have children increased. Another possible explanation is social. In the 19th century, the marriage rate increased, and people were getting married at a very young age until the end of the century, when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly. The reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain.

Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards (and usually followed them), but have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as [[Henry Mayhew]] decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births.  However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low\u2014under 5%\u2014for the working class and the poor. By contrast in 21st century Britain, nearly half of all children are born outside marriage, and nine in ten newlyweds have been cohabitating.<ref>{{cite news | last = Probert | first = Rebecca | title = Living in sin | work = [[BBC History Magazine]] | url = http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/living-sin-common-law-marriage-unmarried-relationships-victorian-britain | date = October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Frost | first = Ginger | title = Living in sin | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780719085697 }}</ref>\n\nHistorians have begun to analyze the agency of women in overseas missions.

Identifiable characteristics came to define the middle-class home and lifestyle. Previously, in town and city, residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site, virtually occupying the same geographical space. The difference between private life and commerce was a fluid one distinguished by an informal demarcation of function. In the Victorian era, English family life increasingly became compartmentalised, the home a self-contained structure housing a nuclear family extended according to need and circumstance to include blood relations. The concept of \"privacy\" became a hallmark of the middle class life. {{Quote|text=The English home closed up and darkened over the decade (1850s), the cult of domesticity matched by a cult of privacy.

Coal-dust from home stoves and factories filled the city air, coating windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. Washing clothing and linens meant scrubbing by hand in a large zinc or copper tub. Some water would be heated and added to the wash tub, and perhaps a handful of soda to soften the water.  Curtains were taken down and washed every fortnight; they were often so blackened by coal smoke that they had to be soaked in salted water before being washed.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford.  It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England.  The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class.  A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace.  The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Stone | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n====Protection====\nA series of four laws called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]]  passed  Parliament from 1870 to 1882 that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free.  The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand.  The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498&ndash;500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187&ndash;222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197&ndash;215 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Work opportunities===\nThe rapid growth of factories opened jobbed opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled women and light industries, such as textiles, clothing, and food production.

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. In 1877, the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland became the first institution to take advantage of the Enabling Act of 1876 and admit women to take its medical licences.

The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial assistance.

Third, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members.<ref name=thane/> Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food.

In Wales the suffragists women were attacked as outsiders  and were usually treated with rudeness and often violence when they demonstrated or spoke publicly. The idea of Welshness was by then highly masculine because of its identification with labouring in heavy industry and mining and with militant union action.<ref>{{cite journal | last = John | first = Angela V. | title = 'Run Like Blazes' the Suffragettes and Welshness | journal = [[Llafur]] | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 29&ndash;43 | publisher = [[Llafur|Llafur: The Welsh People's History Society]] | date = 1994 | ref = harv | hdl = 10107/1328679 }}</ref>\n\nThe radical protests steadily became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, burning mailboxes, and arson of unoccupied buildings. [[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of an actual revolt in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, historian Robert Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media. The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389&ndash;399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref>  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of moderate suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  They increasingly repudiated the extremists as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Historian [[G. R. Searle]] says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended. Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358&ndash;374 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed.

This often came at the cost of the [[Liberty|liberation]] and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children's needs, as advocated, for example, by [[John Bowlby]] the head of the Children's Department at the [[Tavistock Clinic]], who  published extensively throughout the 1950s and by [[Donald Winnicott]] who promoted through [[Radio programming|radio broadcasts]] and in the [[Newspaper|press]] the idea of the home as a private emotional world in which mother and child are bound to each other and in which the mother has control and finds freedom to fulfill herself.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Finch | first1 = Janet | last2 = Summerfield | first2 = Penny | contribution = Social reconstruction and the emergence of companionate marriage, 1945\u201359 | editor-last = Clark | editor-first = David | title = Marriage, domestic life, and social change: writings for Jacqueline Burgoyne, 1944-88 | page = 11 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York, New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780415032469 | ref = harv | postscript = .| title-link = Jacqueline Burgoyne }}</ref>\n\n===Political and sexual roles===\nWomen's political roles grew in the 20th century after the first woman entered the House in 1919.

One notable event was the publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[Penguin Books]] in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive [[Mass marketing|mass-market]] [[paperback]] version prompted a court case. The prosecuting council's question, \"Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?\" highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen as one of the first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. Other elements of the [[sexual revolution]] included the development of [[The Pill]], [[Mary Quant]]'s [[miniskirt]] and the 1967 legalisation of [[homosexuality]]. There was a rise in the incidence of divorce and abortion, and a resurgence of the [[women's liberation movement]], whose campaigning helped secure the [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act]] and the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act]] in 1975.  The Irish Catholics, traditionally the most puritanical of the ethno-religious groups, eased up a little, especially as the membership disregarded the bishops teaching that contraception was sinful.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Geiringer | first = David | title = Catholic understandings of female sexuality in 1960s Britain | journal = 20th Century British History | volume =  28| issue =  2| pages =  209\u2013238| publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/tcbh/hww051 | pmid = 28922825 | date = November 2016 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==21st century==\nFrom 2007 to 2015, [[Harriet Harman]] was Deputy Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the UK's current opposition party.

After the Norman invasion, the position of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part as a result of the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out.  The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the twelfth century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being [[Forced marriage|forcibly remarried]] against their wishes.  The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour.  As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with [[ploughing]] and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and [[Dairy farming|dairy production]] becoming dominated by women.<ref>{{citation | last = Mate | first = Mavis E. | contribution = Trade within and outside the Market-Place | editor-last = Mate | editor-first = Mavis | title = Trade and economic developments, 1450-1550: the experience of Kent, Surrey and Sussex | pages = 21&ndash;27 | publisher = Boydell Press | location = Woodbridge, UK Rochester, New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781843831891 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Johns | first = Susan M. | title = Noblewomen, aristocracy, and power in the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman realm | pages = 22&ndash;25, 30, 69, 195&ndash;96 14 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780719063053 }}</ref>\n\nIn medieval times, women had responsibility for brewing and selling the ale that men all drank.

They governed witchcraft and providing penalties for its practice, or\u2014in 1735\u2014rather for pretending to practise it.\n\nIn Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kamerick | first = Kathleen | title = Tanglost of Wales: magic and adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500 | journal = [[Sixteenth Century Journal]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 25&ndash;45 | publisher = [[Truman State University]] | date = Spring 2013 | url = https://www.escj.org/article/tanglost-wales-magic-and-adultery-court-chancery-circa-1500 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nThe records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536-1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law.

He set out the much stiffer [[Witchcraft Acts|Witchcraft Act of 1604]], which made it a felony under common law. One goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lolis | first = Thomas G. | title = The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the homosocial refashioning of the witches' community | journal = Clio: A Journal of Literature, History, and the Philosophy of History | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 322&ndash;337 | publisher = [[Indiana University]], [[Purdue University]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] | date = Summer 2008 | url = https://www.ipfw.edu/dotAsset/99968.pdf | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nEnlightenment attitudes after 1700 made a mockery of beliefs in witches. The [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] marked a complete reversal in attitudes. Penalties for the practice of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft.

Clark argues that in 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in operating some trades and landed estates. For example, they brewed beer, handled the milk and butter, raised chickens and pigs, grew vegetables and fruit, spun flax and wool into thread, sewed and patched clothing, and nursed the sick. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on more powerful women.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Clark | first = Alice | author-link = Alice Clark | title = The working life of women in the seventeenth century | publisher = Routledge | location = London | oclc = 459278936 | year = 1919 }}</ref> In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinchbeck | first = Ivy | author-link = Ivy Pinchbeck | title = Women workers and the industrial revolution 1750-1850 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | origyear = 1930 | isbn = 9781138874633 }}</ref>  [[Louise Tilly]] and [[Joan Wallach Scott]] have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history.

One is biological: with improving living standards, the percentage of women who were able to have children increased. Another possible explanation is social. In the 19th century, the marriage rate increased, and people were getting married at a very young age until the end of the century, when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly. The reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain.

Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards (and usually followed them), but have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as [[Henry Mayhew]] decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births.  However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low\u2014under 5%\u2014for the working class and the poor. By contrast in 21st century Britain, nearly half of all children are born outside marriage, and nine in ten newlyweds have been cohabitating.<ref>{{cite news | last = Probert | first = Rebecca | title = Living in sin | work = [[BBC History Magazine]] | url = http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/living-sin-common-law-marriage-unmarried-relationships-victorian-britain | date = October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Frost | first = Ginger | title = Living in sin | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780719085697 }}</ref>\n\nHistorians have begun to analyze the agency of women in overseas missions.

Wives assisted their missionary husbands in most of his roles.

Identifiable characteristics came to define the middle-class home and lifestyle. Previously, in town and city, residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site, virtually occupying the same geographical space. The difference between private life and commerce was a fluid one distinguished by an informal demarcation of function. In the Victorian era, English family life increasingly became compartmentalised, the home a self-contained structure housing a nuclear family extended according to need and circumstance to include blood relations. The concept of \"privacy\" became a hallmark of the middle class life. {{Quote|text=The English home closed up and darkened over the decade (1850s), the cult of domesticity matched by a cult of privacy.

Coal-dust from home stoves and factories filled the city air, coating windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. Washing clothing and linens meant scrubbing by hand in a large zinc or copper tub. Some water would be heated and added to the wash tub, and perhaps a handful of soda to soften the water.  Curtains were taken down and washed every fortnight; they were often so blackened by coal smoke that they had to be soaked in salted water before being washed. Scrubbing the front wooden doorstep of the home every morning was done to maintain respectability.<ref>{{citation | last = Murray | first = Janet Horowitz | contribution = Domestic life in poverty | editor-last = Murray | editor-first = Janet Horowitz | title = Strong-minded women: and other lost voices from nineteenth-century England | pages = 177&ndash;179 | publisher = Penguin Books | location = Aylesbury | year = 1984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\n===Leisure===\n{{main|Women in the Victorian era#Leisure activities}}\nOpportunities for leisure activities increased dramatically as real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline.

The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by Barbara Bodichon (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835.  The Chartist Movement was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014but it meant ''manhood'' suffrage.   Upper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society.  However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n====Child custody ====\nBefore 1839, after divorce rich women lost control of their children as those children would continue in the family unit with the father, as head of the household, and who continued to be responsible for them. [[Caroline Norton]] was one such woman, her personal tragedy where she was denied access to her three sons after a divorce, led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] and then introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement.<ref name=\"Wroath_Seven\">{{cite book | last = Wroath | first = John | title = Until they are seven: the origins of women's legal rights | publisher = Waterside Press | location = Winchester England | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781872870571 | url = https://archive.org/details/untiltheyareseve00wroa }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = L.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford.  It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England.  The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class.  A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace.  The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Stone | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n====Protection====\nA series of four laws called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]]  passed  Parliament from 1870 to 1882 that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free.  The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand.  The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498&ndash;500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187&ndash;222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197&ndash;215 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Work opportunities===\nThe rapid growth of factories opened jobbed opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled women and light industries, such as textiles, clothing, and food production.

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. In 1877, the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland became the first institution to take advantage of the Enabling Act of 1876 and admit women to take its medical licences.

The act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender conditions. In Edwardian society, men were the source of wealth. The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial assistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was passed, women and children received most of the aid.

Third, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members.<ref name=thane/> Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food.

In Wales the suffragists women were attacked as outsiders  and were usually treated with rudeness and often violence when they demonstrated or spoke publicly. The idea of Welshness was by then highly masculine because of its identification with labouring in heavy industry and mining and with militant union action.<ref>{{cite journal | last = John | first = Angela V. | title = 'Run Like Blazes' the Suffragettes and Welshness | journal = [[Llafur]] | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 29&ndash;43 | publisher = [[Llafur|Llafur: The Welsh People's History Society]] | date = 1994 | ref = harv | hdl = 10107/1328679 }}</ref>\n\nThe radical protests steadily became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, burning mailboxes, and arson of unoccupied buildings. [[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of an actual revolt in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, historian Robert Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media. The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389&ndash;399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref>  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of moderate suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  They increasingly repudiated the extremists as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Historian [[G. R. Searle]] says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended. Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358&ndash;374 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed.

Families also grew [[victory garden]]s, and small home vegetable gardens, to supply themselves with food. Many things were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for [[nitroglycerin]] production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally sourced unrationed products than people in metropolitan areas and were more able to grow their own.\n\nThe rationing system, which had been originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed the housewives to make choices based on their own priorities.

This often came at the cost of the [[Liberty|liberation]] and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children's needs, as advocated, for example, by [[John Bowlby]] the head of the Children's Department at the [[Tavistock Clinic]], who  published extensively throughout the 1950s and by [[Donald Winnicott]] who promoted through [[Radio programming|radio broadcasts]] and in the [[Newspaper|press]] the idea of the home as a private emotional world in which mother and child are bound to each other and in which the mother has control and finds freedom to fulfill herself.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Finch | first1 = Janet | last2 = Summerfield | first2 = Penny | contribution = Social reconstruction and the emergence of companionate marriage, 1945\u201359 | editor-last = Clark | editor-first = David | title = Marriage, domestic life, and social change: writings for Jacqueline Burgoyne, 1944-88 | page = 11 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York, New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780415032469 | ref = harv | postscript = .| title-link = Jacqueline Burgoyne }}</ref>\n\n===Political and sexual roles===\nWomen's political roles grew in the 20th century after the first woman entered the House in 1919.

One notable event was the publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[Penguin Books]] in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive [[Mass marketing|mass-market]] [[paperback]] version prompted a court case. The prosecuting council's question, \"Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?\" highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen as one of the first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. Other elements of the [[sexual revolution]] included the development of [[The Pill]], [[Mary Quant]]'s [[miniskirt]] and the 1967 legalisation of [[homosexuality]]. There was a rise in the incidence of divorce and abortion, and a resurgence of the [[women's liberation movement]], whose campaigning helped secure the [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act]] and the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act]] in 1975.  The Irish Catholics, traditionally the most puritanical of the ethno-religious groups, eased up a little, especially as the membership disregarded the bishops teaching that contraception was sinful.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Geiringer | first = David | title = Catholic understandings of female sexuality in 1960s Britain | journal = 20th Century British History | volume =  28| issue =  2| pages =  209\u2013238| publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/tcbh/hww051 | pmid = 28922825 | date = November 2016 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==21st century==\nFrom 2007 to 2015, [[Harriet Harman]] was Deputy Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the UK's current opposition party.

The mutations are an important tool in understanding the relationship between two words and can differentiate various meanings.\n\nIrish, like [[Manx_language|Manx]] and colloquial Scottish Gaelic, uses two mutations on consonants: '''[[lenition]]''' ({{Lang-ga|s\u00e9imhi\u00fa}} [\u02c8\u0283e\u02d0.v\u02b2u\u02d0]) and '''[[Wiktionary:eclipsis|eclipsis]]''' ({{Lang|ga|ur\u00fa}} [\u02c8\u028a.\u027e\u02e0u\u02d0]) (the alternative names, ''aspiration'' for lenition and ''nasalisation'' for eclipsis, are also used, but those terms are misleading).\n\nOriginally these mutations were phonologically governed external [[sandhi]] effects: lenition was caused by a consonant being between two vowels, and eclipsis when a [[Nasalization|nasal]] preceded an [[obstruent]], including at the beginning of a word.\n\nThere are also two mutations, '''t-[[prothesis (linguistics)|prothesis]]''' and '''h-prothesis''', found on vowel-initial words.\n\nSee [[Irish phonology]] for a discussion of the symbols used on this page.\n\n==Lenition (s\u00e9imhi\u00fa)==\n\n===Effects of s\u00e9imhi\u00fa===\n# A stop becomes a fricative.

It is typically an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men.

Carey plays the role of Sheriff Cheyenne Harry. He saves Kitty Flanders from Pete McGuire and takes her safely home. McGuire hides in a shack on Mr. Flanders' stake and Harry's deputy is shot dead, apparently by Mr. Flanders. McGuire offers to keep quiet about the murder if Flanders gives him half a stake and his daughter's hand in marriage. Mr. Flanders confesses his crime to Sheriff Harry and learns that he is innocent. Sheriff Harry notices McGuire's gun and accuses him of the crime, but they are killed as they try to escape. The film concludes as Kitty Flanders confesses her love to Sheriff Cheyenne as she bandages his wounds from the fight.\n\nOriginally released in 1917, the film was later revised and re-titled as ''Sure-Shot Morgan''  and possibly released in 1919, and also re-released under both names in 1922. The film garnered little critic attention and the first summary of the film came from the two-reel revised release with a positive review. The film was directed by [[Fred Kelsey]] and released by [[Universal Film Manufacturing Company]]. The film's status is unknown.\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in the town of Driftwood, the film begins when Pete McGuire, known by the alias \"Lone Jack\" arrives in town and molests Kitty Flanders. Sheriff Cheyenne Harry intervenes and knocks down McGuire and takes Kitty Flanders to her home. McGuire becomes aware that Sheriff Harry's deputy, Horton, is out to arrest him and McGuire hides out on a shack on Flanders' claim. Horton is later killed, apparently by Mr. Flanders, and McGuire offers to keep quiet in exchange that he gives him half a stake in the claim and have Kitty Flanders marry him. Later, Sheriff Harry learns that Horton was killed by a 44-Calibre round. Mr. Flanders confesses to Sheriff Harry that he shot and killed Horton, but the sheriff points out that his gun was of a different size. Sheriff Harry notices that McGuire's gun is a 44-Calibre and accuses him of killing Horton. McGuire and an accomplice attempt to escape, but are killed by the Sheriff in a fight. Kitty Flanders confesses her love to Sheriff Cheyenne as she bandages his wounds.<ref name=reel>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/universal1516univ | title=Universal Weekly (1922) (1922) | publisher=Universal Pictures | date=1922 | accessdate=August 25, 2014 | pages=747}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|This plot summary comes from the two-reel revision as no account of the three-reel publication has been found from the original 1917 release in newspapers, trade publications or fan magazines.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite book | title=The Strong, Silent Type: Over 100 Screen Cowboys, 1903-1930 | publisher=McFarland | author=Rainey, Buck | year=2004 | pages=271}}</ref> as Sheriff Cheyenne Harry<ref name=tr />\n* [[Claire Du Brey]]<ref name=cast /> as Kitty Flanders\n* [[Hoot Gibson]]<ref name=cast />\n* [[Frank MacQuarrie]]<ref name=cast />\n* [[Vester Pegg]]<ref name=cast />\n* [[William Steele (actor)|William Steele]] credited as William Gettinger (Bill Gettinger)<ref name=cast />\n* Maude Emory <ref name=\"silentera\" />\n\n==Production and release==\nThe screen story originates from T.

Carey plays the role of Sheriff Cheyenne Harry. He saves Kitty Flanders from Pete McGuire and takes her safely home. McGuire hides in a shack on Mr. Flanders' stake and Harry's deputy is shot dead, apparently by Mr. Flanders. McGuire offers to keep quiet about the murder if Flanders gives him half a stake and his daughter's hand in marriage. Mr. Flanders confesses his crime to Sheriff Harry and learns that he is innocent. Sheriff Harry notices McGuire's gun and accuses him of the crime, but they are killed as they try to escape. The film concludes as Kitty Flanders confesses her love to Sheriff Cheyenne as she bandages his wounds from the fight.\n\nOriginally released in 1917, the film was later revised and re-titled as ''Sure-Shot Morgan''  and possibly released in 1919, and also re-released under both names in 1922. The film garnered little critic attention and the first summary of the film came from the two-reel revised release with a positive review. The film was directed by [[Fred Kelsey]] and released by [[Universal Film Manufacturing Company]]. The film's status is unknown.\n\n== Plot ==\nSet in the town of Driftwood, the film begins when Pete McGuire, known by the alias \"Lone Jack\" arrives in town and molests Kitty Flanders. Sheriff Cheyenne Harry intervenes and knocks down McGuire and takes Kitty Flanders to her home. McGuire becomes aware that Sheriff Harry's deputy, Horton, is out to arrest him and McGuire hides out on a shack on Flanders' claim. Horton is later killed, apparently by Mr. Flanders, and McGuire offers to keep quiet in exchange that he gives him half a stake in the claim and have Kitty Flanders marry him. Later, Sheriff Harry learns that Horton was killed by a 44-Calibre round. Mr. Flanders confesses to Sheriff Harry that he shot and killed Horton, but the sheriff points out that his gun was of a different size. Sheriff Harry notices that McGuire's gun is a 44-Calibre and accuses him of killing Horton. McGuire and an accomplice attempt to escape, but are killed by the Sheriff in a fight. Kitty Flanders confesses her love to Sheriff Cheyenne as she bandages his wounds.<ref name=reel>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/universal1516univ | title=Universal Weekly (1922) (1922) | publisher=Universal Pictures | date=1922 | accessdate=August 25, 2014 | pages=747}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|This plot summary comes from the two-reel revision as no account of the three-reel publication has been found from the original 1917 release in newspapers, trade publications or fan magazines.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]]<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite book | title=The Strong, Silent Type: Over 100 Screen Cowboys, 1903-1930 | publisher=McFarland | author=Rainey, Buck | year=2004 | pages=271}}</ref> as Sheriff Cheyenne Harry<ref name=tr />\n* [[Claire Du Brey]]<ref name=cast /> as Kitty Flanders\n* [[Hoot Gibson]]<ref name=cast />\n* [[Frank MacQuarrie]]<ref name=cast />\n* [[Vester Pegg]]<ref name=cast />\n* [[William Steele (actor)|William Steele]] credited as William Gettinger (Bill Gettinger)<ref name=cast />\n* Maude Emory <ref name=\"silentera\" />\n\n==Production and release==\nThe screen story originates from T.

It serves as a scaffold for [[cell plate]] assembly and subsequent formation of a new [[cell wall]] separating the two daughter cells. The phragmoplast can only be observed in [[Phragmoplastophyta]], a clade that includes the  [[Coleochaetophyceae]], [[Zygnematophyceae]], [[Mesotaeniaceae]] and [[Embryophyta]] (land plants). Some algae use another type of microtubule array, a [[phycoplast]], during cytokinesis.<ref name=\"Raven2005\">P.H. Raven, R.F. Evert, S.E. Eichhorn (2005): ''Biology of Plants'', 7th Edition, W.H.

It is initially barrel-shaped and forms from the [[mitotic spindle]] between the two daughter nuclei while [[nuclear envelope]]s reassemble around them. The cell plate initially forms as a disc between the two halves of the phragmoplast structure. While new cell plate material is added to the edges of the growing plate, the phragmoplast microtubules disappear in the center and regenerate at the edges of the growing cell plate. The two structures grow outwards until they reach the outer wall of the dividing cell. If a [[phragmosome]] was present in the cell, the phragmoplast and cell plate will grow through the space occupied by the phragmosome. They will reach the parent cell wall exactly at the position formerly occupied by the [[preprophase band]].\n\nThe microtubules and actin filaments within the phragmoplast serve to guide [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] with cell wall material to the growing cell plate. Actin filaments are also possibly involved in guiding the phragmoplast to the site of the former preprophase band location at the parent cell wall. While the cell plate is growing, segments of smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]] are trapped within it, later forming the [[plasmodesmata]] connecting the two daughter cells.\n\nThe phragmoplast can be differentiated topographically into two areas, the midline that includes the central plane where some of the plus-ends of both anti-parallel sets of microtubules (MTs) interdigitate (as in the midbody matrix), and the distal regions at both sides of the midline.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Otegui|first=Marisa S.|last2=Verbrugghe|first2=Koen J.|last3=Skop|first3=Ahna R.|date=August 2005|title=Midbodies and phragmoplasts: analogous structures involved in cytokinesis|journal=Trends in Cell Biology|volume=15|issue=8|pages=404\u2013413|doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2005.06.003|issn=0962-8924|pmc=3677513|pmid=16009554}}</ref>\n\n== Role in the Plant Cell Cycle ==\nAfter anaphase, the phragmoplast emerges from the remnant spindle MTs in between the daughter nuclei.

It serves as a scaffold for [[cell plate]] assembly and subsequent formation of a new [[cell wall]] separating the two daughter cells. The phragmoplast can only be observed in [[Phragmoplastophyta]], a clade that includes the  [[Coleochaetophyceae]], [[Zygnematophyceae]], [[Mesotaeniaceae]], and [[Embryophyta]] (land plants). Some algae use another type of microtubule array, a [[phycoplast]], during cytokinesis.<ref name=\"Raven2005\">P.H. Raven, R.F. Evert, S.E. Eichhorn (2005): ''Biology of Plants'', 7th Edition, W.H.

It is initially barrel-shaped and forms from the [[mitotic spindle]] between the two daughter nuclei while [[nuclear envelope]]s reassemble around them. The cell plate initially forms as a disc between the two halves of the phragmoplast structure. While new cell plate material is added to the edges of the growing plate, the phragmoplast microtubules disappear in the center and regenerate at the edges of the growing cell plate. The two structures grow outwards until they reach the outer wall of the dividing cell. If a [[phragmosome]] was present in the cell, the phragmoplast and cell plate will grow through the space occupied by the phragmosome. They will reach the parent cell wall exactly at the position formerly occupied by the [[preprophase band]].\n\nThe microtubules and actin filaments within the phragmoplast serve to guide [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] with cell wall material to the growing cell plate. Actin filaments are also possibly involved in guiding the phragmoplast to the site of the former preprophase band location at the parent cell wall. While the cell plate is growing, segments of smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]] are trapped within it, later forming the [[plasmodesmata]] connecting the two daughter cells.\n\nThe phragmoplast can be differentiated topographically into two areas, the midline that includes the central plane where some of the plus-ends of both anti-parallel sets of microtubules (MTs) interdigitate (as in the midbody matrix), and the distal regions at both sides of the midline.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Otegui|first=Marisa S.|last2=Verbrugghe|first2=Koen J.|last3=Skop|first3=Ahna R.|date=August 2005|title=Midbodies and phragmoplasts: analogous structures involved in cytokinesis|journal=Trends in Cell Biology|volume=15|issue=8|pages=404\u2013413|doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2005.06.003|issn=0962-8924|pmc=3677513|pmid=16009554}}</ref>\n\n== Role in the Plant Cell Cycle ==\nAfter anaphase, the phragmoplast emerges from the remnant spindle MTs in between the daughter nuclei.
