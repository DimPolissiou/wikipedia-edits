The WDS-6 is used all over India.\n\n==History==\nThe class was created in 1975 to address the need for powerful shunting locomotive that will be able to haul 20-24 coach rakes. The previous WDS-4 class was underpowered for this kind of operation. The WDS-6 locos consist of the [[YDM-4]] powerpack (6-cylinder 4-stroke inline Alco engine, turbo-supercharged) placed on [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] frames.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge]] (W), '''D'''iesel (D), '''S'''hunting  (S) engine. The WDS-6 is used all over India.\n\n==History==\nThe class was created in 1975 to address the need for powerful shunting locomotive that will be able to haul 20-24 coach rakes. The previous WDS-4 class was underpowered for this kind of operation. The WDS-6 locos consist of the [[YDM-4]] powerpack (6-cylinder 4-stroke inline Alco engine, turbo-supercharged) placed on [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] frames. They were manufactured by [[Diesel Locomotive Works|DLW varanasi]] and later Parel Workshops started building them using the kits provided by DLW.\nThe WDS-6 can easily be recognized by their shot nose and flat-ended cab at one end. They were sold and transferred to industrial concerns and public sectors in huge numbers, but have IR road numbers on them.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDS-6/AD locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Bardhaman railway station|Bardhaman]]- 2\n* [[Bokaro Steel City railway station|Bokaro Steel City]]- 10\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]]- 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]]- 6\n* [[Gonda, Uttar Pradesh|Gonda]]- 4\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Guntakal|Guntakal]]- 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]]- 12\n* [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]]- 18\n* [[Itarsi Junction railway station|Itarsi]]- 17\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]]- 2\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]]- 11\n* [[Katni railway station|Katni]]- 3\n* [[Kazipet railway station|Kazipet]]- 1\n* [[Krishnarajapuram railway station|Krishnarajapuram]]- 3 \n* [[Lucknow Charbagh railway station|Lucknow]]- 4\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]]- 13\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]]- 1\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]]- 20\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ratlam|Ratlam]]- 6\n* [[Shakur Basti (Delhi Assembly constituency)|Shakurbasti]]- 21\n* [[Tughlakabad railway station|Tughlakabad]]- 12\n* [[Vatva (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Vatva]]- 17\n* [[Vijayawada Junction railway station|Vijayawada]]- 5\n* [[Visakhapatnam railway station|Visakhapatnam]]- 10\n*'''Loco Shed Izzatnagar-''' 1\n*'''Loco Shed Unknown-'''  13\n*'''Loco Shed Kharagpur-''' 17\n*'''Loco Shed Kurla-''' 51\n*'''Loco Shed Bondamunda-''' 8\n*'''Loco Shed Beliaghata Sealdah-''' 27\n*'''Loco Shed Andal-''' 6\n*'''Loco Shed Bandra Marshalling Yard-'''  22\n*'''Loco Shed Gandhidham-''' 5\n*'''Loco Shed Patratu-''' 5\n*'''Loco Shed Ludhiana-''' 3\n*'''Loco Shed Tondiarpet-''' 18  <br />\n'''Total active Locomotives in service till April 2020:''' 375\n}}\n'''Source-'''https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named\n\n== Technical specifications ==\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|DLW, Parel Workshop\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-D, [[Straight-six engine|Inline-6]], {{convert|1,400|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|1,300|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco turbocharged engine. 1,100&nbsp;rpm max, 400&nbsp;rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|267|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.\n|-\n|Transmission\n|Electric, DC-DC (DC Generator and DC Traction motor) \n|-\n|[[Traction motor]]s\n|GE for original Alco and MLW models, BHEL for DLW\n|-\n|-\n|[[Axle load]]\n|{{convert|21|t|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|total weight\n|{{convert|113|t|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|[[Bogie]]s\n|Alco design cast frame trimount ([[Co-Co engine|Co-Co]]) bogies \n|-\n|Starting TE\n|{{convert|34|t|abbr=on}}, at adhesion 27%\n|-\n|Length over [[buffer beam]]s\n|{{convert|17,370|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Distance between [[bogie]]s\n|{{convert|10,516|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|}\n==Other Shunting Locomotives of Indian Railway==\n'''WDS-2:''' 30 produced - All are out of Service.<br />\n'''WDS-4:''' 662 produced - 11 are active in service.<br />\n'''WDS-5:''' 21 produced - 4 are active in service. <br />\n<br />'''Source-''' https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[History of rail transport in India]]\n* [[Locomotives of India]]\n* [[Rail transport in India]]\n* [[YDM-4|Indian locomotive class YDM-4]]\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Hughes-IndianLocos4}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*https://rdso.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/File/WDS6.PDF\n*https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html\n*https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html#WDS-6\n*https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list\n{{commons category|Indian locomotive class WDS6}}\n\n{{Broad gauge locomotives of India |state=open}}\n\n[[Category:Diesel-electric locomotives of India]]\n[[Category:Co-Co locomotives]]\n[[Category:DLW locomotives]]\n[[Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1975]]\n[[Category:5 ft 6 in gauge locomotives]]\n", "name_user": "Suvadeep Saha56", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSome of the sheds holding WDS-6/AD locomotives:Updated information.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_locomotive_class_WDS-6"}

She is best known for her time spent in the [[Women's National Basketball League]] (WNBL), but has also spent time in England, Portugal, Russia and Italy. She has also played [[wheelchair basketball]] with the [[Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League]] (WNWBL). She was the first player to play in both the WNBL and WNWBL.\n\n==Career==\nEmerging with the [[Australian Institute of Sport (WNBL team)|Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) in the late 1990s, winning the 1999 [[Women's National Basketball League]] (WNBL) championship alongside the likes of [[Lauren Jackson]] and [[Penny Taylor]], Smith came into her own at the Adelaide Lightning. It was in South Australia where she  thrived under the added responsibility, producing impressive seasons before making the move west to join the Perth Lynx in 2005. Here, Smith joined the WNBL elite, posting career-high numbers (21.7 ppg) and earning selection to the [[Australia women's national basketball team|Australian Opals]].\n\n[[File:Sydney Basketball - Deanna Smith.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Smith with the Be Active Western Stars in 2013]]\n\nSmith got her first taste of overseas basketball in 2004 with the Manchester Mystics in the British League before returning to Europe in 2006, joining Portuguese team CAB Madeira \u2013 winning the league title in her first season. Smith returned to the WNBL and the Lynx in 2008, earning her second All-Star Five honour before repeating the dose in the 2009\u201310 season at the Sydney Uni Flames. However, injuries began to tether her career in later years, as she was sidelined for the entire 2010\u201311 campaign. She had another impressive season at the Bendigo Spirit in 2011\u201312, but injury again ravaged Smith in 2012\u201313 with the [[Perth Lynx|West Coast Waves]], restricting her to just six games after setting the competition alight, winning the MVP at the 2012 WNBL Pre-Season Tournament.

She is best known for her time spent in the [[Women's National Basketball League]] (WNBL), but has also spent time in England, Portugal, Russia and Italy. She has also played [[wheelchair basketball]] with the [[Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League]] (WNWBL). She was the first player to play in both the WNBL and WNWBL.\n\n==Career==\nEmerging with the [[Australian Institute of Sport (WNBL team)|Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) in the late 1990s, winning the 1999 [[Women's National Basketball League]] (WNBL) championship alongside the likes of [[Lauren Jackson]] and [[Penny Taylor]], Smith came into her own at the Adelaide Lightning. It was in South Australia where she  thrived under the added responsibility, producing impressive seasons before making the move west to join the Perth Lynx in 2005. Here, Smith joined the WNBL elite, posting career-high numbers (21.7 ppg) and earning selection to the [[Australia women's national basketball team|Australian Opals]].\n\n[[File:Sydney Basketball - Deanna Smith.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Smith with the Be Active Western Stars in 2013]]\n\nSmith got her first taste of overseas basketball in 2004 with the Manchester Mystics in the British League before returning to Europe in 2006, joining Portuguese team CAB Madeira \u2013 winning the league title in her first season. Smith returned to the WNBL and the Lynx in 2008, earning her second All-Star Five honour before repeating the dose in the 2009\u201310 season at the Sydney Uni Flames. However, injuries began to tether her career in later years, as she was sidelined for the entire 2010\u201311 campaign. She had another impressive season at the Bendigo Spirit in 2011\u201312, but injury again ravaged Smith in 2012\u201313 with the [[Perth Lynx|West Coast Waves]], restricting her to just six games after setting the competition alight, winning the MVP at the 2012 WNBL Pre-Season Tournament. Having managed only half-a-dozen games in 2012\u201313 due to a foot fracture, Smith made just three appearances in 2013\u201314 before suffering a cartilage tear in her knee.<ref>[http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/basketball/fitagain-veteran-deanna-smith-set-to-revitalise-west-coast-waves/news-story/7522a82ec3871624c866583a28caf814 Fit-again veteran Deanna Smith set to revitalise West Coast Waves]</ref> She came back strong in 2014\u201315, averaging 11.8 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 20 games for a dismal Waves team that won just four games during the season.\n\nSmith has also played for multiple state league teams over her career.

Lincoln was a [[bellwether]] between 1974 and 2017. The seat bucked the national Conservative victory in 1970 by electing a Labour MP, as it did in 2017.\n\nThe seat has been considered relative to others an ultra-marginal seat, as well as a swing seat, since 2005 as its winner's majority has not exceeded 3.2% of the vote since the 12.5% majority won in 2005 and the seat has changed hands three times since that year.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The County Borough of Lincoln, and the Urban District of Bracebridge.\n\n'''1950\u20131974''': The County Borough of Lincoln.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven wards of Bracebridge Heath, North Hykeham Central, North Hykeham North, North Hykeham South, Skellingthorpe, and Waddington West.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven ward of Bracebridge Heath.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven wards of Bracebridge Heath and Waddington East, and Skellingthorpe.\n\nThe constituency, as its name suggests, covers the [[cathedral city]]{{#tag:ref|[[Lincoln Cathedral]] was from 1311 until an intense storm in 1549 [[List of tallest church buildings in the world|the world's tallest building]] |group= n}} of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] in [[Lincolnshire]], and most of its directly adjoining villages.\n\n==History==\nLincoln first sent Members to Parliament in 1265, thirty years before the first all-over coverage of cities and qualifying towns was introduced in the [[Model Parliament]], and has done so ever since, although no records exist from before the end of the 13th century. The early elections were held at the Guildhall and the [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es elected were usually officials of the borough.\n\nThe representation, originally two Members (\"burgesses\"), was reduced to one Member in 1885.\n\nThe seat was represented for five years by former Cabinet minister [[Margaret Beckett|Margaret Jackson, later Margaret Beckett]].{{#tag:ref|Changed seat in 1983 to serve [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]] which she has held to date (winning most recently in 2017)|group= n}} Lincoln became the oldest constituency in the country in 2010 when the [[City of York (UK Parliament constituency)|City of York constituency]] was divided.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nThe seat includes the [[University of Lincoln]]. From 1945 to 1972 Lincoln was continuously held by the Labour Party, often as a [[safe seat]]. The city has good transport links with [[Nottingham]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and the smaller ancient market towns in Lincolnshire, such as [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], [[Market Rasen]] and [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]]. Lincoln was a [[bellwether constituency]] from October 1974 to [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], voting for the party which would form the government in each election. In [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] Labour took the seat despite being the 2nd largest party nationwide.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n===MPs 1265\u20131660===\n{|

The seat bucked the national Conservative victory in 1970 by electing a Labour MP, as it did in 2017.\n\nThe seat has been considered relative to others an ultra-marginal seat, as well as a swing seat, since 2005 as its winner's majority has not exceeded 3.2% of the vote since the 12.5% majority won in 2005 and the seat has changed hands three times since that year.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918\u20131950''': The County Borough of Lincoln, and the Urban District of Bracebridge.\n\n'''1950\u20131974''': The County Borough of Lincoln.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': As prior but with redrawn boundaries.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven wards of Bracebridge Heath, North Hykeham Central, North Hykeham North, North Hykeham South, Skellingthorpe, and Waddington West.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven ward of Bracebridge Heath.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The City of Lincoln, and the District of North Kesteven wards of Bracebridge Heath and Waddington East, and Skellingthorpe.\n\nThe constituency, as its name suggests, covers the [[cathedral city]]{{#tag:ref|[[Lincoln Cathedral]] was from 1311 until an intense storm in 1549 [[List of tallest church buildings in the world|the world's tallest building]] |group= n}} of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] in [[Lincolnshire]], and most of its directly adjoining villages.\n\n==History==\nLincoln first sent Members to Parliament in 1265, thirty years before the first all-over coverage of cities and qualifying towns was introduced in the [[Model Parliament]], and has done so ever since, although no records exist from before the end of the 13th century. The early elections were held at the Guildhall and the [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es elected were usually officials of the borough.\n\nThe representation, originally two Members (\"burgesses\"), was reduced to one Member in 1885.\n\nThe seat was represented for five years by former Cabinet minister [[Margaret Beckett|Margaret Jackson, later Margaret Beckett]].{{#tag:ref|Changed seat in 1983 to serve [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]] which she has held to date (winning most recently in 2017)|group= n}} Lincoln became the oldest constituency in the country in 2010 when the [[City of York (UK Parliament constituency)|City of York constituency]] was divided.\n\n==Constituency profile==\nThe seat includes the [[University of Lincoln]]. From 1945 to 1972 Lincoln was continuously held by the Labour Party, often as a [[safe seat]]. The city has good transport links with [[Nottingham]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and the smaller ancient market towns in Lincolnshire, such as [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], [[Market Rasen]] and [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]]. Lincoln was a [[bellwether constituency]] from October 1974 to [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], voting for the party which would form the government in each election. In [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]] Labour took the seat despite being the 2nd largest party nationwide.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n===MPs 1265\u20131660===\n{|

The location had space for 100 vehicles over seven floors, totaling 19,000 square feet. The same company opened a second location in 1902 for 230 vehicles. The company specialized in the sale, storage, valeting and on-demand delivery of electric vehicles that could travel about 40 miles and had a top speed of 20 miles per hour.\n\nThe earliest known parking garage in the United States was built in 1918 for the Hotel La Salle at 215 West Washington Street in the West Loop area of downtown Chicago, Illinois.

At nearly 20 stories and over {{convert|200|ft|m}}, it is an exceptionally large car park that comprises a significant portion of the building.]]\n[[File:Free Parking.jpg|thumb|right|The inside of a multi-storey car park]]\n[[File:Motorcycle parking.jpg|thumb|left|Motorcycle parking inside a multi-storey car park]]\n\nThe movement of vehicles between floors can take place by means of:\n\n* interior [[Inclined plane|ramp]]s \u2013 the most common type\n* exterior ramps \u2013 which may take the form of a circular ramp (colloquially known as a 'whirley-gig' in America)\n* vehicle [[Elevator|lifts]] (or elevators) \u2013 the least common\n* automated robot systems \u2013 combination of ramp and elevator\n\nWhere the car park is built on sloping land, it may be [[split-level]] or have sloped parking.\n\nMany car parks are independent buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often less than the office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55\u201360 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either [[prestressed concrete]] [[double-tee]] floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.\n\nIn recent times, car parks built to serve residential and some business properties have been built as part of a larger building, often underground as part of the basement, such as the parking lot at the [[Atlantic Station]] redevelopment in [[Atlanta]].  This saves land for other uses (as opposed to a car park), is cheaper and more practical in most cases than a separate structure, and is hidden from view.  It protects customers and their cars from weather such as rain, snow, or hot summer sunshine that raises a vehicle's interior temperature to extremely high levels. Underground parking of only two levels was considered an innovative concept in 1964, when developer [[Louis Lesser]] developed a two-level underground parking structure under six 10-storey high-rise residential halls at [[California State University, Los Angeles]], which lacked space for horizontal expansion in the {{convert|176|acre|km2|adj=on}} university.  The simple two-level parking structure was considered unusual enough in 1964 that a separate newspaper section entitled \"Parking Underground\" described the parking lot as an innovative \"concept\" and as \"subterranean spaces\".<ref name=\"LAT25Jun63\">Los Angeles Times, 25 June 1963, \"High Rise Developer Defends Loss of View to Convenience\"</ref><ref name=\"LAT15Mar64\">Los Angeles Times, 15 March 1964, Tom Cameron, \"$118&nbsp;Million Going into Expansion at L.A. State\"</ref> In [[Toronto]], a 2,400 space parking lot below [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is one of the world's largest.\n\nCar parks which serve shopping centres can be built adjacent to the centre for easier access at each floor between shops and parking. One example is [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], USA, which has two large parking lots attached to the building, at the eastern and western ends. A common position for car parks within shopping centres in the UK is on the roof, around the various utility systems, enabling customers to take lifts straight down into the centre. Examples of such are [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Festival Place]] in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nThese car parks often have low ceiling clearances, which restrict access by [[full-size van]]s and other large vehicles. On 15 December 2013, a man was killed during a robbery in the parking garage at [[The Mall at Short Hills]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]]. The paramedics responding to the shooting were delayed because their ambulance was too large to enter the structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2014/01/short_hills_carjacking_911s_wifes_call.html|title='Where is it?'

[[Expansion joint]]s are used between sections not only for thermal expansion but to accommodate the flexing of the structure's sections due to vehicle traffic.  [[Seismic retrofit]]s can be applied where earthquakes are an issue.\n\nSome parking structures have partly collapsed, either during construction or years later.  In July 2009 a fourth-floor section failed at the [[Centergy]] building in [[midtown Atlanta]], pancaking down and destroying more than 30 vehicles but injuring no-one.  In December 2007, a car crashed into the wall of the deck at the [[SouthPark Mall (Charlotte, North Carolina)|SouthPark Mall]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], weakening it and causing a small collapse which destroyed two cars below.  On the same day, one under construction in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] collapsed as concrete was being poured on the sixth floor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,315587,00.html|title=North Carolina Parking Deck Collapse Kills 1|date=6 December 2007|publisher=Fox News}}</ref> In November 2008, the sudden collapse of the middle level of a deck in [[Montreal]] was preceded by warning signs some weeks before, including cracks and water leaks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/man-dies-after-montreal-parking-garage-roof-collapses-1.736057|title=Man dies after Montreal parking garage roof collapses|date=26 November 2008|work=CBC News}}</ref> Parking structures are generally not subject to [[building inspection]]s after being checked for their initial [[occupancy permit]].\n\nIn October 2012 four people were killed and nine more injured when a parking structure under construction at a campus of [[Miami-Dade College]] in Florida collapsed,<ref name=\"mdc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mdc.edu/main/thereporter/archive/vol03-05/news/four_dead_several_injured_after_parking_.aspx|title=Four Dead, Several Injured After Parking Garage Collapses at West Campus|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Miami-Dade College|author=Castillo, Gregory|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref> purportedly due to an unfinished column.<ref name=\"huffpostmiami\">{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/miami-college-parking-garage-collapse_n_2979021.html|title=Miami Dade College Parking Garage Collapsed Due To Unfinished Column: Lawyer|date=29 March 2013|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Precast parking structures===\n[[File:Precast parking structure.jpg|thumb|right|Precast parking structure showing an interior column, girders and double-tee structural floors. The two gray circles are covers to close the lifting anchor holes.]]\n\nAs multi-story car parks have become more common since the middle of the twentieth century, many constructions of such structures have been using [[precast concrete]] to reduce the construction time. The design involves putting parking structure parts together. The parts of precast concrete include multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, [[girder]]s, wall panels, stairs and slabs. The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using [[precast concrete lifting anchor system]]s at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include using of covers to close the holes in the precast concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing [[facade]]s to the exterior of the structures.\n\nIn modern construction of the precast modules, there are other features to improve the strength of the structure. An example is to use [[Prestressed concrete|prestressed strands]] on post-tensioned concrete for the construction of the [[shear wall]]s. Another example is the use of [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] to replace steel wire mesh to lighten the load and yield more corrosion resistant especially for the cold-climate areas which use salt for melting snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/resources/technical/upload/Hi_ParkBro_18.pdf|title=High Precast Parking Systems|publisher=High Concrete Group|accessdate=3 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513042257/http://www.highconcrete.com/resources/technical/upload/Hi_ParkBro_18.pdf|archive-date=13 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Architectural value===\n[[File:1111 Lincoln Road at night.jpg|thumb|The [[1111 Lincoln Road]] parking garage]]\nThese structures are not usually known for their architectural value.

G stands for ground and x for the number of floors above ground. For example, G+5 is a multi-story car park structure with a ground floor and 5 floors above that, i.e. a total of 6 floors.\n\n==Construction types==\n* Concrete \n* Steel structure\n* Automated (mechanical)\n\n===Steel structure===\nStructure car parks are car parks made of structural steel components connected to each other to carry the loads and provide full structural rigidity.\n\nSteel is a high-strength material requiring less material than other types of structures like concrete and timber. Steel construction features:\n* Cost savings: inexpensive to manufacture and erect, and requires less maintenance than traditional building methods.\n* Speed: Allows construction/prefabrication off-site with rapid installation on-site. Some suppliers claim construction in days.\n* Durability: Suppliers claim 50-plus years lifespan.\n* Removability: Steel car park structure could be designed to be removed at a later date.\n* Expandability: Steel car park structures can be expanded easily at a later date.\n* Creativity: Steel allows for long column-free spans.\n\nThe ceiling slab of the steel structure car park is typically made of composite material such as corrugated steel sheets and concrete. The surface of the first-floor parking can be left bare or covered with epoxy or tarmac.\n\n===Foundationless and modular===\n\nDemand, steel features, and innovation have led to the development of a foundationless, modular, removable steel car park structure.\n\nParking demand often grows quickly, significantly and sometimes unexpectedly.  Modular steel car parks could be the proper solution if the surface area available is not sufficient and can be expanded upwards, or whenever it is not feasible to build up a multi-story parking.\nThe development of the building concept of modular car parks came about by using the modular assembling method of vertical and horizontal elements (such as columns and beams)\nModular car park structures are versatile and can be built in phases or in different sizes and shape.\nThe solution makes it possible to develop a parking structure even in case of particular conditions or constraints, such as archaeological sites or city centres, because it allows:\n* To virtually double the parking surface without leaving any footprint on the ground, as no settlement for excavations or traditional foundations is needed;\n* To double the parking surface by means of a light steel single-deck car park system.\n* Prefab modular components of the system make each project versatile and suitable for both large and small sized areas.\n\nThese parking structures are generally demountable and can be relocated to avoid making the choice of converting a surface to parking area irrevocably. They could be used as permanent structures or are conceived as temporary parking facilities for temporary parking demand needs. A number of parking decks have been demounted after a few years \u2013 to make room for the development of a permanent structure \u2013 and relocated to respond to local parking demand.\n\n==Automated parking==\n{{main|Automated parking system}}\n{{distinguish|text=[[Automatic parking]], a self-parking feature in a car}}\n[[File:Automatic-Underground-Car-Storage-Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|Automatic underground car storage in [[Thessaloniki]], Greece]]\nThe earliest use of an [[automated parking system]] (APS) was in Paris in 1905 at the Garage Rue de Ponthieu.<ref name=\"McDonald-2012\">Sanders McDonald, Shannon.[http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2012_112_Cars_Parking_Sustain.pdf \"Cars, Parking and Sustainability\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810141139/http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2012_112_Cars_Parking_Sustain.pdf |date=10 August 2013 }}, ''The Transportation Research Forum http://www.trforum.org/''.Retrieved on 16 October 2012.</ref> The APS consisted of a groundbreaking<ref name=\"McDonald-2012\" /> multi-story concrete structure with an internal elevator to transport cars to upper levels where attendants parked the cars.<ref name=Hamelink>{{Citation\n | title = The Mechanical Parking Guide 2011\n | year = 2011\n | author = Hamelink, Ir.

The cost of the mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs to be added to the building cost. In addition, operation and maintenance costs of the mechanical equipment need to be added in order to determine the total cost of ownership. Other costs could be saved, for example, there is no need for an energy-intensive [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilating system]], since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed. For naturally ventilated car parks structures, the ventilation equipment is not needed.\n\nAutomated car parks rely on similar technology to that used for mechanical handling and document retrieval. The driver leaves the car in an entrance module, and it is then transported to a parking slot by a robotic [[flatbed trolley|trolley]]. For the driver, the process of parking is reduced to leaving the car inside an entrance module.\n\nAt peak periods a wait may occur before entering or leaving, because loading passengers and luggage occurs at the entrance and exit rather than at the parking stall. This loading blocks the entrance or exit from being available to others. It is generally not recommended to use automated car parks for high peak hour volume facilities.\n\nAdditional factors that need to be taken into consideration are:\n* Fear of breakdowns (How does the user get the car back)\n* Maintenance contracts needed with suppliers\n\n== Other technologies==\n{{See also|Parking guidance and information|Parking lot}}\n[[File:Car park sensor.jpg|thumb|[[Ultrasonic sensor|Ultrasonic]] [[sensor]]s above each lot in this indoor car park determine if a car has already taken the lot and indicate using [[LED]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keytop.en.alibaba.com/product/513301802-209897983/led_lamps_for_parking_car_parking_space_led_indicator.html|title=parking sensor indicator/parking space indicator/led parking lot lighting, View car parking led indicator, KEYOP Product Details from Xiamen Keytop Communication & Technology Company Limited on Alibaba.com|accessdate=24 November 2016}}</ref> and some can send a [[Bluetooth]]/[[Short Message Service|SMS]] message with the parking space number or code.]]\n\nModern car parks utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, [[car location]] when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience.

The location had space for 100 vehicles over seven floors, totaling 19,000 square feet. The same company opened a second location in 1902 for 230 vehicles. The company specialized in the sale, storage, valeting and on-demand delivery of electric vehicles that could travel about 40 miles and had a top speed of 20 miles per hour.\n\nThe earliest known parking garage in the United States was built in 1918 for the Hotel La Salle at 215 West Washington Street in the West Loop area of downtown Chicago, Illinois.

The design loads for car parks are often less than the office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55\u201360 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either [[prestressed concrete]] [[double-tee]] floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.\n\nIn recent times, car parks built to serve residential and some business properties have been built as part of a larger building, often underground as part of the basement, such as the parking lot at the [[Atlantic Station]] redevelopment in [[Atlanta]].  This saves land for other uses (as opposed to a car park), is cheaper and more practical in most cases than a separate structure, and is hidden from view.  It protects customers and their cars from weather such as rain, snow, or hot summer sunshine that raises a vehicle's interior temperature to extremely high levels. Underground parking of only two levels was considered an innovative concept in 1964, when developer [[Louis Lesser]] developed a two-level underground parking structure under six 10-storey high-rise residential halls at [[California State University, Los Angeles]], which lacked space for horizontal expansion in the {{convert|176|acre|km2|adj=on}} university.  The simple two-level parking structure was considered unusual enough in 1964 that a separate newspaper section entitled \"Parking Underground\" described the parking lot as an innovative \"concept\" and as \"subterranean spaces\".<ref name=\"LAT25Jun63\">Los Angeles Times, 25 June 1963, \"High Rise Developer Defends Loss of View to Convenience\"</ref><ref name=\"LAT15Mar64\">Los Angeles Times, 15 March 1964, Tom Cameron, \"$118&nbsp;Million Going into Expansion at L.A. State\"</ref> In [[Toronto]], a 2,400 space parking lot below [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is one of the world's largest.\n\nCar parks which serve shopping centres can be built adjacent to the centre for easier access at each floor between shops and parking. One example is [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], USA, which has two large parking lots attached to the building, at the eastern and western ends. A common position for car parks within shopping centres in the UK is on the roof, around the various utility systems, enabling customers to take lifts straight down into the centre. Examples of such are [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Festival Place]] in [[Basingstoke]].\n\nThese car parks often have low ceiling clearances, which restrict access by [[full-size van]]s and other large vehicles. On 15 December 2013, a man was killed during a robbery in the parking garage at [[The Mall at Short Hills]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]]. The paramedics responding to the shooting were delayed because their ambulance was too large to enter the structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2014/01/short_hills_carjacking_911s_wifes_call.html|title='Where is it?'

[[Expansion joint]]s are used between sections not only for thermal expansion but to accommodate the flexing of the structure's sections due to vehicle traffic.  [[Seismic retrofit]]s can be applied where earthquakes are an issue.\n\nSome parking structures have partly collapsed, either during construction or years later.  In July 2009 a fourth-floor section failed at the [[Centergy]] building in [[midtown Atlanta]], pancaking down and destroying more than 30 vehicles but injuring no-one.  In December 2007, a car crashed into the wall of the deck at the [[SouthPark Mall (Charlotte, North Carolina)|SouthPark Mall]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], weakening it and causing a small collapse which destroyed two cars below.

The two gray circles are covers to close the lifting anchor holes.]]\n\nAs multi-story car parks have become more common since the middle of the twentieth century, many constructions of such structures have been using [[precast concrete]] to reduce the construction time. The design involves putting parking structure parts together. The parts of precast concrete include multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, [[girder]]s, wall panels, stairs and slabs. The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using [[precast concrete lifting anchor system]]s at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include using of covers to close the holes in the precast concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing [[facade]]s to the exterior of the structures.\n\nIn modern construction of the precast modules, there are other features to improve the strength of the structure. An example is to use [[Prestressed concrete|prestressed strands]] on post-tensioned concrete for the construction of the [[shear wall]]s. Another example is the use of [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] to replace steel wire mesh to lighten the load and yield more corrosion resistant especially for the cold-climate areas which use salt for melting snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/resources/technical/upload/Hi_ParkBro_18.pdf|title=High Precast Parking Systems|publisher=High Concrete Group|accessdate=3 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513042257/http://www.highconcrete.com/resources/technical/upload/Hi_ParkBro_18.pdf|archive-date=13 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Architectural value===\n[[File:1111 Lincoln Road at night.jpg|thumb|The [[1111 Lincoln Road]] parking garage]]\nThese structures are not usually known for their architectural value.

G stands for ground and x for the number of floors above ground. For example, G+5 is a multi-story car park structure with a ground floor and 5 floors above that, i.e. a total of 6 floors.\n\n==Construction types==\n* Concrete \n* Steel structure\n* Automated (mechanical)\n\n===Steel structure===\nStructure car parks are car parks made of structural steel components connected to each other to carry the loads and provide full structural rigidity.\n\nSteel is a high-strength material requiring less material than other types of structures like concrete and timber. Steel construction features:\n* Cost savings: inexpensive to manufacture and erect, and requires less maintenance than traditional building methods.\n* Speed: Allows construction/prefabrication off-site with rapid installation on-site. Some suppliers claim construction in days.\n* Durability: Suppliers claim 50-plus years lifespan.\n* Removability: Steel car park structure could be designed to be removed at a later date.\n* Expandability: Steel car park structures can be expanded easily at a later date.\n* Creativity: Steel allows for long column-free spans.\n\nThe ceiling slab of the steel structure car park is typically made of composite material such as corrugated steel sheets and concrete. The surface of the first-floor parking can be left bare or covered with epoxy or tarmac.\n\n===Foundationless and modular===\n\nDemand, steel features, and innovation have led to the development of a foundationless, modular, removable steel car park structure.\n\nParking demand often grows quickly, significantly and sometimes unexpectedly.  Modular steel car parks could be the proper solution if the surface area available is not sufficient and can be expanded upwards, or whenever it is not feasible to build up a multi-story parking.\nThe development of the building concept of modular car parks came about by using the modular assembling method of vertical and horizontal elements (such as columns and beams)\nModular car park structures are versatile and can be built in phases or in different sizes and shape.\nThe solution makes it possible to develop a parking structure even in case of particular conditions or constraints, such as archaeological sites or city centres, because it allows:\n* To virtually double the parking surface without leaving any footprint on the ground, as no settlement for excavations or traditional foundations is needed;\n* To double the parking surface by means of a light steel single-deck car park system.\n* Prefab modular components of the system make each project versatile and suitable for both large and small sized areas.\n\nThese parking structures are generally demountable and can be relocated to avoid making the choice of converting a surface to parking area irrevocably. They could be used as permanent structures or are conceived as temporary parking facilities for temporary parking demand needs. A number of parking decks have been demounted after a few years \u2013 to make room for the development of a permanent structure \u2013 and relocated to respond to local parking demand.\n\n==Automated parking==\n{{main|Automated parking system}}\n{{distinguish|text=[[Automatic parking]], a self-parking feature in a car}}\n[[File:Automatic-Underground-Car-Storage-Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|Automatic underground car storage in [[Thessaloniki]], Greece]]\nThe earliest use of an [[automated parking system]] (APS) was in Paris in 1905 at the Garage Rue de Ponthieu.<ref name=\"McDonald-2012\">Sanders McDonald, Shannon.[http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2012_112_Cars_Parking_Sustain.pdf \"Cars, Parking and Sustainability\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810141139/http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2012_112_Cars_Parking_Sustain.pdf |date=10 August 2013 }}, ''The Transportation Research Forum http://www.trforum.org/''.Retrieved on 16 October 2012.</ref> The APS consisted of a groundbreaking<ref name=\"McDonald-2012\" /> multi-story concrete structure with an internal elevator to transport cars to upper levels where attendants parked the cars.<ref name=Hamelink>{{Citation\n | title = The Mechanical Parking Guide 2011\n | year = 2011\n | author = Hamelink, Ir.

The cost of the mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs to be added to the building cost. In addition, operation and maintenance costs of the mechanical equipment need to be added in order to determine the total cost of ownership. Other costs could be saved, for example, there is no need for an energy-intensive [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilating system]], since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed. For naturally ventilated car parks structures, the ventilation equipment is not needed.\n\nAutomated car parks rely on similar technology to that used for mechanical handling and document retrieval. The driver leaves the car in an entrance module, and it is then transported to a parking slot by a robotic [[flatbed trolley|trolley]]. For the driver, the process of parking is reduced to leaving the car inside an entrance module.\n\nAt peak periods a wait may occur before entering or leaving, because loading passengers and luggage occurs at the entrance and exit rather than at the parking stall. This loading blocks the entrance or exit from being available to others. It is generally not recommended to use automated car parks for high peak hour volume facilities.\n\nAdditional factors that need to be taken into consideration are:\n* Fear of breakdowns (How does the user get the car back)\n* Maintenance contracts needed with suppliers\n\n== Other technologies==\n{{See also|Parking guidance and information|Parking lot}}\n[[File:Car park sensor.jpg|thumb|[[Ultrasonic sensor|Ultrasonic]] [[sensor]]s above each lot in this indoor car park determine if a car has already taken the lot and indicate using [[LED]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://keytop.en.alibaba.com/product/513301802-209897983/led_lamps_for_parking_car_parking_space_led_indicator.html|title=parking sensor indicator/parking space indicator/led parking lot lighting, View car parking led indicator, KEYOP Product Details from Xiamen Keytop Communication & Technology Company Limited on Alibaba.com|accessdate=24 November 2016}}</ref> and some can send a [[Bluetooth]]/[[Short Message Service|SMS]] message with the parking space number or code.]]\n\nModern car parks utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, [[car location]] when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience.

It lies west of the [[Mississippi River]] tallgrass prairie in the United States and east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the U.S. and Canada. It encompasses:\n\n* The entirety of [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]\n\n* Parts of [[Colorado]], [[Montana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Kansas]]\n\n* The southern portions of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]] \n\nThe region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. The Canadian portion of the Plains is known as the [[Canadian Prairies]]. It covers much of Alberta and southern Saskatchewan, and a narrow band of southern Manitoba.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:On the Great Plains, Kansas, 294 miles west of Missouri River. (redo 2016).jpg|thumb|The Great Plains near a farming community in central Kansas]]\n\nThe term \"Great Plains\" is used in the United States to describe a sub-section of the even more vast [[Interior Plains]] physiographic division, which covers much of the interior of North America. It also has currency as a region of human geography, referring to the [[Plains Indians]] or the [[Plains states]].\n\nIn Canada the term is rarely used; [[Natural Resources Canada]], the government department responsible for official mapping, treats the Interior Plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains. There is no region referred to as the \"Great Plains\" in ''[[Atlas of Canada|The Atlas of Canada]]''.<ref>[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/arm_physio_plains/1 Atlas.nrcan.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122000541/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/arm_physio_plains/1 |date=2013-01-22 }}</ref> In terms of human geography, the term ''prairie'' is more commonly used in Canada, and the region is known as the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie Provinces]] or simply \"the Prairies\".\n\nThe ''[[North American Environmental Atlas]]'', produced by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]], a NAFTA agency composed of the geographical agencies of the Mexican, American, and Canadian governments, uses the \"Great Plains\" as an [[ecoregion]] synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120724143053/http://www.cec.org/atlas/ CEC.org]</ref>  The Great Plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions: Temperate Prairies, West-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, South-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, Texas Louisiana Coastal Plains, and Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain, which overlap or expand upon other Great Plains designations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm|title=About the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Extent==\n[[File:Johnson 1920 HighPlains.jpg|thumb|The Great Plains before the native grasses were ploughed under, [[Haskell County, Kansas]], 1897, showing a man sitting behind a [[buffalo wallow]]]]\n\nThe region is about {{convert|500|mi|abbr=on}} east to west and {{convert|2000|mi|abbr=on}} north to south.

The [[United States Geological Survey]] divides the Great Plains in the United States into ten physiographic subdivisions:\n* [[Coteau du Missouri]] or Missouri Plateau (which also extends into [[Canada]]), glaciated \u2013 east central South Dakota, northern and eastern North Dakota and northeastern Montana;\n* Coteau du Missouri, unglaciated \u2013 western South Dakota, northeastern [[Wyoming]], southwestern North Dakota and southeastern Montana;\n* [[Black Hills]] \u2013 western South Dakota;\n* [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] \u2013 southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska (including the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sand Hills]]), eastern Colorado, western Kansas, western Oklahoma, [[eastern New Mexico]], and northwestern Texas (including the [[Llano Estacado]] and [[Texas Panhandle]]);\n* Plains Border \u2013 central Kansas and northern Oklahoma (including the [[Flint Hills|Flint]], [[Red Hills (Kansas)|Red]] and [[Smoky Hills]]);\n* [[Colorado Piedmont]] \u2013 eastern Colorado;\n* [[Raton, New Mexico|Raton]] section \u2013 northeastern New Mexico;\n* [[Pecos River|Pecos Valley]] \u2013 eastern New Mexico;\n* [[Edwards Plateau]] \u2013 south central Texas; and\n* [[Central Texas]] section \u2013 central Texas.\n\nThe Great Plains consist of a broad stretch of country underlain by nearly horizontal [[stratum|strata]] extends westward from the [[97th meridian west]] to the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]], a distance of from {{convert|300|to|500|mi}}. It extends northward from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] boundary far into Canada. Although the [[altitude]] of the plains increases gradually from 600 or {{convert|1200|ft|m|abbr=on}} on the east to 4,000\u20135,000 or {{convert|6000|ft|m}} near the mountains, the local relief is generally small. The [[semi-arid climate]] excludes tree growth and opens far-reaching views.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=United States, The/Physical Geography |display=United States, The \u00a7 ''Physical Geography'' |volume=27 |pages=619\u2013620 |inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe plains are by no means a simple unit. They are of diverse structure and of various stages of [[erosion]]al development. They are occasionally interrupted by [[butte]]s and [[escarpment]]s. They are frequently broken by [[valley]]s. Yet on the whole, a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name, Great Plains, for the region as a whole is well-deserved.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe western boundary of the plains is usually well-defined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains. The eastern boundary of the plains is more [[climate|climatic]] than [[topography|topographic]]. The line of 20 in. of annual [[rainfall]] trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian. If a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition, this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies. The plains may be described in northern, intermediate, central and southern sections, in relation to certain peculiar features.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Northern Great Plains ===\nThe northern section of the Great Plains, north of [[44th parallel north|latitude 44\u00b0]], including eastern [[Montana]], north-eastern [[Wyoming]], most of [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], and the Canadian [[Prairie Provinces|Prairies]], is a moderately dissected [[peneplain]]. [[File:Missouri River Valley North Dakota 11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Missouri River Valley in Central North Dakota, near Stanton, ND]]This is one of the best examples of its kind. The strata here are [[Cretaceous]] or early [[Tertiary]], lying nearly horizontal. The surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment, the escarpment-remnant of a resistant stratum. There are also the occasional [[lava]]-capped [[mesa]]s and [[dike (geology)|dike]] formed ridges, surmounting the general level by {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread [[erosion]] of the surrounding plains. All these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central Montana. The peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production. It appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation, for the upper [[Missouri River]] and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain, but in well graded, maturely opened valleys, several hundred feet below the general level. A significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs, however, in the case of the Missouri, the largest river, which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of the mountains. This peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice sheet]]. Here, the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated Canadian highlands far on the north-east, instead of from the much higher mountains near by on the west. The present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas. The [[Black Hills]], chiefly in western [[South Dakota]], are the largest group. They rise like a large island from the sea, occupying an oval area of about {{convert|100|mi}} north-south by {{convert|50|mi}} east-west. At [[Black Elk Peak]], they reach an altitude of {{convert|7216|ft|m}} and have an effective relief over the plains of 2000 or {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} This mountain mass is of flat-arched, dome-like structure, now well dissected by radiating consequent streams. The weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated. The next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] crystalline rocks in about half of the domed area.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Intermediate Great Plains ===\n[[File:Niobrara valley, Nebraska.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Miocene epoch layers under late Pleistocene and Holocene layers(Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska]]In the intermediate section of the plains, between [[44th parallel north|latitudes 44\u00b0]] and [[42nd parallel north|42\u00b0]], including southern [[South Dakota]] and northern [[Nebraska]], the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate. Known as the [[Badlands]], it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet. This is due to several causes:\n* the dry climate, which prevents the growth of a grassy turf\n* the fine texture of the Tertiary strata in the badland districts\n* every little rill, at times of rain, carves its own little valley.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Central Great Plains ===\n[[File:Western Kansas-High Plains Nicodemus.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The High Plains of Kansas, aka Smokey Hills near Nicodemus, Kansas]]The central section of the Great Plains, between [[42nd parallel north|latitudes 42\u00b0]] and [[36th parallel north|36\u00b0]], occupying eastern [[Colorado]] and western [[Kansas]], is, briefly stated, for the most part a dissected [[fluvial|fluviatile]] plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a [[piedmont (disambiguation)|piedmont]] deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section. While the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. Exception to this statement must be made in the southwest, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas ([[Mesa de Maya]], [[Raton Mesa]]) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Southern Great Plains ===\n[[File:Mt-scott.png|thumb|View of Lake Lawtonka, wind turbines, and plains from atop Mount Scott in Oklahoma ]]\nThe southern section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 35.5\u00b0 and 25.5\u00b0, lies in western [[Texas]], eastern [[New Mexico]], and western [[Oklahoma]]. Like the central section, it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. However, the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in such strong relief that it stands up as a table-land, known from the time of Mexican occupation as the [[Llano Estacado]]. It measures roughly {{convert|150|mi}} east-west and {{convert|400|mi}} north-south. It is of very irregular outline, narrowing to the south. Its altitude is {{convert|5500|ft}} at the highest western point, nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied. From there, it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate, first about {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}}, then about 7&nbsp;ft per mile (1.3 m/km), to its eastern and southern borders, where it is {{convert|2000|ft}} in altitude. Like the High Plains farther north, it is extraordinarily smooth.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIt is very dry, except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains. The Llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the [[Canadian River]], and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the [[Pecos River]]. On the east, it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the Red, Brazos and Colorado rivers of Texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately {{convert|500|to|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, overlooking the central denuded area of that state. There, between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by a limestone which underlies both the [[Llano Uplift]] on the west and the [[Grand Prairies]] escarpment on the east. The southern and narrow part of the table-land, called the [[Edwards Plateau]], is more dissected than the rest, and falls off to the south in a frayed-out fault scarp. This scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the [[Rio Grande]] [[embayment]]. The central denuded area, east of the Llano, resembles the east-central section of the plains in exposing older rocks. Between these two similar areas, in the space limited by the Canadian and Red Rivers, rise the subdued forms of the [[Wichita Mountains]] in [[Oklahoma]], the westernmost member of the Ouachita system.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Paleontology==\nDuring the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145\u201366 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. However, during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65\u201355 million years ago), the seaway had begun to recede, leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied.\n\nDuring the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread.  The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s and [[glires]], that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes  in mammals, giving rise to the \"[[Grit, not grass hypothesis|grit, not grass]]\" hypothesis.<ref>Phillip E. Jardine, Christine M. Janis, Sarda Sahney, Michael J. Benton. \"Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires.\" Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology.

Wind speeds are often very high, especially in winter. Grasslands are among the least protected biomes.<ref>{{cite report |title=Threats Assessment for the Northern Great Plains Ecoregion |url=http://www.npcn.net/images/uploads/Threats_Assessment_NGP_Report_Dec2012.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206104731/http://www.npcn.net/images/uploads/Threats_Assessment_NGP_Report_Dec2012.pdf |archive-date=6 December 2013 |date=20 December 2012 |last1=Schrag |first1=A.M. |last2=Olimb |first2=S. |publisher=World Wildlife Fund-U.S |location=Bozeman, MT}}</ref> Humans have converted much of the prairies for agricultural purposes or to create pastures.\n\nThe 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receives {{convert|20|in|abbr=on}} or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than {{convert|20|in|abbr=on}}. In this context, the High Plains, as well as [[Southern Alberta]], south-western Saskatchewan and [[Eastern Montana]] are mainly [[Semi-arid climate|semi arid]] steppe land and are generally characterised by [[ranch|rangeland]] or marginal [[Agriculture|farmland]]. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of [[drought]]; high winds in the region may then generate devastating [[dust storm]]s. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the [[humid continental climate]].\n\nMany [[thunderstorm]]s occur in the plains in the spring through summer. The southeastern portion of the Great Plains is the most [[tornado]] active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as [[Tornado Alley]].\n\n==Flora==\nThe Great Plains are part of the floristic [[North American Prairies Province]], which extends from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Original American contact===\n{{Main|Plains Indians}}\n{{See also|Paleo-Indians}}\n[[File:BuffaloHunters.jpg|thumb|Buffalo hunt under the wolf-skin mask, [[George Catlin]], 1832\u201333.]]\nThe first Americans ([[Paleo-Indians]]) arrived on the Great Plains thousands of years ago.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20287-first-americans-arrived-2500-years-before-we-thought.html |title=First Americans arrived 2500 years before we thought \u2013 life \u2013 24 March 2011 |magazine=New Scientist |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Bill |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/03/24/2947233/texas-artifacts-strongest-evidence.html |title=Texas artifacts 'strongest evidence yet' that humans arrived in North America earlier than thought |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> Historically, the Great Plains were the range of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho]], [[Comanche]], and others.

In that same period, [[Hernando de Soto]] crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now Oklahoma and Texas which is now known as the De Soto Trail. The Spanish thought that the Great Plains were the location of the mythological ''[[Quivira]] and [[Zuni-Cibola Complex|C\u00edbola]]'', a place said to be rich in gold.\n\nThe [[fur trade]] brought thousands of colonial settlers into the Great Plains over the next 100 years. Fur trappers made their way across much of the region, making regular contacts with Indians. The United States acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and conducted the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1804\u20131806, and more information became available concerning the Plains, and various pioneers entered the areas. Fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements. Through the 19th century, more settlers migrated to the Great Plains as part of a vast [[United States territorial acquisitions|westward expansion]] of population, and new settlements became dotted across the Great Plains.\n\nThe settlers also brought diseases against which the Indians had no resistance. Between a half and two-thirds of the Plains Indians are thought to have died of [[smallpox]] by the time of Louisiana Purchase.<ref>\"[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2008&page=24 Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1992)]\".

The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to American farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain farms. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. Towns flourished if they were favored by proximity to the railroad.<ref>Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860\u20131920'' (1985) p. 69</ref>\n\nMuch of the Great Plains became open range where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals, and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Between 1866 and 1895, cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as [[Dodge City, Kansas]]<ref>Robert R. Dykstra, ''Cattle Towns: A Social History of the Kansas Cattle Trading Centers'' (1968)</ref> and [[Ogallala, Nebraska]]; from there, cattle were shipped east.<ref>John Rossel, \"The Chisholm Trail,\" ''Kansas Historical Quarterly'' (1936) Vol. 5, No. 1 pp 3\u201314 [http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1936/36_1_rossel.htm online edition]</ref>\n\nThe U.S. passed the [[Homestead Acts]] of 1862 to encourage agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population. It allowed a settler to claim up to {{convert|160|acre|abbr=off}} of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the [[Kinkaid Act]] of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building houses out of the very turf of the land. Many of them were not skilled farmers, and failures were frequent. The [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.<ref>Ian Frazier, ''Great Plains'' (2001) p. 72</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Homesteader NE 1866.png|[[Homestead Acts|Homesteaders]] in central [[Nebraska]] in 1886\nFile:\"Wheat field on Dutch flats near Mitchell, Nebr.

Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation that they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they understood the need for a hard-working wife and numerous children to handle the many responsibilities.<ref>Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880\u20131940'' (1992).</ref> During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology encouraged women to turn to domestic roles, including sewing and washing machines. Media and government extension agents promoted the \"scientific housekeeping\" movement, along with county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm book keeping, and home economics courses in the schools.<ref>Chad Montrie, \"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp. 245\u2013258. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/greatplainsquarterly/159 Online]</ref>\n\nThe eastern image of farm life in the prairies emphasized the isolation of the lonely farmer and wife, yet plains residents created busy social lives for themselves. They often sponsored activities which combined work, food, and entertainment, such as [[barn raising]]s, corn huskings, quilting bees,<ref>Karl Ronning, \"Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880\u20131920\", ''Uncoverings'', 1992, Vol. 13, pp. 169\u2013191.</ref> [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] meetings, church activities and school functions.

The effects of an extended drought, inappropriate cultivation, and financial crises of the [[Great Depression]] forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains.\n\nFrom the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large land-holdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata. [[Center pivot irrigation]] is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.<ref>Bobby A. Stewart and Terry A. Howell, ''Encyclopedia of water science'' (2003) p. 43</ref>\n\n====Population decline====\n{{main|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than {{convert|6|PD/sqmi|PD/sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the density standard that [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] used to declare the American frontier \"closed\" in 1893. Many have fewer than {{convert|2|PD/sqmi|PD/sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}}. There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian [[Daniel Fitzgerald (writer)|Daniel Fitzgerald]]. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable,<ref>Amanda Rees, ''The Great Plains region'' (2004) p. xvi</ref> and there has been a proposal to return approximately {{convert|139000|sqmi|abbr=on}} of these drier parts to native prairie land.\n\n==Wind power==\n[[File:GreenMountainWindFarm Fluvanna 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Wind farm]] in the plains of [[West Texas]]]]\n\nThe Great Plains contributes substantially to [[wind power in the United States]].

It lies west of the [[Mississippi River]] tallgrass prairie in the United States and east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the U.S. and Canada. It encompasses:\n\n* The entirety of [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]\n\n* Parts of [[Colorado]], [[Montana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Kansas]]\n\n* The southern portions of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]] \n\nThe region is known for supporting extensive cattle ranching and dry farming. The Canadian portion of the Plains is known as the [[Canadian Prairies]]. It covers much of Alberta and southern Saskatchewan, and a narrow band of southern Manitoba.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:On the Great Plains, Kansas, 294 miles west of Missouri River. (redo 2016).jpg|thumb|The Great Plains near a farming community in central Kansas]]\n\nThe term \"Great Plains\" is used in the United States to describe a sub-section of the even more vast [[Interior Plains]] physiographic division, which covers much of the interior of North America. It also has currency as a region of human geography, referring to the [[Plains Indians]] or the [[Plains states]].\n\nIn Canada the term is rarely used; [[Natural Resources Canada]], the government department responsible for official mapping, treats the Interior Plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaux and plains. There is no region referred to as the \"Great Plains\" in ''[[Atlas of Canada|The Atlas of Canada]]''.<ref>[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/arm_physio_plains/1 Atlas.nrcan.gc.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122000541/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/environment/land/arm_physio_plains/1 |date=2013-01-22 }}</ref> In terms of human geography, the term ''prairie'' is more commonly used in Canada, and the region is known as the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie Provinces]] or simply \"the Prairies\".\n\nThe ''[[North American Environmental Atlas]]'', produced by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]], a NAFTA agency composed of the geographical agencies of the Mexican, American, and Canadian governments, uses the \"Great Plains\" as an [[ecoregion]] synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120724143053/http://www.cec.org/atlas/ CEC.org]</ref>  The Great Plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions: Temperate Prairies, West-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, South-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, Texas Louisiana Coastal Plains, and Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain, which overlap or expand upon other Great Plains designations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/ecoregions/na_eco.htm|title=About the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Extent==\n[[File:Johnson 1920 HighPlains.jpg|thumb|The Great Plains before the native grasses were ploughed under, [[Haskell County, Kansas]], 1897, showing a man sitting behind a [[buffalo wallow]]]]\n\nThe region is about {{convert|500|mi|abbr=on}} east to west and {{convert|2000|mi|abbr=on}} north to south.

The [[United States Geological Survey]] divides the Great Plains in the United States into ten physiographic subdivisions:\n* [[Coteau du Missouri]] or Missouri Plateau (which also extends into [[Canada]]), glaciated \u2013 east central South Dakota, northern and eastern North Dakota and northeastern Montana;\n* Coteau du Missouri, unglaciated \u2013 western South Dakota, northeastern [[Wyoming]], southwestern North Dakota and southeastern Montana;\n* [[Black Hills]] \u2013 western South Dakota;\n* [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] \u2013 southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska (including the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sand Hills]]), eastern Colorado, western Kansas, western Oklahoma, [[eastern New Mexico]], and northwestern Texas (including the [[Llano Estacado]] and [[Texas Panhandle]]);\n* Plains Border \u2013 central Kansas and northern Oklahoma (including the [[Flint Hills|Flint]], [[Red Hills (Kansas)|Red]] and [[Smoky Hills]]);\n* [[Colorado Piedmont]] \u2013 eastern Colorado;\n* [[Raton, New Mexico|Raton]] section \u2013 northeastern New Mexico;\n* [[Pecos River|Pecos Valley]] \u2013 eastern New Mexico;\n* [[Edwards Plateau]] \u2013 south central Texas; and\n* [[Central Texas]] section \u2013 central Texas.\n\nThe Great Plains consist of a broad stretch of country underlain by nearly horizontal [[stratum|strata]] extends westward from the [[97th meridian west]] to the base of the [[Rocky Mountains]], a distance of from {{convert|300|to|500|mi}}. It extends northward from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] boundary far into Canada. Although the [[altitude]] of the plains increases gradually from 600 or {{convert|1200|ft|m|abbr=on}} on the east to 4,000\u20135,000 or {{convert|6000|ft|m}} near the mountains, the local relief is generally small. The [[semi-arid climate]] excludes tree growth and opens far-reaching views.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=United States, The/Physical Geography |display=United States, The \u00a7 ''Physical Geography'' |volume=27 |pages=619\u2013620 |inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe plains are by no means a simple unit. They are of diverse structure and of various stages of [[erosion]]al development. They are occasionally interrupted by [[butte]]s and [[escarpment]]s. They are frequently broken by [[valley]]s. Yet on the whole, a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name, Great Plains, for the region as a whole is well-deserved.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe western boundary of the plains is usually well-defined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains. The eastern boundary of the plains is more [[climate|climatic]] than [[topography|topographic]]. The line of 20 in. of annual [[rainfall]] trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian. If a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition, this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies. The plains may be described in northern, intermediate, central and southern sections, in relation to certain peculiar features.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Northern Great Plains ===\nThe northern section of the Great Plains, north of [[44th parallel north|latitude 44\u00b0]], including eastern [[Montana]], north-eastern [[Wyoming]], most of [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], and the Canadian [[Prairie Provinces|Prairies]], is a moderately dissected [[peneplain]]. [[File:Missouri River Valley North Dakota 11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Missouri River Valley in Central North Dakota, near Stanton, ND]]This is one of the best examples of its kind. The strata here are [[Cretaceous]] or early [[Tertiary]], lying nearly horizontal. The surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment, the escarpment-remnant of a resistant stratum. There are also the occasional [[lava]]-capped [[mesa]]s and [[dike (geology)|dike]] formed ridges, surmounting the general level by {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread [[erosion]] of the surrounding plains. All these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central Montana. The peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production. It appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation, for the upper [[Missouri River]] and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain, but in well graded, maturely opened valleys, several hundred feet below the general level. A significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs, however, in the case of the Missouri, the largest river, which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about {{convert|50|mi|km}} east of the mountains. This peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice sheet]]. Here, the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated Canadian highlands far on the north-east, instead of from the much higher mountains near by on the west. The present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas. The [[Black Hills]], chiefly in western [[South Dakota]], are the largest group. They rise like a large island from the sea, occupying an oval area of about {{convert|100|mi}} north-south by {{convert|50|mi}} east-west. At [[Black Elk Peak]], they reach an altitude of {{convert|7216|ft|m}} and have an effective relief over the plains of 2000 or {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} This mountain mass is of flat-arched, dome-like structure, now well dissected by radiating consequent streams. The weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated. The next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] crystalline rocks in about half of the domed area.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Intermediate Great Plains ===\n[[File:Niobrara valley, Nebraska.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Miocene epoch layers under late Pleistocene and Holocene layers(Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska]]In the intermediate section of the plains, between [[44th parallel north|latitudes 44\u00b0]] and [[42nd parallel north|42\u00b0]], including southern [[South Dakota]] and northern [[Nebraska]], the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate. Known as the [[Badlands]], it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet. This is due to several causes:\n* the dry climate, which prevents the growth of a grassy turf\n* the fine texture of the Tertiary strata in the badland districts\n* every little rill, at times of rain, carves its own little valley.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Central Great Plains ===\n[[File:Western Kansas-High Plains Nicodemus.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The High Plains of Kansas, aka Smokey Hills near Nicodemus, Kansas]]The central section of the Great Plains, between [[42nd parallel north|latitudes 42\u00b0]] and [[36th parallel north|36\u00b0]], occupying eastern [[Colorado]] and western [[Kansas]], is, briefly stated, for the most part a dissected [[fluvial|fluviatile]] plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a [[piedmont (disambiguation)|piedmont]] deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section. While the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. Exception to this statement must be made in the southwest, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas ([[Mesa de Maya]], [[Raton Mesa]]) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Southern Great Plains ===\n[[File:Mt-scott.png|thumb|View of Lake Lawtonka, wind turbines, and plains from atop Mount Scott in Oklahoma ]]\nThe southern section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 35.5\u00b0 and 25.5\u00b0, lies in western [[Texas]], eastern [[New Mexico]], and western [[Oklahoma]]. Like the central section, it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. However, the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in such strong relief that it stands up as a table-land, known from the time of Mexican occupation as the [[Llano Estacado]]. It measures roughly {{convert|150|mi}} east-west and {{convert|400|mi}} north-south. It is of very irregular outline, narrowing to the south. Its altitude is {{convert|5500|ft}} at the highest western point, nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied. From there, it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate, first about {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}}, then about 7&nbsp;ft per mile (1.3 m/km), to its eastern and southern borders, where it is {{convert|2000|ft}} in altitude. Like the High Plains farther north, it is extraordinarily smooth.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIt is very dry, except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains. The Llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the [[Canadian River]], and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the [[Pecos River]]. On the east, it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the Red, Brazos and Colorado rivers of Texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately {{convert|500|to|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, overlooking the central denuded area of that state. There, between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by a limestone which underlies both the [[Llano Uplift]] on the west and the [[Grand Prairies]] escarpment on the east. The southern and narrow part of the table-land, called the [[Edwards Plateau]], is more dissected than the rest, and falls off to the south in a frayed-out fault scarp. This scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the [[Rio Grande]] [[embayment]]. The central denuded area, east of the Llano, resembles the east-central section of the plains in exposing older rocks. Between these two similar areas, in the space limited by the Canadian and Red Rivers, rise the subdued forms of the [[Wichita Mountains]] in [[Oklahoma]], the westernmost member of the Ouachita system.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Paleontology==\nDuring the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145\u201366 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. However, during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65\u201355 million years ago), the seaway had begun to recede, leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain which the seaway had once occupied.\n\nDuring the Cenozoic era, specifically about 25 million years ago during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs, the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread.  The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s and [[glires]], that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Traditionally, the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked. However, an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes  in mammals, giving rise to the \"[[Grit, not grass hypothesis|grit, not grass]]\" hypothesis.<ref>Phillip E. Jardine, Christine M. Janis, Sarda Sahney, Michael J.

In this context, the High Plains, as well as [[Southern Alberta]], south-western Saskatchewan and [[Eastern Montana]] are mainly [[Semi-arid climate|semi arid]] steppe land and are generally characterised by [[ranch|rangeland]] or marginal [[Agriculture|farmland]]. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of [[drought]]; high winds in the region may then generate devastating [[dust storm]]s. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the [[humid continental climate]].\n\nMany [[thunderstorm]]s occur in the plains in the spring through summer. The southeastern portion of the Great Plains is the most [[tornado]] active area in the world and is sometimes referred to as [[Tornado Alley]].\n\n==Flora==\nThe Great Plains are part of the floristic [[North American Prairies Province]], which extends from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Original American contact===\n{{Main|Plains Indians}}\n{{See also|Paleo-Indians}}\n[[File:BuffaloHunters.jpg|thumb|Buffalo hunt under the wolf-skin mask, [[George Catlin]], 1832\u201333.]]\nThe first Americans ([[Paleo-Indians]]) arrived on the Great Plains thousands of years ago.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20287-first-americans-arrived-2500-years-before-we-thought.html |title=First Americans arrived 2500 years before we thought \u2013 life \u2013 24 March 2011 |magazine=New Scientist |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Bill |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/03/24/2947233/texas-artifacts-strongest-evidence.html |title=Texas artifacts 'strongest evidence yet' that humans arrived in North America earlier than thought |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> Historically, the Great Plains were the range of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho]], [[Comanche]], and others.

In that same period, [[Hernando de Soto]] crossed a west-northwest direction in what is now Oklahoma and Texas which is now known as the De Soto Trail. The Spanish thought that the Great Plains were the location of the mythological ''[[Quivira]] and [[Zuni-Cibola Complex|C\u00edbola]]'', a place said to be rich in gold.\n\nThe [[fur trade]] brought thousands of colonial settlers into the Great Plains over the next 100 years. Fur trappers made their way across much of the region, making regular contacts with Indians. The United States acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and conducted the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1804\u20131806, and more information became available concerning the Plains, and various pioneers entered the areas. Fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements. Through the 19th century, more settlers migrated to the Great Plains as part of a vast [[United States territorial acquisitions|westward expansion]] of population, and new settlements became dotted across the Great Plains.\n\nThe settlers also brought diseases against which the Indians had no resistance. Between a half and two-thirds of the Plains Indians are thought to have died of [[smallpox]] by the time of Louisiana Purchase.<ref>\"[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2008&page=24 Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States (1992)]\".

The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to American farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain farms. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. Towns flourished if they were favored by proximity to the railroad.<ref>Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860\u20131920'' (1985) p. 69</ref>\n\nMuch of the Great Plains became open range where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals, and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Between 1866 and 1895, cowboys herded 10 million cattle north to rail heads such as [[Dodge City, Kansas]]<ref>Robert R. Dykstra, ''Cattle Towns: A Social History of the Kansas Cattle Trading Centers'' (1968)</ref> and [[Ogallala, Nebraska]]; from there, cattle were shipped east.<ref>John Rossel, \"The Chisholm Trail,\" ''Kansas Historical Quarterly'' (1936) Vol. 5, No. 1 pp 3\u201314 [http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1936/36_1_rossel.htm online edition]</ref>\n\nThe U.S. passed the [[Homestead Acts]] of 1862 to encourage agricultural development of the Great Plains and house a growing population. It allowed a settler to claim up to {{convert|160|acre|abbr=off}} of land, provided that he lived on it for a period of five years and cultivated it. The provisions were expanded under the [[Kinkaid Act]] of 1904 to include a homestead of an entire section. Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building houses out of the very turf of the land. Many of them were not skilled farmers, and failures were frequent. The [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871 served a similar function for establishing homesteads on the prairies in Canada.<ref>Ian Frazier, ''Great Plains'' (2001) p. 72</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Homesteader NE 1866.png|[[Homestead Acts|Homesteaders]] in central [[Nebraska]] in 1886\nFile:\"Wheat field on Dutch flats near Mitchell, Nebr.

Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in expectation that they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they understood the need for a hard-working wife and numerous children to handle the many responsibilities.<ref>Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880\u20131940'' (1992).</ref> During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology encouraged women to turn to domestic roles, including sewing and washing machines. Media and government extension agents promoted the \"scientific housekeeping\" movement, along with county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm book keeping, and home economics courses in the schools.<ref>Chad Montrie, \"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp. 245\u2013258.

They often sponsored activities which combined work, food, and entertainment, such as [[barn raising]]s, corn huskings, quilting bees,<ref>Karl Ronning, \"Quilting in Webster County, Nebraska, 1880\u20131920\", ''Uncoverings'', 1992, Vol. 13, pp. 169\u2013191.</ref> [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] meetings, church activities and school functions.

The effects of an extended drought, inappropriate cultivation, and financial crises of the [[Great Depression]] forced many farmers off the land throughout the Great Plains.\n\nFrom the 1950s on, many areas of the Great Plains have become productive crop-growing areas because of extensive irrigation on large land-holdings. The United States is a major exporter of agricultural products. The southern portion of the Great Plains lies over the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], a huge underground layer of water-bearing strata. [[Center pivot irrigation]] is used extensively in drier sections of the Great Plains, resulting in aquifer depletion at a rate that is greater than the ground's ability to recharge.<ref>Bobby A. Stewart and Terry A. Howell, ''Encyclopedia of water science'' (2003) p. 43</ref>\n\n====Population decline====\n{{main|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe rural Plains have lost a third of their population since 1920. Several hundred thousand square miles of the Great Plains have fewer than {{convert|6|PD/sqmi|PD/sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the density standard that [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] used to declare the American frontier \"closed\" in 1893. Many have fewer than {{convert|2|PD/sqmi|PD/sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}}. There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian [[Daniel Fitzgerald (writer)|Daniel Fitzgerald]]. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable,<ref>Amanda Rees, ''The Great Plains region'' (2004) p. xvi</ref> and there has been a proposal to return approximately {{convert|139000|sqmi|abbr=on}} of these drier parts to native prairie land.\n\n==Wind power==\n[[File:GreenMountainWindFarm Fluvanna 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Wind farm]] in the plains of [[West Texas]]]]\n\nThe Great Plains contributes substantially to [[wind power in the United States]].

The next day, the ''Times'' added Duranty's own denial.\n\nBritish journalist [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] (who went hopefully to live in the ''New Civilization'' in 1932, but soon became disillusioned) said of Duranty that he \"always enjoyed his company; there was something vigorous, vivacious, preposterous, about his unscrupulousness which made his persistent lying somehow absorbing.\"<ref>Muggeridge, Malcolm: ''The Green Stick: Chronicles of Wasted Time'' Volume I Chapter 5 (1972).</ref> Muggeridge characterised Duranty as \"the greatest liar of any journalist I have met in 50 years of journalism.\"<ref>[[Robert Conquest]].
