In 1889, the Air Brake plant was moved to [[Wilmerding, Pennsylvania]], a small farming town located 14 miles outside of Pittsburgh.<ref name=\"Wilmerding News\">Life in Wilmerding, \u201cThe Air Brake City\u201d the Ideal Hometown. ''Wilmerding News'', 2 September.4.</ref> At the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. [[Socialism]] was strong in Wilmerding, and it was thought to be \u201cThe Ideal Town\u201d for the company because of its location immediately adjacent to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and its mainly blue-collar inhabitants.  In the 1890s, the Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but the bulk of its workforce consisted of the firm's employees lived in the vicinity of Wilmerding.<ref name=\"Wilmerding News\" />\n  \nWilmerding developed rapidly around this new and growing company, and the town soon became known for this industry. A little under one third of its population was somehow related, and more often than not one would end up raising their children in the same home that they were raised in.  Local business prospered as well.<ref>Richard Shumaker, \"A View from Our Porch.\" George Westinghouse Museum. 1-3.</ref> Many of the passengers that were departing from or coming into Wilmerding stopped to shop at these stores along the narrow sidewalk before heading home.\n \nWorking conditions at the Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WA&B) were more than adequate, and the company instituted new policies for its employees. For example, in 1869, it was one of the first companies to institute a 9-hour work day and a 55-hour work week, at a time when typical working days spanned between 10 and 12 hours (and sometimes more), and where a 60-hour work week was only considered moderate.<ref name=\"Wilmerding News\" /> WA&B also got the reputation for being the first industry in America to adopt half holidays on Saturday afternoons. Various benefit options were also instituted in order to improve the working and living conditions of the firm's employees.\n \nThe Air Brake plant prospered, and the surrounding community thrived alongside it. By 1905, over two million freight, passenger, mail, baggage, and express cars and 89,000 locomotives were equipped with Westinghouse Air Brakes. However, business was seasonally variable, and there were dips as well. Wilmerding men complained that, during the non-busy season, half routinely found themselves unemployed.  This was not surprising, given that Wilmerding was a one-industry town, and thus unprofitable periods translated directly into a lower standard of living in the area. \n  \nIn the early 1900s, the Westinghouse Company built houses on a tract of land that it had purchased. In turn, it then sold those homes to its workers at an economical price. The company also offered educational and cultural activities, usually run through the local Y.M.C.A, to obtain better workers. Additionally, WA&B catered to its workers who lost their ability to work, by providing an early form of a disability insurance plan. To insure a certain income to employees who might have been unfit for work because of illness or injury, an ordered sum would be paid to the beneficiary. Any employee under 50 was eligible for membership after a physical examination. The members contributed according to the class which they belonged to, with their class being determined by the amount of money they made per month. Their contribution ranged from fifty cents to $1.50, which in turn (in case of disability) would pay out benefits for thirty-nine consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web| title= Inside an American Factory: Westinghouse Works, 1904.| url= http://memory.loc.gov/collections/wes/history.html| date= 2006-09-26}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> According to Wilmerding News during this time, about 76% of WA&B's employees held a plan membership with the company.\n  \nThe Westinghouse Air Brake company continued producing products in Wilmerding, with various managers over the years.

One problem with this first form of the air brake was that braking was applied to the first cars in a train much sooner than to the rear cars, resulting in shocks and damages when the rear cars bunted against the cars ahead of them.\n\nThe main objection, however, was that it was not an '''automatic''' brake, i.e. even a minor mishap like a broken [[Railway coupling|coupling]] left the entire train without any brake power at all.\n\n===The plain automatic air brake===\nIn 1872, George Westinghouse invented the automatic air brake by inventing the [[Railway air brake#Overview|triple valve]] and by equipping each car with its own air cylinder.  Air pressure is maintained in the auxiliary reservoirs and in the train pipe at all times when the brakes are not applied.  An equilibrium of air pressure is maintained in the train pipe and in the auxiliary air cylinders.\n\nTo apply the brakes to all of the cars at about the same time, pressure is released from the train pipe, causing the triple valve on each car to apply the brakes.  To release the brakes on each car, pressure is increased in the train pipe until an excess pressure above that of the pressure in each auxiliary cylinder is reached, which throws the triple valve so as to close the inlet to the brake cylinder and open the inlet to the auxiliary reservoir from the train pipe, thus allowing the  equilibrium of the two pressures to be reached.\n\n===The quick action triple valve===\nAlthough the plain automatic air brake was a great improvement over the straight air brake, in an emergency the system still applied the brakes to the last cars in a train later than to the first cars in a train.  To remedy that condition, George Westinghouse invented the quick action triple valve in 1887.  This triple valve system was tested by George Westinghouse on the [[CB&Q]] West Burlington hill (Iowa) during 1887.  It automatically vents air from the brake pipe locally on each car, which applies the brakes more quickly.\n\n===Electric railways===\nFor the air brake to be employed on electric railways, an [[air compressor]] that is powered by electricity is required. Powerful [[electric locomotive]]s were produced by the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company]] and by other companies.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Haulpak]] - Manufacturer of high capacity [[haul truck]]s, now part of [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]]\n*[[WABCO Vehicle Control Systems]] \u2013 a successor of Westinghouse Air Brake Company \n*[[Wabtec]] - also a successor of Westinghouse Air Brake Company \n*[[Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd]] \u2013 Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK\n*[[Knorr-Bremse]] \u2013 successor of the Chippenham air brake business\n*[[Union Switch & Signal]] - WABCO subsidiary\n*[[Melpar]] - Government contract subsidiary from 1951 until the 1970s\n*[[R.G.

In 1889, the Air Brake plant was moved to [[Wilmerding, Pennsylvania]], a small farming town located 14 miles outside of Pittsburgh.<ref name=\"Wilmerding News\">Life in Wilmerding, \u201cThe Air Brake City\u201d the Ideal Hometown. ''Wilmerding News'', 2 September.4.</ref> At the time, was only inhabited by about 5,000 people. [[Socialism]] was strong in Wilmerding, and it was thought to be \u201cThe Ideal Town\u201d for the company because of its location immediately adjacent to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and its mainly blue-collar inhabitants.  In the 1890s, the Air Brake Company employed 3,000 citizens from the surrounding Pittsburgh area, but the bulk of its workforce consisted of the firm's employees lived in the vicinity of Wilmerding.<ref name=\"Wilmerding News\" />\n  \nWilmerding developed rapidly around this new and growing company, and the town soon became known for this industry. A little under one third of its population was somehow related, and more often than not one would end up raising their children in the same home that they were raised in.  Local business prospered as well.<ref>Richard Shumaker, \"A View from Our Porch.\" George Westinghouse Museum. 1-3.</ref> Many of the passengers that were departing from or coming into Wilmerding stopped to shop at these stores along the narrow sidewalk before heading home.\n \nWorking conditions at the Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WA&B) were more than adequate, and the company instituted new policies for its employees. For example, in 1869, it was one of the first companies to institute a 9-hour work day and a 55-hour work week, at a time when typical working days spanned between 10 and 12 hours (and sometimes more), and where a 60-hour work week was only considered moderate.<ref name=\"Wilmerding News\" /> WA&B also got the reputation for being the first industry in America to adopt half holidays on Saturday afternoons. Various benefit options were also instituted in order to improve the working and living conditions of the firm\u2019s employees.\n \nThe Air Brake plant prospered, and the surrounding community thrived alongside it. By 1905, over two million freight, passenger, mail, baggage, and express cars and 89,000 locomotives were equipped with Westinghouse Air Brakes. However, business was seasonally variable, and there were dips as well. Wilmerding men complained that, during the non-busy season, half routinely found themselves unemployed.  This was not surprising, given that Wilmerding was a one-industry town, and thus unprofitable periods translated directly into a lower standard of living in the area. \n  \nIn the early 1900s, the Westinghouse Company built houses on a tract of land that it had purchased. In turn, it then sold those homes to its workers at an economical price. The company also offered educational and cultural activities, usually run through the local Y.M.C.A, to obtain better workers. Additionally, WA&B catered to its workers who lost their ability to work, by providing an early form of a disability insurance plan. To insure a certain income to employees who might have been unfit for work because of illness or injury, an ordered sum would be paid to the beneficiary. Any employee under 50 was eligible for membership after a physical examination. The members contributed according to the class which they belonged to, with their class being determined by the amount of money they made per month. Their contribution ranged from fifty cents to $1.50, which in turn (in case of disability) would pay out benefits for thirty-nine consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web| title= Inside an American Factory: Westinghouse Works, 1904.| url= http://memory.loc.gov/collections/wes/history.html| date= 2006-09-26}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> According to Wilmerding News during this time, about 76% of WA&B\u2019s employees held a plan membership with the company.\n  \nThe Westinghouse Air Brake company continued producing products in Wilmerding, with various managers over the years. However, with the shedding of Pittsburgh\u2019s industrial past, the company had become proportionally less important.<ref>Laurent Belsie, \"Westinghouse identity Shift Echoes Pittsburgh\u2019s,\" ''Christian Science Monitor'', 15 November 1996, 9.</ref>\n \n===Successors WABCO Holdings and Wabtec===\nThe company has two 21st century successors, which are independent of each other.

One problem with this first form of the air brake was that braking was applied to the first cars in a train much sooner than to the rear cars, resulting in shocks and damages when the rear cars bunted against the cars ahead of them.\n\nThe main objection, however, was that it was not an '''automatic''' brake, i.e. even a minor mishap like a broken [[Railway coupling|coupling]] left the entire train without any brake power at all.\n\n===The plain automatic air brake===\nIn 1872, George Westinghouse invented the automatic air brake by inventing the [[Railway air brake#Overview|triple valve]] and by equipping each car with its own air cylinder.  Air pressure is maintained in the auxiliary reservoirs and in the train pipe at all times when the brakes are not applied.  An equilibrium of air pressure is maintained in the train pipe and in the auxiliary air cylinders.\n\nTo apply the brakes to all of the cars at about the same time, pressure is released from the train pipe, causing the triple valve on each car to apply the brakes.  To release the brakes on each car, pressure is increased in the train pipe until an excess pressure above that of the pressure in each auxiliary cylinder is reached, which throws the triple valve so as to close the inlet to the brake cylinder and open the inlet to the auxiliary reservoir from the train pipe, thus allowing the  equilibrium of the two pressures to be reached.\n\n===The quick action triple valve===\nAlthough the plain automatic air brake was a great improvement over the straight air brake, in an emergency the system still applied the brakes to the last cars in a train later than to the first cars in a train.  To remedy that condition, George Westinghouse invented the quick action triple valve in 1887.  This triple valve system was tested by George Westinghouse on the [[CB&Q]] West Burlington hill (Iowa) during 1887.  It automatically vents air from the brake pipe locally on each car, which applies the brakes more quickly.\n\n===Electric railways===\nFor the air brake to be employed on electric railways, an [[air compressor]] that is powered by electricity is required.

Barrows.  Copyright 1916, Connecticut Valley Historical Society.  Thef. A. Bassett Co. Printers, Springfield, Mass.  Appendix A, \"Meaning of Local Indian Names\".</ref>). Trading houses were built in 1639\u201340 by settlers from the [[Connecticut Colony]]. Massachusetts asserted jurisdiction, and prevailed after a boundary survey. In 1647, Massachusetts made Woronoco part of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]].<ref name=\"dewey1\">[http://www.hampdencountyhistory.com/westfield/wf250/p07.html \"Chronology of Westfield (1)\"], Louis M. Dewey, copyright 1905\u20131919.</ref> Land was incrementally purchased from the Native Americans and granted by the Springfield town meeting to English settlers, beginning in 1658. The area of Woronoco or \"Streamfield\" began to be permanently settled in the 1660s.<ref name=\"dewey1\" /> In 1669, \"Westfield\" was incorporated as an independent town;<ref name=\"dewey2\">[http://www.hampdencountyhistory.com/westfield/wf250/p08.html \"Chronology of Westfield (2)\"], Louis M. Dewey, copyright 1905\u20131919.</ref> in 1920, it would be re-incorporated as a city. The name Westfield would be named for being at the time the most westerly settlement. \"Streamfield\" was considered a name for the town for being settled in between two \"streams\" that flow downtown, the [[Westfield River]] and the Little River.\n\nFrom its founding until 1725, Westfield was the westernmost settlement in the [[Massachusetts Colony]], and portions of it fell within the [[Equivalent Lands]]. Town meetings were held in a church meeting house until 1839, when Town Hall was erected on Broad Street. This building also served as City Hall from 1920 to 1958. Due to its [[Alluvium|alluvial]] lands, the inhabitants of the Westfield area were entirely devoted to agricultural pursuits for about 150 years.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, manufacture of bricks, whips, and cigars became economically important. At one point in the 19th century, Westfield was a prominent center of the [[buggy whip]] industry, and the city is still known as the \"Whip City\". Other firms produced bicycles, paper products, [[Johnson Organs|pipe organs]], boilers and radiators, textile machinery, abrasives, wood products, and precision tools. Westfield transformed itself from an agricultural town into a thriving industrial city in the 19th century, but in the second half of the 20th century its manufacturing base was eroded by wage competition in the [[Southeastern United States|U.S. Southeast]], then overseas.\n\nMeanwhile, with cheap land and convenient access to east\u2013west and north\u2013south interstate highways, the north side developed into a warehousing center to C & S Wholesale, Home Depot, Lowes and other corporations. South of the river, the intersecting trends of growth of [[Westfield State University]] and declining manufacturing changed the city's character.  Students comprise some 15% of Westfield's population, and the old downtown business district caters increasingly to them while mainstream shopping relocates to a commercial strip called East Main Street, part of [[U.S. Route 20]]. A Home Depot store and a Price-Rite were recently added to Westfield's wide array of shopping centers. These stores are located along Route 20.\n\nOnly four buildings exceed four stories in height. Until a major fire on January 6, 1952, the Westfield Professional Building covered half a downtown city block and was six stories tall. The entire building was consumed with extensive damage to neighboring buildings because the fire department's ladder and snorkel vehicles weren't tall enough and the building did not have a sprinkler system. Subsequent zoning prohibited virtually all new construction over three stories, even after improvements in fire suppression technologies and vehicles became available. No building is allowed to be taller than the town's firetruck ladders.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Westfield was at the center of the Pure Food movement, an effort to require stricter standards on the production of food. [[Louis B. Allyn]], a Westfield resident and pure foods expert for ''[[McClure's]] Magazine'', lived in Westfield until his murder. In 1906, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]]. In June 2017, the administration of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced a $300,000 grant to the city for an industrial park expansion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ropek|first=Lucas|title=Baker-Polito administration awards $300,000 for industrial park expansion in Westfield|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|url=https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/baker-polito_administration_aw.html|date=June 23, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Westfield became the first city in Massachusetts, as well as all of New England, to elect a female Mayor when [[Alice Burke]] defeated incumbent Raymond H.

Westfield is split into the \"South Side\" and the \"North Side\" by the [[Westfield River]], and the northwestern section of town is known as Wyben.\n\n[[File:Eastmountain snakepond.jpg|thumb|right|View of Snake Pond and the Westfield countryside from East Mountain]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|122.7|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|120.0|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|2.8|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.24%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nWestfield is situated at the western edge of the downfaulted [[Connecticut River Valley]] where the [[Westfield River]] emerges from the [[Berkshire Hills]] and flows through the center of the city on its way to the [[Connecticut River]] some {{convert|10|mi|0}} downstream. Because of its large, steep and rocky upstream watershed, the river has a history of severe flood episodes, inundating adjacent parts of Westfield several times. In spite of a complicated system of pumps, dikes, waterways, and upstream dams, Westfield lies in a [[floodplain]] zone and is still considered flood-prone.\n\nWestfield is bordered on the east by linear cliffs of volcanic [[trap rock]] known as [[East Mountain (Massachusetts)|East Mountain]] and [[Provin Mountain]]. They are part of the [[Metacomet Ridge]], a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Both mountains are traversed by the {{convert|114|mi|adj=on}} [[Metacomet-Monadnock Trail]], that also crosses the Westfield River with an ill-advised fording or a safer road-walk across the bridge at the junction of Routes 187 and 20. The next road obstacle for hikers in\n\nWestfield is the Massachusetts Turnpike, beneath which hikers can safely walk.\n\nWestfield is on the fringe of the greater [[Northeast megalopolis]]\u2014the most densely populated region of the United States\u2014and has experienced substantial land development for suburban residential and commercial uses for the past six decades. Yet it borders [[Western Massachusetts#The Hilltowns|hilltowns]] to the west that were depopulated of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]] in the 19th century as land became readily available on the [[Homestead Act|western frontier]]. With population dipping below ten per square kilometer in some upland townships, forests are [[reforestation|reverting]] almost to pre-settlement conditions with wild turkey, bears, coyotes and even moose returning after absences perhaps measured in centuries. This transition over a few miles from the 21st century urbanization to population densities nearly as low as early colonial times is notable if not unique.\n\nWestfield is located {{convert|10|mi|0}} west of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], {{convert|39|mi}} southeast of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], {{convert|95|mi}} west of [[Boston]], {{convert|30|mi}} north of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], {{convert|76|mi}} southeast of [[Albany, New York]], and {{convert|145|mi}} northeast of [[New York City]].\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport]], Massachusetts (1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1926\u2013present)\n|collapsed =\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  71\n|Feb record high F =  79\n|Mar record high F =  83\n|Apr record high F =  95\n|May record high F =  98\n|Jun record high F = 102\n|Jul record high F = 103\n|Aug record high F = 101\n|Sep record high F =  97\n|Oct record high F =  87\n|Nov record high F =  76\n|Dec record high F =  73\n\n|Jan high F = 32.9\n|Feb high F = 37.0\n|Mar high F = 45.9\n|Apr high F = 59.1\n|May high F = 70.5\n|Jun high F = 78.0\n|Jul high F = 82.8\n|Aug high F = 81.5\n|Sep high F = 74.0\n|Oct high F = 61.6\n|Nov high F = 49.4\n|Dec high F = 38.2\n|year high F= 59.3\n|Jan low F = 12.9\n|Feb low F = 17.4\n|Mar low F = 25.1\n|Apr low F = 35.4\n|May low F = 45.5\n|Jun low F = 54.7\n|Jul low F = 59.0\n|Aug low F = 58.5\n|Sep low F = 49.8\n|Oct low F = 38.2\n|Nov low F = 30.0\n|Dec low F = 21.0\n|year low F= 37.4\n|Jan record low F = \u221214\n|Feb record low F = \u221220\n|Mar record low F = \u221214\n|Apr record low F =  17\n|May record low F =  25\n|Jun record low F =  34\n|Jul record low F =  40\n|Aug record low F =  41\n|Sep record low F =  28\n|Oct record low F =  18\n|Nov record low F =   5\n|Dec record low F = \u221214\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.26\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.83\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.10\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.37\n|May precipitation inch = 4.44\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.35\n|Jul precipitation inch = 4.09\n|Aug precipitation inch = 4.16\n|Sep precipitation inch = 4.49\n|Oct precipitation inch = 4.75\n|Nov precipitation inch = 4.12\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.43\n|year precipitation inch=48.39\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name=\"NOWData BOX\">{{cite web|url = http://www.nws.NOAA.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=box |title = NowData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |accessdate = 2018-05-15\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NCDC txt KBAF\">{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00014775.normals.txt |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |title=Station Name: MA WESTFIELD BARNES MUNI AP |accessdate=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|1790|2204\n|1800|2185\n|1810|2130\n|1820|2668\n|1830|2940\n|1840|3526\n|1850|4180\n|1860|5055\n|1870|6519\n|1880|7587\n|1890|9805\n|1900|12310\n|1910|16044\n|1920|18604\n|1930|19775\n|1940|18793\n|1950|20962\n|1960|26302\n|1970|31433\n|1980|36465\n|1990|38372\n|2000|40072\n|2010|41094\n|2018|41680\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote={{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}<ref name=\"1950_Census_Urban_populations_since_1790\">{{cite journal |title=1950 Census of Population|volume=1: Number of Inhabitants|at=Section 6, Pages 21\u20137 through 21-09, Massachusetts Table 4.

Barrows.  Copyright 1916, Connecticut Valley Historical Society.  Thef. A. Bassett Co. Printers, Springfield, Mass.  Appendix A, \"Meaning of Local Indian Names\".</ref>). Trading houses were built in 1639\u201340 by settlers from the [[Connecticut Colony]]. Massachusetts asserted jurisdiction, and prevailed after a boundary survey. In 1647, Massachusetts made Woronoco part of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]].<ref name=\"dewey1\">[http://www.hampdencountyhistory.com/westfield/wf250/p07.html \"Chronology of Westfield (1)\"], Louis M. Dewey, copyright 1905\u20131919.</ref> Land was incrementally purchased from the Native Americans and granted by the Springfield town meeting to English settlers, beginning in 1658. The area of Woronoco or \"Streamfield\" began to be permanently settled in the 1660s.<ref name=\"dewey1\" /> In 1669, \"Westfield\" was incorporated as an independent town;<ref name=\"dewey2\">[http://www.hampdencountyhistory.com/westfield/wf250/p08.html \"Chronology of Westfield (2)\"], Louis M. Dewey, copyright 1905\u20131919.</ref> in 1920, it would be re-incorporated as a city. The name Westfield would be named for being at the time the most westerly settlement. \"Streamfield\" was considered a name for the town for being settled in between two \"streams\" that flow downtown, the [[Westfield River]] and the Little River.\n\nFrom its founding until 1725, Westfield was the westernmost settlement in the [[Massachusetts Colony]], and portions of it fell within the [[Equivalent Lands]]. Town meetings were held in a church meeting house until 1839, when Town Hall was erected on Broad Street. This building also served as City Hall from 1920 to 1958. Due to its [[Alluvium|alluvial]] lands, the inhabitants of the Westfield area were entirely devoted to agricultural pursuits for about 150 years.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, manufacture of bricks, whips, and cigars became economically important. At one point in the 19th century, Westfield was a prominent center of the [[buggy whip]] industry, and the city is still known as the \"Whip City\". Other firms produced bicycles, paper products, [[Johnson Organs|pipe organs]], boilers and radiators, textile machinery, abrasives, wood products, and precision tools. Westfield transformed itself from an agricultural town into a thriving industrial city in the 19th century, but in the second half of the 20th century its manufacturing base was eroded by wage competition in the [[Southeastern United States|U.S. Southeast]], then overseas.\n\nMeanwhile, with cheap land and convenient access to east-west and north-south interstate highways, the north side developed into a warehousing center to C & S Wholesale, Home Depot, Lowes and other corporations. South of the river, the intersecting trends of growth of [[Westfield State University]] and declining manufacturing changed the city's character.  Students comprise some 15% of Westfield's population, and the old downtown business district caters increasingly to them while mainstream shopping relocates to a commercial strip called East Main Street, part of [[U.S. Route 20]]. A Home Depot store and a Price-Rite were recently added to Westfield's wide array of shopping centers. These stores are located along Route 20.\n\nOnly four buildings exceed four stories in height. Until a major fire on January 6, 1952, the Westfield Professional Building covered half a downtown city block and was six stories tall. The entire building was consumed with extensive damage to neighboring buildings because the fire department's ladder and snorkel vehicles weren't tall enough and the building did not have a sprinkler system. Subsequent zoning prohibited virtually all new construction over three stories, even after improvements in fire suppression technologies and vehicles became available. No building is allowed to be taller than the town's firetruck ladders.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Westfield was at the center of the Pure Food movement, an effort to require stricter standards on the production of food. [[Louis B. Allyn]], a Westfield resident and pure foods expert for ''[[McClure's]] Magazine'', lived in Westfield until his murder. In 1906, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906]]. In June 2017, the administration of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced a $300,000 grant to the city for an industrial park expansion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ropek|first=Lucas|title=Baker-Polito administration awards $300,000 for industrial park expansion in Westfield|website=[[The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)|MassLive.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|url=https://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/baker-polito_administration_aw.html|date=June 23, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Westfield became the first city in Massachusetts, as well as all of New England, to elect a female Mayor when [[Alice Burke]] defeated incumbent Raymond H.

Westfield is split into the \"South Side\" and the \"North Side\" by the [[Westfield River]], and the northwestern section of town is known as Wyben.\n\n[[File:Eastmountain snakepond.jpg|thumb|right|View of Snake Pond and the Westfield countryside from East Mountain]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|122.7|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|120.0|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|2.8|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.24%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nWestfield is situated at the western edge of the downfaulted [[Connecticut River Valley]] where the [[Westfield River]] emerges from the [[Berkshire Hills]] and flows through the center of the city on its way to the [[Connecticut River]] some {{convert|10|mi|0}} downstream. Because of its large, steep and rocky upstream watershed, the river has a history of severe flood episodes, inundating adjacent parts of Westfield several times. In spite of a complicated system of pumps, dikes, waterways, and upstream dams, Westfield lies in a [[floodplain]] zone and is still considered flood-prone.\n\nWestfield is bordered on the east by linear cliffs of volcanic [[trap rock]] known as [[East Mountain (Massachusetts)|East Mountain]] and [[Provin Mountain]]. They are part of the [[Metacomet Ridge]], a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Both mountains are traversed by the {{convert|114|mi|adj=on}} [[Metacomet-Monadnock Trail]], that also crosses the Westfield River with an ill-advised fording or a safer road-walk across the bridge at the junction of Routes 187 and 20. The next road obstacle for hikers in\n\nWestfield is the Massachusetts Turnpike, beneath which hikers can safely walk.\n\nWestfield is on the fringe of the greater [[Northeast megalopolis]]\u2014the most densely populated region of the United States\u2014and has experienced substantial land development for suburban residential and commercial uses for the past six decades.
