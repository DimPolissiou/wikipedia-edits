In 1857, the town known as '''County Line''' (the area had previously been known as Hendrick's Blacksmith) changed its name to Telford after the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] Company (later absorbed into the Reading Railroad) named its new station there after civil engineer [[Thomas Telford]].\n===Incorporation as a Borough===\nThe Borough of Telford was incorporated by decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Bucks County of November 10, 1886.<ref>Miscellaneous Docket 2, Pages 67-70, 72-73.

None of the area is covered with water.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Pennsylvania Route 563]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 309|309]] both pass near Telford. Main Street, one of the main roads in the borough, runs along the Bucks-Montgomery County line.\n\nA rail line that was formerly the [[Reading Company]]'s [[Bethlehem Branch]] runs north-south through Telford connecting to [[Perkasie, Pennsylvania|Perkasie]], [[Quakertown, Pennsylvania|Quakertown]], and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]] to the north and [[Souderton, Pennsylvania|Souderton]], [[Hatfield, Pennsylvania|Hatfield]], and [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]] to the south.  The line was used by the [[SEPTA]] [[Bethlehem Line]] until 1981. The tracks are still used for the transport of freight between Lansdale and Quakertown, and beyond. The line is used for occasional scenic rail trips, and resumption of passenger service to Quakertown is being considered. Telford is also the via point location for [[Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad]] out of Lansdale and [[East Penn Railroad]] out of Quakertown. The [[Telford station]] is still standing, though remains vacant.\n\n[[SEPTA Suburban Bus]] [[SEPTA Route 132|Route 132]] starts in Telford and ends at the [[Montgomery Mall (Pennsylvania)|Montgomery Mall]] in [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]], serving Souderton, Hatfield, and Lansdale.<ref name=septa132>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/maps/bus/pdf/132.pdf|title=Route 132 bus map|publisher=SEPTA|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1901 to 1951, an interurban electric trolley line, Lehigh Valley Transit known as the Liberty Bell Limted, ran from Telford north to Allentown (through Quakertown) and south (through Lansdale) to Philadelphia. During World War II, it carried a large number of passengers due to gas rationing forcing a reduction in auto use, but after the war its business declined  and in 1951 it abandoned rail and converted to bus operation.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1890= 125\n|1900= 181\n|1910= 207\n|1920= 313\n|1930= 412\n|1940= 1747\n|1950= 2042\n|1960= 2763\n|1970= 3409\n|1980= 3507\n|1990= 4238\n|2000= 4680\n|2010= 4872\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=4882\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 28, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"USDecennialCensus\">{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=CensusPopEst>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000,  4,681 people, 1,930 households, and 1,200 families resided in the borough.

The line was used by the [[SEPTA]] [[Bethlehem Line]] until 1981. The tracks are still used for the transport of freight between Lansdale and Quakertown, and beyond. The line is used for occasional scenic rail trips, and resumption of passenger service to Quakertown is being considered. Telford is also the via point location for [[Pennsylvania Northeastern Railroad]] out of Lansdale and [[East Penn Railroad]] out of Quakertown. The [[Telford station]] is still standing, though remains vacant.\n\n[[SEPTA Suburban Bus]] [[SEPTA Route 132|Route 132]] starts in Telford and ends at the [[Montgomery Mall (Pennsylvania)|Montgomery Mall]] in [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]], serving Souderton, Hatfield, and Lansdale.<ref name=septa132>{{cite web|url=http://www.septa.org/maps/bus/pdf/132.pdf|title=Route 132 bus map|publisher=SEPTA|accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1901 to 1951, an interurban electric trolley line, Lehigh Valley Transit known as the Liberty Bell Limted, ran from Telford north to Allentown (through Quakertown) and south (through Lansdale) to Philadelphia.

The estrogen definitely  protects women, they have mild symptoms and they don't die from this virus. So, women, you can go shopping to Italy, I've heard that, now, there will be huge discounts there, because now nobody wants to go to Italy. So, prepare your husbands mentally for that.
