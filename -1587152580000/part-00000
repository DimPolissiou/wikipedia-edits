In December 2019 Fyne became the most popular GUI toolkit for Go, by GitHub star count<ref>https://twitter.com/Fyne_io/status/1207621758414704640</ref> and in early February 2020 it was trending as #1 project in GitHub trending ranks.<ref>https://twitter.com/Fyne_io/status/1227238218879291398</ref>\n\n==Development==\nFyne is currently developed by a team of volunteers and is supported by around 40 contributors.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/graphs/contributors | title=Contributors to fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub | date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Members of this group also work on the FyneDesk project to create a new [[Linux]] [[desktop environment]].<ref>https://twitter.com/stephenmhouston/status/1212078602889641984</ref>\n\nThe Fyne toolkit is written primarily in [[Go (programming language)|Go]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://changelog.com/gotime/116 |title = Unusual uses for Go: GUIs (Go Time #116)}}</ref> The team focuses on clean APIs and follows the principles of [[Clean Code]] to sustain maintainability of the project.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md |title = fyne/CONTRIBUTING.md at master \u00b7 fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub |date = 2020-02-25}}</ref> All Fyne projects are continuously tested to check correctness, stability as well as formatting and documentation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://travis-ci.org/fyne-io |title = Fyne.io - Travis CI}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://coveralls.io/github/fyne-io |title = Coveralls.io - Test Coverage History and Statistics}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe code required for a simple \"Hello World\" application is minimal, as follows:\n<source lang=\"go\">\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/app\"\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/widget\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\ta := app.New()\n\n\tw := a.NewWindow(\"Hello\")\n\tw.SetContent(widget.NewVBox(\n\t\twidget.NewLabel(\"Hello Fyne!\"),\n\t\twidget.NewButton(\"Quit\", func() {\n\t\t\ta.Quit()\n\t\t}),\n\t))\n\n\tw.ShowAndRun()\n}\n</source>\n\nTo build this application you will need the Go language and a [[C (programming language)|C]] compiler installed, as well as a graphics driver that supports [[OpenGL]].\nIt an be built and run using the command:\n<code>\n$ go run main.go\n</code>\n\n==Design==\nDesign of the Fyne API and user interface components follows a careful process to ensure the simplicity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://changelog.com/posts/the-careful-process-behind-fynes-simplicity |title = The careful process behind Fyne's simplicity}}</ref> The Fyne toolkit is built in various layers, with each in separate packages. Notable layers include:<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsYrrNiqAs</ref>\n\n===API===\n[[API]], or Application programming interface, is an interface or protocol that allows for communication across different parts of the software. Fyne has a self-documenting API that is also extensible resulting in the ability for each developer to create custom tools unique to their project that will mesh with Fyne itself.\n\n===Vector Graphics===\nThe use of [[vector graphics]] to paint the UI provides a method of adapting to different device and display sizes without losing image fidelity. This allows the programmer to only need to create the UI once and it will look as expected on any device.\n\n===Hierarchy===\n====Canvas====\nCanvas contains all of the contents of a window ranging from the full screen to a group of CanvasObjects.\n\n====CanvasObject====\nCanvasObjects are what actually get rendered on screen such as Text, Rectangle, Line. The objects store size, position and color information for the rendering process.\n\n===Container===\nContainers are groups of CanvasObjects, each container can specify a layout which will contain the sizing and position of its child components. Layouts help the developer arrange components in a manner that response to the container or window size, with several layout types provided including Border, Center, and Grid.\n\n====Widget====\nAll of the components of a window in a CanvasObject are widgets that contain standard user interface elements. Fyne widgets include but are not limited to UI basics such as: Button, Check, Form, Hyperlink, Label, TabContainer, and Toolbar. Basic UI widgets ensure that standard aspects of GUI interactivity act in a predictable and expected way across applications. This helps improve quality of programs while assisting the programmer by removing the need for them to create these tools themself.\n\n===Packages===\nAll components of Fyne are split into packages and then connected via the API to create a final GUI application. In addition to the canvas, layout, and widget packages, notable packages include:\n* App package which is the main entry point for the app which manages understanding the type of device the application is running on and ensures the code will run as expected on that device.\n* Test package enabling [[test-driven development]] to validate the GUI itself functions as expected.\n\n==Use==\nThe largest project currently using the Fyne toolkit is the FyneDesk project, a complete desktop environment for Linux.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/desktop/ |title = A full desktop environment for Linux/Unix using Fyne: Fyne-io/Desktop|date = 2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\nThere are many other applications being built using the toolkit, those that are open source can be found in an application listing<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://apps.fyne.io/ | title=Home}}</ref> website managed by the project.\n\nMany businesses are using the Fyne toolkit to quickly add a graphical user interface to command line tools which they have already built using Go.\n\n==Releases==\n\n* 1.2 -

It is inspired by the principles of Material Design [[Material Design]] to create applications that look and behave consistently across all platforms.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://fyne.io/develop/geometry.html |title = Fyne}}</ref> It is licensed under the terms of the [[BSD licenses|3 Clause BSD License]], supporting the creation of [[Free software|free]] and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] applications. In December 2019 Fyne became the most popular GUI toolkit for Go, by GitHub star count<ref>https://twitter.com/Fyne_io/status/1207621758414704640</ref> and in early February 2020 it was trending as #1 project in GitHub trending ranks.<ref>https://twitter.com/Fyne_io/status/1227238218879291398</ref>\n\n==Development==\nFyne is currently developed by a team of volunteers and is supported by around 40 contributors.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/graphs/contributors | title=Contributors to fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub | date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Members of this group also work on the FyneDesk project to create a new [[Linux]] [[desktop environment]].<ref>https://twitter.com/stephenmhouston/status/1212078602889641984</ref>\n\nThe Fyne toolkit is written primarily in [[Go (programming language)|Go]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://changelog.com/gotime/116 |title = Unusual uses for Go: GUIs (Go Time #116)}}</ref> The team focuses on clean APIs and follows the principles of [[Clean Code]] to sustain maintainability of the project.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md |title = fyne/CONTRIBUTING.md at master \u00b7 fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub |date = 2020-02-25}}</ref> All Fyne projects are continuously tested to check correctness, stability as well as formatting and documentation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://travis-ci.org/fyne-io |title = Fyne.io - Travis CI}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://coveralls.io/github/fyne-io |title = Coveralls.io - Test Coverage History and Statistics}}</ref>\n==Example==\nThe code required for a simple \"Hello World\" application is minimal, as follows:\n<source lang=\"go\">\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/app\"\n\t\"fyne.io/fyne/widget\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\ta := app.New()\n\n\tw := a.NewWindow(\"Hello\")\n\tw.SetContent(widget.NewVBox(\n\t\twidget.NewLabel(\"Hello Fyne!\"),\n\t\twidget.NewButton(\"Quit\", func() {\n\t\t\ta.Quit()\n\t\t}),\n\t))\n\n\tw.ShowAndRun()\n}\n</source>\n\nTo build this application you will need the Go language and a [[C]] compiler installed, as well as a graphics driver that supports [[OpenGL]].\nIt an be built and run using the command:\n<code>\n$ go run main.go\n</code>\n\n==Design==\nDesign of the Fyne API and user interface components follows a careful process to ensure the simplicity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://changelog.com/posts/the-careful-process-behind-fynes-simplicity |title = The careful process behind Fyne's simplicity}}</ref> The Fyne toolkit is built in various layers, with each in separate packages. Notable layers include:<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbsYrrNiqAs</ref>\n\n===API===\n[[API]], or Application programming interface, is an interface or protocol that allows for communication across different parts of the software. Fyne has a self-documenting API that is also extensible resulting in the ability for each developer to create custom tools unique to their project that will mesh with Fyne itself.\n\n===Vector Graphics===\nThe use of [[vector graphics]] to paint the UI provides a method of adapting to different device and display sizes without losing image fidelity. This allows the programmer to only need to create the UI once and it will look as expected on any device.\n\n===Hierarchy===\n====Canvas====\nCanvas contains all of the contents of a window ranging from the full screen to a group of CanvasObjects.\n\n====CanvasObject====\nCanvasObjects are what actually get rendered on screen such as Text, Rectangle, Line. The objects store size, position and color information for the rendering process.\n\n===Container===\nContainers are groups of CanvasObjects, each container can specify a layout which will contain the sizing and position of its child components. Layouts help the developer arrange components in a manner that response to the container or window size, with several layout types provided including Border, Center, and Grid.\n\n====Widget====\nAll of the components of a window in a CanvasObject are widgets that contain standard user interface elements. Fyne widgets include but are not limited to UI basics such as: Button, Check, Form, Hyperlink, Label, TabContainer, and Toolbar. Basic UI widgets ensure that standard aspects of GUI interactivity act in a predictable and expected way across applications. This helps improve quality of programs while assisting the programmer by removing the need for them to create these tools themself.\n\n===Packages===\nAll components of Fyne are split into packages and then connected via the API to create a final GUI application. In addition to the canvas, layout, and widget packages, notable packages include:\n* App package which is the main entry point for the app which manages understanding the type of device the application is running on and ensures the code will run as expected on that device.\n* Test package enabling [[test-driven development]] to validate the GUI itself functions as expected.\n\n==Use==\nThe largest project currently using the Fyne toolkit is the FyneDesk project, a complete desktop environment for Linux.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/desktop/ |title = A full desktop environment for Linux/Unix using Fyne: Fyne-io/Desktop|date = 2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\nThere are many other applications being built using the toolkit, those that are open source can be found in an application listing<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://apps.fyne.io/ | title=Home}}</ref> website managed by the project.\n\nMany businesses are using the Fyne toolkit to quickly add a graphical user interface to command line tools which they have already built using Go.\n\n==Releases==\n\n* 1.2 - Mobile Support<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/releases/tag/v1.2.0 | title=Release 1.2 brings Mobile Support \u00b7 fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub | date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n**Addition of Mobile support (iOS and Android)\n**Addition of support for Raspberry Pi devices (and other OpenGL ES devices)\n**BaseWidget introduced to simplify creation of custom widgets\n\n* 1.1 - Feature Release<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/releases/tag/v1.1.0 | title=Release v1.1 feature release \u00b7 fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub | date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n**MenuBar, PopUpMenu, Select widgets added\n**Gradient primitive added and shadows introduced\n**Added support for text selection\n**Support for disabling widgets\n**Tab / Shift-Tab introduced to rotate focused elements\n\n* 1.0 - First Major Release<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/releases/tag/v1.0.0 | title=Release Fyne's first major release \u00b7 fyne-io/fyne \u00b7 GitHub | date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n**Introduced canvas API for drawing primitives\n**Introduced widget API including Box, Button, Check, Entry, Form, Group, Hyperlink, Icon, Label, ProgressBar, Radio, Scroller, TabContainer and Toolbar\n**Light and dark themes for user interface\n**Support for Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems\n\n==Criticism==\nIssue 299 of Golang Weekly noted the new mobile support from the Fyne project but suggested the design aesthetic was less Material Design and more \"generally Linux-y\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://golangweekly.com/issues/299 |title = Golang Weekly Issue 299: February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n | last      = Williams\n | first     = Andrew\n | title     = Hands-On GUI Application Development in Go\n | date      = 25 February 2019\n | url       = https://www.packtpub.com/gb/application-development/hands-gui-application-development-go\n | edition   = 1st\n | publisher = [[Packt]]\n | isbn      = 978-1-78913-841-2}}\n* {{citation\n | last      = Schilli\n | first     = Mike\n | title     = Linux Magazine 229 - Straight to the Point\n | date      = 1 November 2019\n | publisher = Linux New Media\n | url       = http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2019/229/Straight-to-the-Point}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://fyne.io}}\n* [https://tour.fyne.io Fyne tour]\n* [https://fyne.io/develop/ Developer guides]\n* [https://godoc.org/fyne.io/fyne GoDoc documentation]\n\n[[Category:Application programming interfaces]]\n[[Category:Widget toolkits]]\n", "name_user": "Certes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix links to programming languages, replaced:C\u2192C", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyne_(software)"}

Heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurred, whereas internal energy is a [[state function|property of the state of a system]] and can thus be understood without knowing how the energy got there.\n\nIn a statistical mechanical account of an [[ideal gas]], in which the molecules move independently between instantaneous collisions, the internal energy is the sum total of the gas's independent particles' kinetic energies, and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system's boundary. For a gas that does not have particle interactions except for instantaneous collisions, the term 'thermal energy' is effectively synonymous with '[[internal energy]]'. In many [[statistical physics]] texts, \"thermal energy\" refers to [[kT (energy)|<math>kT</math>]], the product of [[Boltzmann's constant]] and the [[absolute temperature]], also written as <math>k_\\text{B} T</math>.<ref>\n*{{cite book|last=Reichl |first=Linda E.|authorlink= Linda Reichl |title=A Modern Course in Statistical Physics |pages=154 |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |year=2016 |isbn=9783527690466}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kardar |first=Mehran |author-link=Mehran Kardar |title=Statistical Physics of Particles |pages=243 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=9781139464871}}\n*{{cite book|last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |author-link=Richard Feynman |title=Selected Papers of Richard Feynman: With Commentary |url=https://archive.org/details/selectedpapersof0000feyn |url-access=registration |chapter=The Computing Machines in the Future |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |year=2000 |isbn=9789810241315}}\n*{{cite book|last=Feynman |first=Richard P. |title=Statistical Mechanics: A Set of Lectures |pages=265 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=2018 |isbn=9780429972669}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kittel |first=Charles |author-link=Charles Kittel |title=Elementary Statistical Physics |pages=60 |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]] |year=2012 |isbn=9780486138909}}</ref> In a material, especially in condensed matter, such as a liquid or a solid, in which the constituent particles, such as molecules or ions, interact strongly with one another, the energies of such interactions the contribute strongly to the internal energy of the body, but are not simply apparent in the temperature.\n\nThe term 'thermal energy' is also applied to the energy carried by a heat flow,<ref>{{cite book|first1=Neil |last1=Ashcroft |author-link1=Neil Ashcroft |first2=N.

In early 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment was also spun off in its own half-hour series from February 3 to March 3, 1979. The series was later aired in reruns on [[USA Cartoon Express]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe show featured [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Jabberjaw]] and several new characters as competitors in an outer space reworking of ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. Cameo guests included [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]], [[Godzilla (1978 TV series)|Godzilla]] and [[Jana of the Jungle]]; the supporting segments were ''[[Galaxy Goof-Ups]]'', ''The Buford Files'' and ''The Galloping Ghost''. The latter two were repackaged the following year as ''[[Buford and the Galloping Ghost]]''. When ''Galaxy Goof-Ups'' was given its own half-hour timeslot on November 4, 1978, ''Yogi's Space Race'' was reduced to 60 minutes. On February 3, 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment and ''Buford and the Galloping Ghost'' were also spun off in their own half-hour series.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Yogi Bear''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Scare Bear''' (voiced by [[Joe Besser]]): While Yogi remains unchanged save for the change in setting, his friend [[Boo Boo (Yogi Bear)|Boo Boo]] does not appear and was unable to participate in the race. Instead, his companion and partner is Scare Bear, a small fuzzy bear who is afraid of almost everything. Yogi and Scare are a racing team on \"Space Race\" and members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Huckleberry Hound''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Quack-Up''' (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]): Quack-Up is a duck who is the crazy and clumsy pilot of the team while Huck just rests at the top of their ship. They are also members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Jabberjaw and Buford''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Jabberjaw is still on his search for respect from his original series. His partner is Buford, from ''The Buford Files'', where he's the lazy pet dog of two kids, Cindy Mae and Woody who solve mysteries in Fenokee County. Their race ship contains a track on which Buford runs to increase speed, which is seldom used since it is hard to keep him awake. Jabberjaw was once seen running on it during the episode \"The Saturn 500\".\n* '''Nugget Nose''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), '''Wendy''' (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) and '''Rita''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]]): The only racing team in the race that's a trio. They all are characters from ''The Galloping Ghost'' where Wendy and Rita work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch and Nugget Nose is a gold-obsessed [[ghost]] who's jealous about the girls. His nose looks like a nugget (hence the name).\n* '''Captain Good/Phantom Phink and Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge''' (both voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): To the eyes of the other characters, Captain Good is the [[personification]] of good [[sportsmanship]] and fights for everything right. To the viewers, he's actually Phantom Phink, a space racer who uses all possible sorts of cheating like [[Dick Dastardly]], except that he actually wins some races, crossing the finish line either as Captain Good or as Phantom Phink. The duo can transform themselves, and their car, at the touch of a button. Captain Good looks like a handsome white-clad and blond-tressed muscleman while Phink is a skinny costumed creep with a big nose and bristly black beard. Although Good/Phink never tricks people into believing they are seeing both of them at the same time and Phink never shows up for the start of any race, nobody suspects they're one and the same, not even the narrator. Good/Phink usually tries to get help from people who live in the planets where the races take place, no matter which identity he must use. Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is Captain Good's/Phantom Phink's pet cat/dog. Clean Kat is a white and [[snobbish]] cat while Sinister Sludge is a sleazy brown dog who's usually told by Phink to shut up. Whenever Good/Phink morphs, Kat/Sludge morphs together (although he is capable of doing it separated from his master, such as in the Saturn 500, when Phink says dogs aren't allowed on [[Mars]] and he morphs, causing Phink to says cats aren't either and in the Mizar Marathon when Good said that cats aren't allowed in a castle, to which he morphs and Good says that goes for dogs too).\n* '''The Narrator''' (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]): This unseen character is the narrator of the Space Race and presenter of ''the Space Race Biography''. He sometimes talks to the characters of the series.\n* '''El Fabuloso''': The Space Race's official [[computer]] which often speaks in Spanish. It analyzes the races to catch any cheat practiced and often disqualifies Phantom Phink for cheating. Phink usually utilizes his [[alter-ego]] to proceed on the race because of that. In ''Franzia'', after Good/Phink tricks the local version of [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]] to stop the other racers, El Fabuloso finally discovers they're one and the same, but no one believes it and the narrator assumes El Fabuloso has a malfunction. To keep his secret identity, Phink has to convert into Captain Good to save the Space Racers.\n\n==Biography==\nThe series often introduces the biography of some Space Racers or their ancestors. Phantom Phink was once described as a \"descendant\" of [[Dr. Jekyll]], who was described looking like Captain Good while [[Mr. Hyde]] looks like Phink, giving us an idea of Good's/Phink's original look that [[contradiction|contradicts]] the idea believed by many fans that Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is originally a dog since this is his shape as Phantom Phink's pet and Sludge is the one to have a biography.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{No plot|section|date=October 2015}}\nThirteen episodes were broadcast in 1978.

In early 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment was also spun off in its own half-hour series from February 3 to March 3, 1979. The series was later aired in reruns on [[USA Cartoon Express]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe show featured [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Jabberjaw]] and several new characters as competitors in an outer space reworking of ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. Cameo guests included [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]], [[Godzilla (1978 TV series)|Godzilla]] and [[Jana of the Jungle]]; the supporting segments were ''[[Galaxy Goof-Ups]]'', ''The Buford Files'' and ''The Galloping Ghost''. The latter two were repackaged the following year as ''[[Buford and the Galloping Ghost]]''. When ''Galaxy Goof-Ups'' was given its own half-hour timeslot on November 4, 1978, ''Yogi's Space Race'' was reduced to 60 minutes. On February 3, 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment and ''Buford and the Galloping Ghost'' were also spun off in their own half-hour series.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Yogi Bear''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Scare Bear''' (voiced by [[Joe Besser]]): While Yogi remains unchanged save for the change in setting, his friend [[Boo Boo (Yogi Bear)|Boo Boo]] does not appear and was unable to participate in the race. Instead, his companion and partner is Scare Bear, a small fuzzy bear who is afraid of almost everything. Yogi and Scare are a racing team on \"Space Race\" and members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Huckleberry Hound''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Quack-Up''' (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]): Quack-Up is a duck who is the crazy and clumsy pilot of the team while Huck just rests at the top of their ship. They are also members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Jabberjaw and Buford''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Jabberjaw is still on his search for respect from his original series. His partner is Buford, from ''The Buford Files'', where he's the lazy pet dog of two kids, Cindy Mae and Woody who solve mysteries in Fenokee County. Their race ship contains a track on which Buford runs to increase speed, which is seldom used since it is hard to keep him awake. Jabberjaw was once seen running on it during the episode \"The Saturn 500\".\n* '''Nugget Nose''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), '''Wendy''' (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) and '''Rita''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]]): The only racing team in the race that's a trio. They all are characters from ''The Galloping Ghost'' where Wendy and Rita work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch and Nugget Nose is a gold-obsessed [[ghost]] who's jealous about the girls. His nose looks like a nugget (hence the name).\n* '''Captain Good/Phantom Phink and Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge''' (both voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): To the eyes of the other characters, Captain Good is the [[personification]] of good [[sportsmanship]] and fights for everything right. To the viewers, he's actually Phantom Phink, a space racer who uses all possible sorts of cheating like [[Dick Dastardly]], except that he actually wins some races, crossing the finish line either as Captain Good or as Phantom Phink. The duo can transform themselves, and their car, at the touch of a button. Captain Good looks like a handsome white-clad and blond-tressed muscleman while Phink is a skinny costumed creep with a big nose and bristly black beard. Although Good/Phink never tricks people into believing they are seeing both of them at the same time and Phink never shows up for the start of any race, nobody suspects they're one and the same, not even the narrator. Good/Phink usually tries to get help from people who live in the planets where the races take place, no matter which identity he must use. Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is Captain Good's/Phantom Phink's pet cat/dog. Clean Kat is a white and [[snobbish]] cat while Sinister Sludge is a sleazy brown dog who's usually told by Phink to shut up. Whenever Good/Phink morphs, Kat/Sludge morphs together (although he is capable of doing it separated from his master, such as in the Saturn 500, when Phink says dogs aren't allowed on [[Mars]] and he morphs, causing Phink to says cats aren't either and in the Mizar Marathon when Good said that cats aren't allowed in a castle, to which he morphs and Good says that goes for dogs too).\n* '''The Narrator''' (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]): This unseen character is the narrator of the Space Race and presenter of ''the Space Race Biography''. He sometimes talks to the characters of the series.\n* '''El Fabuloso''': The Space Race's official [[computer]] which often speaks in Spanish. It analyzes the races to catch any cheat practiced and often disqualifies Phantom Phink for cheating. Phink usually utilizes his [[alter-ego]] to proceed on the race because of that. In ''Franzia'', after Good/Phink tricks the local version of [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]] to stop the other racers, El Fabuloso finally discovers they're one and the same, but no one believes it and the narrator assumes El Fabuloso has a malfunction. To keep his secret identity, Phink has to convert into Captain Good to save the Space Racers.\n\n==Biography==\nThe series often introduces the biography of some Space Racers or their ancestors. Phantom Phink was once described as a \"descendant\" of [[Dr. Jekyll]], who was described looking like Captain Good while [[Mr. Hyde]] looks like Phink, giving us an idea of Good's/Phink's original look that [[contradiction|contradicts]] the idea believed by many fans that Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is originally a dog since this is his shape as Phantom Phink's pet and Sludge is the one to have a biography.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{No plot|section|date=October 2015}}\nThirteen episodes were broadcast in 1978.

{"title_page": "Uncontrolled decompression", "text_new": "{{short description|An unplanned drop in the pressure of a sealed system }}\n'''Uncontrolled decompression''' is an unplanned drop in the [[pressure]] of a sealed system, such as an [[aircraft cabin]] or [[hyperbaric chamber]], and typically results from [[human reliability|human error]], [[fatigue (material)|material fatigue]], [[engineering]] failure, or [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], causing a [[pressure vessel]] to vent into its lower-pressure surroundings or fail to pressurize at all.\n\nSuch decompression may be classed as ''Explosive, Rapid'', or ''Slow'':\n* '''Explosive decompression''' (ED) is violent, the decompression being too fast for air to safely escape from the [[lung]]s.\n* '''Rapid decompression''', while still fast, is slow enough to allow the lungs to vent.\n* '''Slow''' or '''gradual decompression''' occurs so slowly that it may not be sensed before [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] sets in.\n\n==Description==\nThe term ''uncontrolled decompression'' here refers to the unplanned depressurisation of [[pressure vessel|vessels]] that are occupied by people; for example, a [[cabin pressurization|pressurised aircraft cabin]] at high altitude, a [[spacecraft]], or a [[hyperbaric chamber]]. For the catastrophic failure of other pressure vessels used to contain [[gas]], [[liquid]]s, or [[reactant]]s under pressure, the term [[explosion]] is more commonly used, or other specialised terms such as [[BLEVE]] may apply to particular situations.\n\nDecompression can occur due to structural failure of the pressure vessel, or failure of the compression system itself.<ref name=\"FAA-OPS\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] |url=http://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/airman_education/media/ac%2061-107a.pdf|date=2007-07-15 |title=AC 61-107A \u2013 Operations of aircraft at altitudes above 25,000 feet msl and/or mach numbers (MMO) greater than .75|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref><ref name=Dehart>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals Of Aerospace Medicine: Translating Research Into Clinical Applications, 3rd Rev Ed.|last=Dehart|first=R.

Military pilots with [[oxygen mask]]s have to pressure-breathe, whereby the lungs fill with air when relaxed, and effort has to be exerted to expel the air again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aupress.au.af.mil/digital/pdf/book/brulle_engineering_space_age.pdf|title=Engineering the Space Age: A Rocket Scientist Remembers|author=Robert V.

An example of this is the 2005 [[Helios Airways Flight 522]] crash, in which the pilots failed to check the aircraft was pressurising automatically and then to react to the warnings that the aircraft was depressurising, eventually losing consciousness (along with most of the passengers and crew) from [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].\n\n==Pressure vessel seals and testing==\nSeals in high-pressure vessels are also susceptible to explosive decompression; the [[O-ring]]s or [[rubber]] [[gasket]]s used to seal pressurised pipelines tend to become saturated with high-pressure [[gas]]es. If the pressure inside the vessel is suddenly released, then the gases within the rubber gasket may expand violently, causing blistering or explosion of the material. For this reason, it is common for military and industrial equipment to be subjected to an explosive decompression test before it is certified as safe for use.\n\n==Myths==\n\n===Exposure to a vacuum causes the body to explode===\n{{See also|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}\n\nThis  [[Urban legend|persistent myth]] is based on a failure to distinguish between two types of decompression and their exaggerated portrayal in some [[fiction|fictional works]]. The first type of decompression deals with changing from normal atmospheric pressure (one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]) to a vacuum (zero atmosphere) which is usually centered around [[space exploration]].

In 1974, explosive decompression onboard [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] caused the floor to collapse, severing vital flight control cables in the process. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued an [[Airworthiness Directive]] the following year requiring manufacturers of wide-body aircraft to strengthen floors so that they could withstand the effects of in-flight decompression caused by an opening of up to {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} in the lower deck cargo compartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA Historical Chronology, 1926\u20131996|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}</ref>  Manufacturers were able to comply with the Directive either by strengthening the floors and/or installing relief vents called \"[[Dado (architecture)|dado panels]]\" between the passenger cabin and the cargo compartment.<ref>{{patent|US|6273365}}</ref>\n\nCabin doors are designed to make it nearly impossible to lose pressurization through opening a cabin door in flight, either accidentally or intentionally. The [[plug door]] design ensures that when the pressure inside the cabin exceeds the pressure outside the doors are forced shut and will not open until the pressure is equalised. Cabin doors, including the emergency exits, but not all cargo doors, open inwards, or must first be pulled inwards and then rotated before they can be pushed out through the door frame because at least one dimension of the door is larger than the door frame.  Pressurization prevented the doors of [[Saudia Flight 163]] from being opened on the ground after the aircraft made a successful emergency landing, resulting in the deaths of all 287 passengers and 14 crew members from fire and smoke.\n\nPrior to 1996, approximately 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were [[type certificate|type certified]] to fly up to {{convert|45000|ft}}, without being required to meet special conditions related to flight at high altitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|title=Final Policy FAR Part 25 Sec. 25.841 07/05/1996&#124;Attachment 4}}</ref> In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25\u201387, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin-pressure specifications, for new designs of aircraft types.<ref name=\"FAA_25.841\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/FED94F31539484AB852566720051AA5D?OpenDocument|title=Section 25.841: Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date=1996-05-07|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>  For aircraft [[type certificate|certified]] to operate above 25,000 feet (FL 250; 7,600 m), it \"must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of {{convert|15000|ft}} after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system.\"<ref name=\"FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_25-841.html|title=FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841}}</ref> In the event of a decompression which results from \"any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable,\" the aircraft must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding {{convert|25000|ft}} for more than 2 minutes, nor exceeding an altitude of {{convert|40000|ft}} at any time.<ref name=\"FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841\"/>  In practice, that new FAR amendment imposes an operational [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]] of 40,000 feet on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.<ref name=\"Exemption No. 8695\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgEX.nsf/0/9929ce16709cad0f8625713f00551e74/$FILE/8695.doc|title=Exemption No. 8695|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|location=Renton, Washington|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|title=PS-ANM-03-112-16|accessdate=2009-09-23|author=Steve Happenny}}</ref><ref group=\"Note\">Notable exceptions include the [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787]], and [[Concorde]]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[Airbus]] successfully petitioned the FAA to allow cabin pressure of the [[Airbus A380|A380]] to reach {{convert|43000|ft}} in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed {{convert|40000|ft}} for one minute.

and the crew was able to take some immediate actions after vehicle breakup, although the loads experienced were  much higher as a result of the aerodynamic loads (estimated at 16 G to 21 G).5  The Challenger crew became  incapacitated quickly and could not complete activation of all breathing air systems, leading to the conclusion that an incapacitating cabin depressurization occurred. By comparison, the Columbia crew experienced  lower loads (~3.5 G) at the CE. The fact that none of the crew members lowered their visors strongly  suggests that the crew was incapacitated after the CE by a rapid depressurization.  Although no quantitative conclusion can be made regarding the cabin depressurization rate, it is probable  that the cabin depressurization rate was high enough to incapacitate the crew in a matter of seconds. Conclusion L1-5. The depressurization incapacitated the crew members so rapidly that they were not able to lower their helmet visors.}}</ref>\n| Damage to orbiter [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] at liftoff, leading to disintegration during reentry\n|-\n|[[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]]\n|2004\n|[[Bombardier CRJ100/200|Bombardier CRJ-200]]\n|Accident\n|2/2\n|Gradual decompression\n|Engine flameout\n|-\n|[[Helios Airways Flight 522]]\n| 2005\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Accident\n|{{ntsh|121}}121/121\n| Gradual decompression\n| Pressurization system set to manual for the entire flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/F15FBD7320037284C2257204002B6243/$file/FINAL%20REPORT%205B-DBY.pdf|title=Aircraft Accident Report \u2013 Helios Airways Flight HCY522 Boeing 737-31S at Grammatike, Hellas on 14 August 2005|publisher=Hellenic Republic Ministry Of Transport & Communications: Air Accident Investigation & Aviation Safety Board|date=Nov 2006|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] Flight 536\n| 2005\n| [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/142\n| Rapid decompression\n| Failure of operator to report collision involving a [[Ground support equipment|baggage loading cart]] at the departure gate<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/ |title=Airline Accident: Accident \u2013 Dec. 26, 2005 \u2013 Seattle, Wash. |website=Investigative Reporting Workshop |accessdate=2017-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120223757/http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/# |archive-date=2018-01-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907]]\n| 2006\n| [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|154}}154/154\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air collision\n|-\n| [[Adam Air Flight 574]]\n| 2007\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|102}}102/102\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air breakup\n|-\n| [[Qantas Flight 30]]\n| 2008\n| [[Boeing 747-400]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/365\n| Rapid decompression<ref name=\"ATSB_200824\">{{cite press release\n  | title = Qantas Boeing 747-400 depressurisation and diversion to Manila on 25 July 2008\n  | publisher = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n  | date = 2008-07-28\n  | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/newsroom/2008/release/2008_24.aspx\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}\n</ref>\n| Fuselage ruptured by [[Oxygen tank|oxygen cylinder]] explosion\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 2294]]\n| 2009\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/131\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8150346.stm|title=Hole in US plane forces landing|date=2009-07-14|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 812]]\n| 2011\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/123\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/03/southwest-jet-pre-existing-fatigue/?test=latestnews | work=Fox News | title=Southwest Jet Had Pre-existing Fatigue | date=2011-04-03}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]]\n| 2014\n| [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]]\n| Shootdown\n| {{ntsh|298}}298/298\n| Explosive decompression\n| Shot down by a [[Buk missile system|Buk]] surface-to-air missile launcher;

An example of this is the 2005 [[Helios Airways Flight 522]] crash, in which the pilots failed to check the aircraft was pressurising automatically and then to react to the warnings that the aircraft was depressurising, eventually losing consciousness (along with most of the passengers and crew) from [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].\n\n==Pressure vessel seals and testing==\nSeals in high-pressure vessels are also susceptible to explosive decompression; the [[O-ring]]s or [[rubber]] [[gasket]]s used to seal pressurised pipelines tend to become saturated with high-pressure [[gas]]es. If the pressure inside the vessel is suddenly released, then the gases within the rubber gasket may expand violently, causing blistering or explosion of the material. For this reason, it is common for military and industrial equipment to be subjected to an explosive decompression test before it is certified as safe for use.\n\n==Myths==\n\n===Exposure to a vacuum causes the body to explode===\n{{See also|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}\n\nThis  [[Urban legend|persistent myth]] is based on a failure to distinguish between two types of decompression and their exaggerated portrayal in some [[fiction|fictional works]]. The first type of decompression deals with changing from normal atmospheric pressure (one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]) to a vacuum (zero atmosphere) which is usually centered around [[space exploration]]. The second type of decompression changes from exceptionally high pressure (many atmospheres) to normal atmospheric pressure (one atmosphere) as what would be found from [[deep-sea diving]].\n\nThe first type is more common as pressure reduction from normal atmospheric pressure to a vacuum can be found in both space exploration and high-altitudes [[aviation]].

In 1974, explosive decompression onboard [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] caused the floor to collapse, severing vital flight control cables in the process. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued an [[Airworthiness Directive]] the following year requiring manufacturers of wide-body aircraft to strengthen floors so that they could withstand the effects of in-flight decompression caused by an opening of up to {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} in the lower deck cargo compartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA Historical Chronology, 1926\u20131996|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}</ref>  Manufacturers were able to comply with the Directive either by strengthening the floors and/or installing relief vents called \"[[Dado (architecture)|dado panels]]\" between the passenger cabin and the cargo compartment.<ref>{{patent|US|6273365}}</ref>\n\nCabin doors are designed to make it nearly impossible to lose pressurization through opening a cabin door in flight, either accidentally or intentionally.

and the crew was able to take some immediate actions after vehicle breakup, although the loads experienced were  much higher as a result of the aerodynamic loads (estimated at 16 G to 21 G).5  The Challenger crew became  incapacitated quickly and could not complete activation of all breathing air systems, leading to the conclusion that an incapacitating cabin depressurization occurred. By comparison, the Columbia crew experienced  lower loads (~3.5 G) at the CE. The fact that none of the crew members lowered their visors strongly  suggests that the crew was incapacitated after the CE by a rapid depressurization.  Although no quantitative conclusion can be made regarding the cabin depressurization rate, it is probable  that the cabin depressurization rate was high enough to incapacitate the crew in a matter of seconds. Conclusion L1-5. The depressurization incapacitated the crew members so rapidly that they were not able to lower their helmet visors.}}</ref>\n| Damage to orbiter [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] at liftoff, leading to disintegration during reentry\n|-\n|[[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]]\n|2004\n|[[Bombardier CRJ100/200|Bombardier CRJ-200]]\n|Accident\n|2/2\n|Gradual decompression\n|Engine flameout\n|-\n|[[Helios Airways Flight 522]]\n| 2005\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Accident\n|{{ntsh|121}}121/121\n| Gradual decompression\n| Pressurization system set to manual for the entire flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/F15FBD7320037284C2257204002B6243/$file/FINAL%20REPORT%205B-DBY.pdf|title=Aircraft Accident Report \u2013 Helios Airways Flight HCY522 Boeing 737-31S at Grammatike, Hellas on 14 August 2005|publisher=Hellenic Republic Ministry Of Transport & Communications: Air Accident Investigation & Aviation Safety Board|date=Nov 2006|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] Flight 536\n| 2005\n| [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/142\n| Rapid decompression\n| Failure of operator to report collision involving a [[Ground support equipment|baggage loading cart]] at the departure gate<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/ |title=Airline Accident: Accident \u2013 Dec. 26, 2005 \u2013 Seattle, Wash. |website=Investigative Reporting Workshop |accessdate=2017-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120223757/http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/# |archive-date=2018-01-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907]]\n| 2006\n| [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|154}}154/154\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air collision\n|-\n| [[Adam Air Flight 574]]\n| 2007\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|102}}102/102\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air breakup\n|-\n| [[Qantas Flight 30]]\n| 2008\n| [[Boeing 747-400]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/365\n| Rapid decompression<ref name=\"ATSB_200824\">{{cite press release\n  | title = Qantas Boeing 747-400 depressurisation and diversion to Manila on 25 July 2008\n  | publisher = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n  | date = 2008-07-28\n  | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/newsroom/2008/release/2008_24.aspx\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}\n</ref>\n| Fuselage ruptured by [[Oxygen tank|oxygen cylinder]] explosion\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 2294]]\n| 2009\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/131\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8150346.stm|title=Hole in US plane forces landing|date=2009-07-14|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 812]]\n| 2011\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/123\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/03/southwest-jet-pre-existing-fatigue/?test=latestnews | work=Fox News | title=Southwest Jet Had Pre-existing Fatigue | date=2011-04-03}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]]\n| 2014\n| [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]]\n| Shootdown\n| {{ntsh|298}}298/298\n| Explosive decompression\n| Shot down by a [[Buk missile system|Buk]] surface-to-air missile launcher;

Ivan leaves the room while Raymond talks with Delaney and learns that she came to Erinsborough to see Leo Tanaka, as she fell in love with him while he was working at Raymond's club in Sydney. She then tells him that Leo was the one who went to the police about his money laundering, not Mannix. Raymond and Ivan decide to shoot Leo, and Raymond tells Ivan to get Leo alone so there are no witnesses. Ivan finds Leo in The Waterhole and fires the gun, but Terese Willis jumps in front of Leo taking the bullet. Ivan flees the scene and calls Raymond to tell him what happened. Raymond leaves Delaney and comes down to the complex, where he spots Leo and the police. He enters Harold's Caf\u00e9 and the customers assume he is just a hotel guest. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) find Ivan on Power Road trying to break into a car. Mark confronts him and Ned tackles him to the ground.\n\nRaymond tries to leave the caf\u00e9, but [[Elly Conway]] ([[Jodi Anasta]]) tells him to stay put as the police are continuing to sweep the area for Ivan's partner. She later tells him that he can go, but he notices that she does not tell anyone else and realises that she knows the police are looking for him. He pulls out his gun and orders Elly to collect all the phones, [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer) to lock the door and [[Chloe Brennan (Neighbours)|Chloe Brennan]] ([[April Rose Pengilly]]) to barricade it. He then hears [[Kirsha Rebecchi]] (Vani Dhir) on the phone to the police. He orders everyone to get on the ground, and asks the police to get him a van. Elly convinces him that he cannot take all the hostages with him, and he eventually lets an older couple and the children go. She tells him to just take her with him, but Chloe argues that he should take her instead. Raymond fires the gun at the ceiling and tells them to shut up. Leo comes to the caf\u00e9 and Raymond lets him inside, where he confronts his role in sending him and Ivan to prison. Leo asks him to think about Delaney, but Raymond refuses to listen and raises his gun to shoot just as the police come inside and tackle him to the ground.

Aaron later talks with Vera about how he and David have fallen in love with Regina, and he offers to buy her. Vera tells him that Regina was bequeathed to her, and if he wants Regina then they will have to go through a judge. David and Aaron eventually decide to let Regina go with Vera, who presents them with a vets bill before leaving for Bendigo. Vera later meets with [[Melissa Lohan]] (Jacqui Purvis) about selling Valerie's house. She then walks through the Lassiter's complex where [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) is vandalising a Valentine's Day display. He throws a large floral display which hits Vera and knocks her to the ground. Leo's family see that she is okay and ask her not to call the police. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) talks with Vera and asks her not to sue Leo. She mentions that his father [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) is actually the one with the money, and implies the accident could have happened to anyone with all the decorations hanging up, so Vera sues Lassiters. Vera comes to Lassiters to hear a public apology from Leo, but he gets into an argument with Paul and [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), causing Vera to leave.

She initially watches Chloe, Aaron and Elly Conway decorating the local pub, The Waterhole, and approaches Elly to comment that she and Chloe look like they are more than friends, but Elly tells her she is engaged to Chloe's brother. Mel comes to [[Ramsay Street]] to see Chloe, who shuts the door on her and refuses to talk to her. Mel tells Aaron that she is remorseful for stealing from Chloe and leaving her in debt, so he arranges for them to talk. Mel apologises to Chloe for leaving her and tells her she will pay her back. Chloe and Mel agree to be friends again. Mel reads about the Robinson Pines housing development and introduces herself to Paul Robinson in the hope of securing a job as a sales agent, but Paul turns her down as his daughter [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) has a team in place. Mel later comes by to see Chloe, who is about to send out an email invitation to the Robinson Pines sale, and she manages changes the time while Chloe is out of the room. The following day, Mel comes by the sale and helps Amy and Paul out by talking to potential investors, leading Paul to offer her a job as sales manager. Chloe kisses Mel and they spend the night together. Mel soon learns that Chloe is in love with Elly, but agrees to keep it to herself. She also convinces Paul to extend Robinson Pines and she meets with [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) to discuss selling his garage.\n\nDuring an outing to the beach, Chloe tells Mel that she has been diagnosed with [[Huntington's disease]]. Mel's supportive response leads Chloe to give their relationship a second chance. Mel purchases an office in the Lassiters complex, and pays [[#Heath Kabel|Heath Kabel]] (Tim Conlon) to turn away business at the garage. When he tells her that the apprentice [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]) is rebooking the cancelled job, she asks for his keys and starts a fire at the garage with a faulty power board, unaware that Bea is sleeping inside a van. Bea accuses Mel of starting the fire, after seeing her giving money to Heath. Lucas later agrees to sell the garage, along with other Power Road business owners. Chloe also accuses Mel of starting the fire, after learning that she threw out a faulty power board from Number 24. Mel denies everything, but Chloe tells her that she no longer trusts her and ends their relationship. Mel replies that no one will want Chloe when she becomes sick and leaves. Elly confronts Mel the following day for almost killing her sister, but Mel accuses her of undermining her relationship with Chloe, and threatens to tell Mark about the kiss.

Harlow feels pressured to have sex by Hendrix and they argue. She leaves and comes across Bea, who is trapped in a mineshaft with a broken leg. Harlow jumps down to help, but she also becomes trapped. Finn returns to check if Bea is still alive and throw rocks down. He then throws a snake down, which bites Harlow when she and Bea try to catch it in a rucksack. Gary tries to save them, but is killed by Finn, who also pushes Elly into the mineshaft. The others eventually find them, and they jump down to avoid a fire that engulfs the island. After being rescued, Harlow is taken to Erinsborough Hospital and placed in an induced coma. Paul blames Hendrix for Harlow's condition and initially bans him from seeing her. After waking up from her coma, Harlow listens to a voicemail on her phone, that was left by Prue and hears an explosion. She asks Paul where her mother is, and he tells her that she died. They later learn that she was killed by a bomb that Finn had left for Paul's sister [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actor)|Melissa Bell]]).\n\nHarlow was discharged from the hospital, but still mourn over the loss of her mother. Harlow kept Prue's final voice message from her phone and kept listening to it. Harlow drops her phone, and Paul and Terese learn that Harlow's been listening to Prue's voice message. Paul tries to take her phone and with a struggle, Paul accidentally deletes the message, upsetting Harlow. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]], was told by Hendrix of the incident and tells Harlow that the police has a copy of Prue's message and offers to give Harlow a copy of it, which is she accepts. Roxy hosts a memorial party for Prue, and Harlow was unable to join, but with some encouragement from Hendrix, Harlow joins the party. That night, Harlow walks Hendrix home, where she decided to sleep with him and they had sex. The next day, Harlow realised she regret of sleeping with Hendrix and told Terese and Roxy, but is unaware that Paul overheard it. Harlow is furious when Paul accuses Hendrix for taking advantage of her and threatening him to stay away. Harlow apologises to Hendrix for Paul's behaviour, but still clashes with Paul for being unfair with Hendrix. Harlow gets involved with a police raid with Mackenzie when the police raided inside Mackenzie's apartment that she shares with Mannix Foster, who is a criminal. Harlow continues to clash with Paul and refuses to talk to him. After getting some advice from David, Harlow apologises to Paul and they made peace, but she quickly learns from David, who confronts Paul for making Aaron hide stolen goods, that Mannix stole.\n\n==Mackenzie Hargreaves==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Mackenzie Hargreaves\n| portrayer = [[Georgie Stone]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{start date|2019|8|30|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n| spinoffs= ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n| occupation = Student\n| mother = Sarah Hargreaves\n| father = [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]]\n| aunts = [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]]\n}}\n'''Mackenzie Hargreaves''', played by [[Georgie Stone]], made her first appearance on 30 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28729021/neighbours-spoilers-elly-suffers-another-baby-scare|title=Neighbours spoiler: Elly suffers another baby scare|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/neighbours-mackenzie-georgie-stone-57103|title=Exclusive: Meet Georgie Stone, the amazing transgender activist about to star on Neighbours|date=22 July 2019|work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> She is the show's first transgender character,<ref name=\"Anderton\"/> and the second trans actress to portray a trans character on Australian television.<ref name=\"WW\"/> Stone's casting was announced on 23 March 2019.<ref name=\"Anderton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a26915706/neighbours-first-transgender-character-georgie-stone-guest-role/|title=Neighbours to introduce its first transgender character as Georgie Stone joins the soap in guest role|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=23 March 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> She had approached the show about introducing a transgender character in 2018.

When Yashvi fails an English test, Mackenzie suggests that she asks to resit it and explain the reason why she failed. Yashvi is sure she knows Mackenzie from some where, but Mackenzie assures her that they have never met and she has never lived in Bourke, where Yashvi and her family are from. However, Mackenzie later hides a Bourke keyring in her pocket, which later falls out in the cafe owned by Yashvi's parents. Fellow student [[#Richie Amblin|Richie Amblin]] (Lachlan Miller) asks Mackenzie to the school dance, but she turns him down as she might be gone by the time it happens. Mackenzie later comes to Yashvi's father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) and tells him that he used to know her mother, Sarah, and he was the reason she wanted to go to Erinsborough High. She asks him to find her father [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]] ([[Paul Mercurio]]), who she has not seen in years. When Yashvi suspects that Mackenzie is Shane's love child, he asks her to tell his family who she is. Mackenzie explains to Yashvi that she used to know her as Michael, and she tells the Rebecchi family that she has always known that she was a girl, but her father struggled to accept her, so she and her mother moved away. Now, she wants her father in her life. Yashvi apologises for jumping to conclusions.\n\nMackenzie panics when someone overhears Yashvi mention that she is trans, as she was bullied at her last school. Yashvi works out that it was Richie and accidentally outs Mackenzie while arguing with him. Mackenzie rejects Yashvi's apology, as she feels Yashvi does not know what she is apologising for. She also tells Principal [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she plans to stay at the school. Mackenzie later explains to Yashvi that not only did she out her, but she said that Mackenzie used to be a boy, which she finds offensive as she has always been a girl. She accepts Yashvi's apology, but asks for some time. Mackenzie and Yashvi reconcile after Yashvi tries to remove some transphobic graffiti from the girls' toilet door. Shortly after, Mackenzie finds a threatening note in her locker and Susan suggests Mackenzie use the disabled toilets, until the culprit has been found. Yashvi leads the students in a protest against the injustice, which Richie joins, much to the disdain of his friend [[#Ollie Sudekis|Ollie Sudekis]] (Ellmir Asipi). Susan realises that she has made a mistake and apologises to Mackenzie. Ollie makes transphobic comments to Mackenzie, resulting in Shane pushing him up against a wall. Mackenzie is grateful for Shane's support.\n\nAt [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) birthday party, Mackenzie meets and flirts with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland). She tells him that she is transgender, and he says it does not change anything, before they kiss. Shane gets a strong lead on Grant's whereabouts, and Mackenzie tells him about the day her father burnt all her feminine belongings. Shane later admits that he told Grant she was transgender. Shane's wife [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal) finds Mackenzie at a butterfly house, and convinces her to come back to Erinsborough. Mackenzie tells her that she cannot forgive Shane and will not speak to him again. Hendrix manipulates Mackenzie into asking him to the school formal. Shane and Dipi inform Mackenzie that Grant is coming to Erinsborough. Mackenzie's first interaction with her father is awkward, as he calls her by her old name. Grant says that Mackenzie is and always will be male to him, causing her to walk out. Yashvi and Harlow comfort her, and when she meets with Grant again, he makes an effort by calling her Mackenzie. She invites him to the school dance, but he fails to turn up and leaves town. Mackenzie neglects Hendrix to spend time with Yashvi and Harlow, and she later sees him kissing [[#Olivia Lane|Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan). Shane dances with Mackenzie during the father-daughter dance. She forgives him and assures him that Grant's views are not his responsibility. Mackenzie asserts that although she has not reconciled with her father, she still feels like she has found family in Erinsborough.\n\nIn the spin-off ''Erinsborough High'', Mackenzie and Richie admit their feelings for each other and begin dating, despite her concerns about Richie being more sexually experienced than she is. Before she can tell him that she has not had [[gender reassignment surgery]], Richie tells her that he knows as he did some research, and he still wants date her.\n\nThe following year, Mackenzie helps Harlow with her unexpected feelings for Hendrix. She contemplates studying law after finishing school, and asks [[Toadie Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) for advice.

Prue asks after Harlow, and learns that she has not mentioned Prue much. Prue explains that she is in the wellness industry and tells Paul and Terese about the philosophies she lives her life by. Prue notices a man, Graham, watching her and cuts the meeting short. As she walks off, Graham asks how it went and Prue tells him that Paul and Terese seem kind and are looking after Harlow. He then tells her that it is time to let Harlow go because if she is not with them, she is against them. Prue sends Harlow a text asking her not to worry if she does not hear from her for a while. Just over a month later, Prue comes to Erinsborough and voices her disapproval about Harlow's living arrangement, as Paul and Terese's hotel has been caught up in a sex tape scandal. Harlow defends them, but when Paul comes home drunk and Prue learns [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) is recovering from a stab wound, she wants to remove Harlow from the house. However, Prue is convinced to stay at Number 22. She later shames Paul's daughter [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) for being in the sex tape. Prue befriends [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) at The Waterhole and they go on several dates. Harlow worries that her mother has forgotten her, but Prue makes sure to prioritise her and they start to reconnect. \n\nPrue receives phone calls from the Restoration Order demanding payment, and she is tempted to steal from the till at The 82, but Gary catches her. She explains that the Restoration Order has helped her reach her full potential as a woman and mother, but she is worried that she will lose it all if she cannot pay the monthly fee. Gary asks to hear more about the Order and he later lends her the money she needs. Prue also attempts to convince Harlow that they could make a good life for themselves in London. When she catches Terese drinking wine, knowing that she is an alcoholic, Prue asks her to support her plan to take Harlow home to the UK and Terese agrees. Harlow decides to leave with Prue, unaware that her mother is still in the Restoration Order and planning on having her join. However, as they stop at a [[milk bar]], Harlow recalls Prue telling Terese to \"trust in the process\" and realises that she is still in the Order. Prue tries to defend her intentions and the Order, but Harlow tells Prue that she will not be joining up. She begs her mother to stay in Erinsborough with her, but Prue leaves her outside the shop and flies back to London.\n\nThe following year, Prue returns to Erinsborough claiming that she has left the Restoration Order. She tries to repair her relationship with Harlow. During a barbecue at the Cannings, Prue and Gary announce that they are engaged, shocking Harlow and Gary's family. After attempting to rebuild her relationship with Harlow, it is revealed that Prue did not leave the Order \u2013 rather, she was forced out due to a lack of finances. Upon finding out, Gary calls off the wedding and decides to join his son on the glamping trip. Prue takes the box containing their honeymoon destination and follows him in her car. She pulls over when she gets lost and leaves Harlow a voicemail. She then opens the box, looking for champagne, and is killed instantly by a bomb planted by [[Finn Kelly]] ([[Rob Mills]]).\n\n==Graham Isheev==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Graham Isheev\n| portrayer = [[Richard Arnold (presenter)|Richard Arnold]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| appeared = {{start date|2019|9|20|df=y}}\n| classification = Former; guest\n}}\n'''Graham Isheev''', played by [[Richard Arnold (presenter)|Richard Arnold]], appeared on 20 September 2019.<ref name=\"STimblick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/events/neighbours-spoilers-denise-van-outen-richard-arnold-guest-star/|title=Neighbours spoilers: Denise Van Outen and Richard Arnold guest star!|last=Timblick|first=Simon|date=10 September 2019|work=[[What's on TV]]|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> Arnold's casting details were announced alongside that of [[Denise van Outen]], who plays [[#Prue Wallace|Prue Wallace]].<ref name=\"Brown\"/> Arnold makes a one episode appearance in scenes set and filmed in London.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> He commented, \"I always knew my career would hit a 'dead end' eventually, but I never dreamed it would do so in such spectacular fashion joining the cast of ''Neighbours'', home to the most famous cul-de-sac in television.

He calls her by her old name, Michael, and reveals that he thought about contacting her after her mother died, but he was busy with work and was worried about what he would find if he did. Grant admits that he still thinks of Mackenzie as a boy, causing her to leave.

They do not get a chance to talk to Robert, who leaves when his father Paul Robinson enters the room. Harlow tells David, Aaron and Paul that she is Robert's daughter, and that her mother met him while backpacking in Tasmania. They invite her to stay with them in Erinsborough. Paul introduces Harlow to his fianc\u00e9e, [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), who she instantly bonds with, and invites her to live with them, after she says she wants to get to know Paul for herself. Paul initially struggles to talk to Harlow about Robert, but he eventually gives her a letter he wrote to his son that explains their relationship. Terese's niece [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) takes an instant dislike to Harlow and the two girls struggle to get along. Harlow enrols at Erinsborough High and befriends [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After Paul is attacked, Roxy claims that [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) is responsible. Harlow notices that Gary's mother [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) is nervous and soon finds that she has hidden a bloodied crowbar in her recycling bin. Harlow hands it into the police, who arrest Sheila. Roxy soon confesses that her former boyfriend attacked Paul. Harlow later calls out Roxy's immature behaviour when she realises Roxy has not apologised to Gary.\n\nTerese gives Harlow and Roxy the use of her daughter's car, Hermione, causing them to clash again when Roxy gives it a make-over. After Roxy tries on Terese's wedding dress and rips it, Harlow tells Terese what happened, but is surprised when Terese accepts that it was just an accident. When Roxy confronts her for telling Terese, Harlow throws food at her and they fight. They are interrupted by the arrival of Harlow's grandmother, [[Gail Lewis]] ([[Fiona Corke]]). Gail plans to take Harlow to Tasmania with her, after seeing how bad the relationship between her and Roxy is. She changes her mind when she learns that Harlow is doing well in school and wants to stay in Erinsborough. Harlow discovers Roxy has a casual relationship with [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and blackmails Roxy into doing her chores and giving her custody of the car. She also learns that Gail was involved in a conspiracy against Paul and encourages Gail to go and be with her daughter New York. She later tells [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) that she thought Gail came to Erinsborough to get to know her. Ned encourages her to say goodbye to Gail properly. While Terese and Paul are honeymooning in London, they decide to meet Harlow's mother, [[#Prue Wallace|Prue Wallace]] ([[Denise van Outen]]). Harlow tries to put them off and tells [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) that Prue is in a cult. After Mark publicly humiliates Roxy, Harlow and Sheila encourage her to end the relationship, which she does.\n\nHarlow repeatedly clashes with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland), who attempts to sabotage her presentation at school. During the school dance, Harlow confronts Hendrix for kissing another girl in front of his date [[Mackenzie Hargreaves]] ([[Georgie Stone]]). Hendrix kisses her and she slaps him. During a Melbourne Cup event at Lassiters, Harlow is injured when Hendrix crashes into a marquee, trapping her inside. Roxy frees her and Harlow thanks her for caring. She refuses to accept Hendrix's half-hearted apology. Days later, Harlow and Roxy find the Melbourne Cup trophy in the boot of their car. After taking some photos with it, they bring it back to Terese, who initially accuses Roxy of taking it, however, Harlow believes it was Hendrix and CCTV confirms he was responsible.\n\nWhen David gets involved in a hit-and-run accident, and needs a kidney transplant, Harlow couldn't be tested, as she's a minor. As non of the David's family members are a possible match for David, Harlow decide to turns to Robert, but Paul disagrees on her idea, but she went to him anyway, with Roxy. When Paul finds out, he is furious at Harlow for disobeying him, but agrees as David is running out of time. Robert goes to the hospital with the police, but later escapes. He calls Harlow to meet him, and she agrees to go. Harlow persuade him to save David, and he returns to the hospital with Harlow and the police. The surgery became a success and Robert returns to prison and David is recovering. Harlow decides to get private tutoring lessons and ask former school teacher [[Finn Kelly]]) [[Rob Mills]]) to tutor her. Harlow develop a crush on Hendrix and tells Mackenzie about her crush on Hendrix, [[Karl Kennedy]], overheard her and mistook her having a crush on Finn and told Finn's girlfriend, [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]). Harlow heard what happened and informs Bea that she doesn't have a crush on Finn, and Bea believes her.\n\nHarlow became suspicious of Hendrix, when he shows up to her home, shirtless and tries to seduce him in a classroom, but he pulls away and Harlow admits to him that she doesn't like him that way. However, her feelings for Hendrix continues. While practicing her driving lessons with Terese, Harlow accidentally hit and killed Terese's daughter [[Piper Willis]]' (Mavournee Hazel) cat, Clementine, while reversing the car through the driveway. Hendrix, who has a close bond with Clementine, blames Harlow for her death. Harlow decide to hold a funeral for Clementine and invites Hendrix to say goodbye. After burying Clementine, Hendrix apologises to Harlow for being harsh and Harlow gives Hendrix one of Clementine's toys. They almost kiss, but Harlow sneezes at Hendrix's face. Harlow attends to the Waterhole Mardi Gras party with Mackenzie and overheard Paul and Gary arguing about Prue returning to Erinsborough and is mad at Gary for not telling her. Hendrix comforts Harlow and they share a kiss. Harlow began to avoid Hendrix's texts, as she is stressed about her mother's return to Erinsborough, but later told Hendrix the reason why she didn't answer his messages.\n\nWhen Prue arrives, Harlow struggles to trust her, but she attends a welcome barbecue with Paul and Terese. There, Gary and Pure announce they are engaged. Harlow and Gary's son, [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) are opposed to the engagement and the wedding, which is happening at the Lassiter's Wedding Expo. Harlow and Hendrix talk about their kiss and she gently rejects him, preferring them to stay frenemies, which he accepts. Hendrix later tells her that he wants to earn her trust and asks her out on a date, which is a success. Prue convinces Harlow to be there at her wedding, but while planning Prue's hen's party, Harlow discovers a notification of an email from the Order on her mother's laptop. She realises that her mother lied to her and Gary about leaving the Order and she confronts Prue, before being comforted by Hendrix.\n\nHarlow and Hendrix decide to travel to [[Pierce Greyson]]'s ([[Tim Robards]]) island, where some of their friends and neighbours have gathered for [[Elly Conway]]'s ([[Jodi Anasta]]) birthday. They tell Paul and Terese that they are staying with friends, and set up camp away from the others. Harlow sends Gary a text message about Prue's lies. Harlow feels pressured to have sex by Hendrix and they argue. She leaves and comes across Bea, who is trapped in a mineshaft with a broken leg. Harlow jumps down to help, but she also becomes trapped. Finn returns to check if Bea is still alive and throw rocks down. He then throws a snake down, which bites Harlow when she and Bea try to catch it in a rucksack. Gary tries to save them, but is killed by Finn, who also pushes Elly into the mineshaft. The others eventually find them, and they jump down to avoid a fire that engulfs the island. After being rescued, Harlow is taken to Erinsborough Hospital and placed in an induced coma. Paul blames Hendrix for Harlow's condition and initially bans him from seeing her. After waking up from her coma, Harlow listens to a voicemail on her phone, that was left by Prue and hears an explosion. She asks Paul where her mother is, and he tells her that she died. They later learn that she was killed by a bomb that Finn had left for Paul's sister [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actor)|Melissa Bell]]).\n\nHarlow was discharged from the hospital, but still mourn over the loss of her mother. Harlow kept Prue's final voice message from her phone and kept listening to it. Harlow drops her phone, and Paul and Terese learn that Harlow's been listening to Prue's voice message. Paul tries to take her phone and with a struggle, Paul accidentally deletes the message, upsetting Harlow. [[Mark Brennan]], was told by Hendrix of the incident and tells Harlow that the police has a copy of Prue's message and offers to give Harlow a copy of it, which is she accepts. Roxy hosts a memorial party for Prue, and Harlow was unable to join, but with some encouragement from Hendrix, Harlow joins the party. That night, Harlow walks Hendrix home, where she decided to sleep with him and they had sex. The next day, Harlow realised she regret of sleeping with Hendrix and told Terese and Roxy, but is unaware that Paul overheard it. Harlow is furious when Paul accuses Hendrix for taking advantage of her and threatening him to stay away. Harlow apologises to Hendrix for Paul's behaviour, but still clashes with Paul for being unfair with Hendrix. Harlow gets involved with a police raid with Mackenzie when the police raided inside Mackenzie's apartment that she shares with Mannix Foster, who is a criminal. Harlow continues to clash with Paul and refuses to talk to him. After getting some advice from David, Harlow apologises to Paul and they made peace, but she quickly learns from David, who confronts Paul for making Aaron hide stolen goods, that Mannix stole.\n\n==Mackenzie Hargreaves==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Mackenzie Hargreaves\n| portrayer = [[Georgie Stone]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{start date|2019|8|30|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n| spinoffs= ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n| occupation = Student\n| mother = Sarah Hargreaves\n| father = [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]]\n| aunts = [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]]\n}}\n'''Mackenzie Hargreaves''', played by [[Georgie Stone]], made her first appearance on 30 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28729021/neighbours-spoilers-elly-suffers-another-baby-scare|title=Neighbours spoiler: Elly suffers another baby scare|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/neighbours-mackenzie-georgie-stone-57103|title=Exclusive: Meet Georgie Stone, the amazing transgender activist about to star on Neighbours|date=22 July 2019|work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> She is the show's first transgender character,<ref name=\"Anderton\"/> and the second trans actress to portray a trans character on Australian television.<ref name=\"WW\"/> Stone's casting was announced on 23 March 2019.<ref name=\"Anderton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a26915706/neighbours-first-transgender-character-georgie-stone-guest-role/|title=Neighbours to introduce its first transgender character as Georgie Stone joins the soap in guest role|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=23 March 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> She had approached the show about introducing a transgender character in 2018.

When Yashvi fails an English test, Mackenzie suggests that she asks to resit it and explain the reason why she failed. Yashvi is sure she knows Mackenzie from some where, but Mackenzie assures her that they have never met and she has never lived in Bourke, where Yashvi and her family are from. However, Mackenzie later hides a Bourke keyring in her pocket, which later falls out in the cafe owned by Yashvi's parents. Fellow student [[#Richie Amblin|Richie Amblin]] (Lachlan Miller) asks Mackenzie to the school dance, but she turns him down as she might be gone by the time it happens. Mackenzie later comes to Yashvi's father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) and tells him that he used to know her mother, Sarah, and he was the reason she wanted to go to Erinsborough High. She asks him to find her father [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]] ([[Paul Mercurio]]), who she has not seen in years. When Yashvi suspects that Mackenzie is Shane's love child, he asks her to tell his family who she is. Mackenzie explains to Yashvi that she used to know her as Michael, and she tells the Rebecchi family that she has always known that she was a girl, but her father struggled to accept her, so she and her mother moved away. Now, she wants her father in her life. Yashvi apologises for jumping to conclusions.\n\nMackenzie panics when someone overhears Yashvi mention that she is trans, as she was bullied at her last school. Yashvi works out that it was Richie and accidentally outs Mackenzie while arguing with him. Mackenzie rejects Yashvi's apology, as she feels Yashvi does not know what she is apologising for. She also tells Principal [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she plans to stay at the school. Mackenzie later explains to Yashvi that not only did she out her, but she said that Mackenzie used to be a boy, which she finds offensive as she has always been a girl. She accepts Yashvi's apology, but asks for some time. Mackenzie and Yashvi reconcile after Yashvi tries to remove some transphobic graffiti from the girls' toilet door. Shortly after, Mackenzie finds a threatening note in her locker and Susan suggests Mackenzie use the disabled toilets, until the culprit has been found. Yashvi leads the students in a protest against the injustice, which Richie joins, much to the disdain of his friend [[#Ollie Sudekis|Ollie Sudekis]] (Ellmir Asipi). Susan realises that she has made a mistake and apologises to Mackenzie. Ollie makes transphobic comments to Mackenzie, resulting in Shane pushing him up against a wall. Mackenzie is grateful for Shane's support.\n\nAt [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) birthday party, Mackenzie meets and flirts with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland). She tells him that she is transgender, and he says it does not change anything, before they kiss. Shane gets a strong lead on Grant's whereabouts, and Mackenzie tells him about the day her father burnt all her feminine belongings. Shane later admits that he told Grant she was transgender. Shane's wife [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal) finds Mackenzie at a butterfly house, and convinces her to come back to Erinsborough. Mackenzie tells her that she cannot forgive Shane and will not speak to him again. Hendrix manipulates Mackenzie into asking him to the school formal. Shane and Dipi inform Mackenzie that Grant is coming to Erinsborough. Mackenzie's first interaction with her father is awkward, as he calls her by her old name. Grant says that Mackenzie is and always will be male to him, causing her to walk out. Yashvi and Harlow comfort her, and when she meets with Grant again, he makes an effort by calling her Mackenzie. She invites him to the school dance, but he fails to turn up and leaves town. Mackenzie neglects Hendrix to spend time with Yashvi and Harlow, and she later sees him kissing [[#Olivia Lane|Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan). Shane dances with Mackenzie during the father-daughter dance. She forgives him and assures him that Grant's views are not his responsibility. Mackenzie asserts that although she has not reconciled with her father, she still feels like she has found family in Erinsborough.\n\nIn the spin-off ''Erinsborough High'', Mackenzie and Richie admit their feelings for each other and begin dating, despite her concerns about Richie being more sexually experienced than she is. Before she can tell him that she has not had [[gender reassignment surgery]], Richie tells her that he knows as he did some research, and he still wants date her.\n\nThe following year, Mackenzie helps Harlow with her unexpected feelings for Hendrix. She contemplates studying law after finishing school, and asks [[Toadie Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) for advice. Mackenzie attends to the Waterhole Mardi Gras party with Harlow and noticed Harlow and Hendrix staring at each other. Harlow tells Mackenzie about her almost moment with Hendrix and Mackenzie tells Hendrix to treat Harlow right. Mackenzie's aunt, Trish was moving and Mackenzie refuses to go, and decided to move in with the Rebecchis. But seeing how much stuff that has been going throw, she prefers not to ask.

She later places a suitcase behind porter [[#Trevor Nugent|Trevor Nugent]] (Warwick Sadler), causing him to trip over. With Trevor hospitalised, Ned offers Scarlett a job covering his shifts. To thank him, Scarlett buys them lunch, which is interrupted by Ned's girlfriend [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After they leave, Scarlett looks at a scrapbook, which contains information about her failed wedding and deceased family, and admires the selfie she took of herself and Ned.

Just as he goes to leave, Bea receives an electric shock. Ned helps break the connection and takes her to the hospital, making him late to meet Yashvi.

Scarlett uses the opportunity to get closer to Ned, and she learns that Bea has developed a heart arrhythmia from the electric shock. Scarlett soon declares that her former boyfriend Rex is stalking her, and Ned offers to stay over at Number 32 for the night. When she learns Yashvi is coming over, Scarlett lays down next to a sleeping Ned on the couch, so Yashvi catches them together. Yashvi then breaks up with Ned. Scarlett claims Rex has threatened her, and she later pays someone to throw a brick through the kitchen window, so Ned will stay with her. Scarlett initiates a kiss between them and they have sex, but Scarlett notices that Ned regrets it. She then tells Yashvi what happened and pretends to be attracted to [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) to make Ned jealous. \n\n[[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) learns that Scarlett has lied about working in hotels and attempts to fire her, but she reveals that she found a hidden camera in one of the rooms and will go to the press if he does. Scarlett pretends that she has lost her phone at The 82 and while she and Ned are looking for it, he is struck by a speeding motorbike and suffers a dislocated shoulder. Scarlett insists that Ned moves into Number 32 and she soon seduces him. Yashvi confronts Scarlett about her former boyfriend [[#Scott Mayfair|Scott Mayfair]] (Tom Jackson), who says that she tried to kill him, but Scarlett insists that Scott is lying. She then convinces Ned to leave town for a country B&B. To celebrate Halloween, Ned and Scarlett dress up, but Ned is thrown when Scarlett wears a wedding dress and starts talking about their future. Scarlett tells Ned they are meant to be together, but when he tries to leave, she stabs him with a cheese knife. She then chases Ned through the maze, as Bea and Yashvi enter to rescue Ned. Scarlett slashes Yashvi's leg, while Bea helps Ned to escape. He collapses by a tree, where Scarlett finds him and attempts to kill him. Yashvi tackles her to the ground and Scarlett is arrested. At the police station, Paul turns up to goad Scarlett, who replies with \"trick or treat\".
