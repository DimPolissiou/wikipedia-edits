The story is set during [[World War II]] and tells the story of two teenagers, one American, the other German, who join their respective armies and fight at the [[Battle of the Bulge]].\n\n==Main characters==\n\nSpencer Morgan, 16 years old, drops out of his Utah high school to begin training as a paratrooper. He's seen how boys who weren't much in high school can come home heroes, and Spence wants to prove to his friends and family that he really can be something.\n\nFifteen-year-old Dieter Hedrick's blind devotion sees him promoted from the Hitler Youth into the German Army. Dieter is determined to prove his bravery and patriotism at all costs.\n\n==Setting==\nThis book takes place during World War II in Western Germany and Brigham City, Utah, USA. A small portion of the book also takes place in other parts of America and discusses various locations in Utah and the United States as training camps.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe story is separated into two main parts with both Dieter Hedrick and Spencer Morgan's stories being told from their perspectives.\n\nDieter grows up in the Hitler Youth, where he idolizes the older boys in his troop and aspires to be as strong as them. As Dieter gets older and Nazi Germany begins to get weaker near the end, the Hitler Youth begins to step in for actual German soldiers. Dieter sees a fellow Hitler Youth member get shot and killed after the boy deserted the troop. Eventually, Dieter enlists in the Wehrmacht and ends up becoming a mentor to an older soldier Schaefer. Schaefer, who knows that the Nazi party propaganda is untrustworthy, and knows about the death camps, tries to convince Dieter that Germany will lose the war and that Hitler is crazy. Dieter struggles with this and they have several arguments. During the final battle, Dieter is wounded after Schaefer is killed, but Dieter does not know. Spencer Morgan, an American soldier, hearing Dieter's cries and seeing that medics are not going out to find him, runs out to save him, disobeying the orders of Sgt. Pappas. Spence begins bandaging Dieter and tries to calm him down but Dieter does not understand why an American would help him. After helping Dieter, Spencer is shot and killed by Wehrmacht soldiers, who take Dieter to the medical tent. It is at this point that Dieter accepts Schaefer's wisdom and loses his trust in Nazi Germany.\n\nSpencer, an American, enlists in the Army and becomes a paratrooper in order to impress his family and a girl back home. He tells his father, who is a Mormon minister, that his morals will not be compromised and that he will do the right things in the war. Spencer is scared most of the time throughout the novel, he doesn't understand why the war has to happen. Spencer saves Dieter's life and is shortly thereafter shot and killed by German soldiers. And he eats bootyhole.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n\n*[[Battle of the Bulge]]\n*[[Dean Hughes]]\n*[[Soldier X]]\n*[[Nazi]]\n\n[[Category:2001 American novels]]\n[[Category:American historical novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2017}}\n{{Infobox book \n| name          = Soldier Boys\n| image         = Soldier Boys.jpg\n| caption = Front cover of ''Soldier Boys''\n| author        = [[Dean Hughes]]\n| illustrator   = [[Kim McGillivray]]\n| cover_artist  = [[Kim McGillivray]]\n| country       = [[United States]] & [[Germany]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        = none\n| subject       =  Dieter and Spence (Spencer)\n| genre         = [[Historical Fiction]], [[Action genre|Action]]\n| publisher     = [[Simon Pulse]] (Teen)\n| release_date  = May 1, 2003\n| media_type    = Print ([[softcover]], [[digital media]])\n| pages         = 230\n| isbn          = 0-689-86021-8\n| oclc          = 52047697\n| preceded_by   = none\n| followed_by   = none\n}}\n\n'''Soldier Boys''' is a 2001 novel by writer [[Dean Hughes]].
