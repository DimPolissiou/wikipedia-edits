Sports promoter [[Barry Hearn]] is the PDC chairman.\n\nThe PDC developed and holds several championship competitions, including the annual [[PDC World Darts Championship]], the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]], [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]], [[UK Open]], [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]], and [[Grand Slam of Darts|Grand Slam]]. It also runs its own [[Darts world rankings|world rankings]] based on players' performances.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Split in darts}}\nIn the 1980s, professional darts in Britain lost much of its sponsorship television coverage. From 1989, the only televised event was the annual Embassy World Championship. Some of the players felt that not enough was being done by the governing body, the [[British Darts Organisation]], to encourage new sponsors into the sport and arrange more television coverage than just one event a year.\n\nAs a result, 16 professional players, including every previous BDO world champion who was still active in the game, created their own darts organisation, the World Darts Council (WDC), in January 1992.<ref>[http://www.planetdarts.tv/page/PDCHistory/0,,10180,00.html History of PDC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221121505/http://www.planetdarts.tv/page/PDCHistory/0,,10180,00.html |date=21 December 2008 }} pdc.tv</ref> The players were led by sports promoters Tommy Cox and Dick Allix, both of whom used their own money to fund the fledgling organisation.\n\n[[Image:wdcbadges.jpg|thumb|150px|The badges worn by WDC players at the 1993 World Championship]]\nThey wanted to appoint a [[Public relations|PR]] consultant to improve the image of the game. The 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last time there was one unified world championship. The WDC players wore their new insignia on their sleeves during the tournament but were told to remove them by the BDO.<ref>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/westondartsleague/DartsPages/history-darts.htm History of Darts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203065537/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/westondartsleague/DartsPages/history-darts.htm |date=3 December 2006 }} tiscali.co.uk</ref> The WDC players decided that if they were not going to be recognised by the BDO they would no longer play in the Embassy tournament.\n\nThe BDO took the step of banning the rebel players from playing in county darts and even threatened to ban any player who participated in exhibition events with WDC players.<ref>[http://www.theiceman.co.uk/split.htm Alan Warriner web site on darts split] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623103003/http://www.theiceman.co.uk/split.htm |date=23 June 2007 }} theiceman.co.uk</ref>\n\n===Tomlin order===\nThe WDC players took the matter to court in a dispute which accrued large and perhaps unaffordable costs during a protracted legal process. The two bodies reached an out-of-court settlement on 30 June 1997 in the form of a [[Tomlin order]].<ref>[http://www.bdodarts.com/Section%20L%20-%20World%20Professional%20Championship%20(Men)%20-%20Lakeside.doc Extracts from Tomlin order (see page 13 Word Document)]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} bdodarts.com</ref>\n\nThe BDO recognised the WDC and agreed that all players shall have the freedom of choice as to which open events they wish to play in. The WDC dropped its claim to be a world governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation. The PDC accepted and recognized the WDF as the governing body for the sport of darts worldwide, and the BDO the governing body for darts in the UK. The stated purpose of the agreement was to promote the freedom of individual darts players to participate freely in open competition.\n\nAnother condition of this Tomlin order is that the top 16 players, and any Home Country players ranked between 17 and 32 in each year's BDO Championship, and the top 16 players in each year's PDC Championship, shall not be permitted to enter the other competition in the immediately following year.\n\nDespite this condition, Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC within weeks of reaching the 2006 BDO final, later playing in (and winning) the 2007 PDC World Championship \u2013 the Tomlin order should have made him ineligible to play.<ref>[http://www.pdc.tv/page/PlayerProfile/0,,10180~1451704,00.html Raymond van Barneveld profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315005538/http://www.pdc.tv/page/PlayerProfile/0,,10180~1451704,00.html |date=15 March 2010 }} pdc.tv</ref> However it emerged that van Barneveld had negotiated a clause in his contract with the BDO, giving him the right to play in the PDC World Championship the year immediately after his last BDO World Championship.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-428255/King-fury-darts-chiefs-turn-heat.html King fury as darts chiefs turn up heat] dailymail.co.uk</ref>\n\nThere was further controversy following the 2007 BDO World Championship, when [[Jelle Klaasen]] announced that he would be switching to the PDC. As a BDO World Champion, he signed a three-year deal in 2006 to return to the Lakeside event. The BDO threatened to take legal action for breach of contract,<ref>[http://www.bdodarts.com/JELLEKLAASEN2.htm BDO Statement on Jelle Klaasen's PDC switch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209103457/http://www.bdodarts.com/JELLEKLAASEN2.htm |date=9 February 2007 }} bdodarts.com</ref> but with previous damage and costs incurred by other legal cases it has become less likely that any action will be taken in future with regards to player contracts and the Tomlin Order.<ref>[http://www.theoche.com/archives/55 Klaasen could face legal action over PDC switch] theoche.com</ref> 2007 semi-finalist [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] also moved to the PDC, seemingly against the contracted condition that semi-finalists and finalists were bound to appear the next year.\n\nIn January 2012, the PDC invited the four semi-finalists of the BDO world championships, after obtaining a written agreement to release any player without penalty. [[Ted Hankey]] was the first player to move,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/darts/16576334.stm Ted Hankey to lead exodus from BDO to PDC] bbc.co.uk</ref> as well as several players (who were not guaranteed a pro tour card due to not reaching the BDO semi finals) entering the PDC qualifying school, including [[Dean Winstanley]], [[Tony West (dart player)|Tony West]], [[Steve West (darts player)|Steve West]], and [[Stuart Kellett]].\n\n==Television coverage==\nFollowing the breakaway group's first televised event in 1992 (the Lada UK Masters on [[Anglia Television]]), satellite broadcaster Sky Sports signed a deal to exclusively cover three PDC tournaments each year. To capitalise on its investment, the channel introduced a number of new techniques{{vague|date=April 2018}} to make the coverage more interesting for armchair fans.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnlike the BDO world championship, which was covered via the general entertainment [[BBC Two]] channel, Sky's dedicated sports channel allowed the PDC matches to be covered in their entirety. Over ten hours per day of live darts on Sky Sports is not uncommon.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The British Darts Organisation's events were more limited to selected matches and highlights, although in recent years the BBC increased its [[interactive TV]] coverage allowing viewers to see many more events live.<ref>[http://www.theoche.com/archives/2023 2010 BDO Lakeside Men\u2019s Winner Will Take \u00a3100,000] theoche.com</ref>\n\nSky television is an advertisement and subscription based channel, and generally after each set a commercial break is taken. [[Planet Funk]]'s 2000 single \"[[Chase the Sun (song)|Chase the Sun]]\" is played in the auditorium and it has become a cult track amongst darts fans, who tend to dance along to the tune during the breaks.<ref>[http://www.pdc.tv/page/FAQs/0,,10180,00.html Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408110734/http://www.pdc.tv/page/FAQs/0,,10180,00.html |date=8 April 2010 }} pdc.tv</ref>\n\nCurrently [[Sky Sports]] broadcasts six tournaments live each year in both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. PDC events are also televised in [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]] ([[One World Sports]]).\n\nThe PDC signed a three-year deal with ITV in 2007 with the inaugural Grand Slam of Darts from 2007 and the inaugural Players Championship from 2009. The matches are shown live on ITV4 with highlights on ITV1. With ITV being an advertisement channel like Sky Sports, when commercial breaks are taken after 4 legs as the tournaments that ITV cover do not play in sets. [[The Fratellis]] 2006 single \"Chelsea Dagger\" is played during the breaks on ITV.  In 2010, Bravo signed a contract to show the European Championships.\n\nIn 2007, Sky Sports decided to extend their coverage of the [[Premier League Darts]] to 2010 following the high number of viewers to previous tournaments.<ref>[http://www.pdc.tv/page/PremierLeagueDetail/0,,10180~962208,00.html Premier League Darts to continue to 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617010551/http://www.pdc.tv/page/PremierLeagueDetail/0,,10180~962208,00.html |date=17 June 2010 }} pdc.tv</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced the [[BBC]] would cover the PDC for the first time with a new tournament being formed using the top 8 players on the [[PDC Order of Merit]] after the World Matchplay, known as the [[Champions League of Darts]]. As a result, the BBC dropped coverage of the BDO World Darts Championship, which they covered from 1978\u20132016 (this was the original World Championship prior to the formation of the PDC). [[DJ \u00d6tzi]]'s \"[[Hey! Baby#DJ \u00d6tzi version|Hey! Baby]]\" is played during the breaks on the BBC.\n\nIn August 2016, it was announced that [[Channel 4]] would be covering the BDO World Championship from 2017.\n\n===Cameras===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nSky Sports introduced more cameras to cover the sport, and many of these innovations have been copied by other broadcasters.\n\nUnique ''flight cams'' show the trajectory of the dart through the air in slow motion to sometimes surprising results. A tiny camera has also been inserted into the dartboard itself beside the number 16 \u2013 one of the most common doubles \u2013 that shows the darts being thrown towards the board. Sky Sports have also used a ''player cam''; a tiny camera was fitted to [[Dennis Priestley|Dennis Priestley's]] shirt to capture his view of the action while playing.\n\nElsewhere, floating video cameras capture the action of the watching crowds. Spectators become far more animated and vocal than their BDO counterparts, often acting similar to a football crowd, while holding up humorous placards \u2013 often featuring corny puns \u2013 regarding the players, and chanting or singing various songs related to the players or to the event in general. Some supporters even wear face paint or crazy costumes or they dress up as their favourite player via their trademark attire or customary nickname.\n\nThe players' wives have also been a focus for the cameras, as they cheered or screeched on their husbands. In January 2005, [[Sky 1|Sky One]] commissioned a programme entitled ''Darts Players' Wives'', primarily focusing on the wives and their relationships.\n\nIn December 2008, Sky started to broadcast darts in High Definition (with the exception of the final Las Vegas Desert Classic in 2009), and in July 2010 (at the World Matchplay), broadcast the Semi Finals and Final in 3D to around 1,000 licensed premises in the UK and Republic of Ireland.\n\nAnother frequent cam is a [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] camera, with the players on the right, and the dartboard on the left.  If the first two darts hit the triple 20, the camera will zoom in to the spot before the third dart is thrown.\n\n===Commentators===\n[[John Gwynne (commentator)|John Gwynne]] has covered all PDC events from the inaugural 1992 competition until his retirement in 2013. [[Dave Lanning]] covered all events up until December 2010, when he retired. Contrary to popular belief, long-time [[BBC]] darts [[sports commentator|commentator]] [[Sid Waddell]] did not switch allegiances to Sky until after the 1994 BDO World Championship. He brought his own unique brand of commentary to the game, and was a cult figure amongst darts fans and sport fans alike. He continued to commentate until his death in 2012. The current commentators on Sky include Nigel Pearson, Rod Studd, [[Stuart Pyke]] and former players [[Rod Harrington]], [[Wayne Mardle]], and three time World Champion [[John Part]]. Former BBC commentator and now Sky F1 commentator [[David Croft (broadcaster)|David Croft]] presents when [[Dave Clark (television presenter)|Dave Clark]] is unavailable and also occasionally provides commentary. [[Jeff Stelling]] was the original presenter of Sky Sports' darts coverage, but most of the events are now presented by Clark. In addition, the 2005 Premier League was fronted by [[Gary Newbon]].  Five-time world champion Eric Bristow was sacked in December 2016 by Sky Sports.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] events were fronted by [[Matt Smith (broadcaster)|Matt Smith]] from 2007\u20132014 but are now hosted by Jacqui Oatley from 2015 who became the first regular female darts host in the UK.  Commentary for ITV has been provided by [[John Rawling]], [[Alan Warriner-Little]] & Pyke since 2007 with [[Chris Mason (darts player)|Chris Mason]] joining the coverage in 2008. Former darts commentators for ITV include Jim Proudfoot, Peter Drury and Steve Beaton. [[Ned Boulting]] presents features and interviews and deputises if the presenter is unavailable.\n\nBBC Sport showed the inaugural PDC Champions League of Darts on BBC One and BBC Two, with 16 hours of coverage over two days presented by BBC Final Score presenter [[Jason Mohammad]] alongside PDC professionals [[Mark Webster (darts player)|Mark Webster]], [[Paul Nicholson (darts player)|Paul Nicholson]] and Warriner-Little, commentary by long time BBC darts commentator [[Vassos Alexander]] and PDC online reporter and commentator Dan Dawson with reports by Caroline Barker.\n\n[[Bravo (UK TV channel)|Bravo]] employed [[James Richardson (television presenter)|James Richardson]] and [[Dave Gorman]] to front its coverage until the channel closed in 2011.\n\n==Image==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nThe PDC sought to attract a younger audience of both sexes for darts and market the game as a night out rather than just as a sporting event. Through the years, it was not uncommon to see politicians, musicians, football players, boxers and other sporting personalities attending their events. The British Darts Organisation have subsequently sought to emulate most of these innovations.\n\nPlayers enter matches with their own signature theme music whilst flanked by security men and, until 2017, female valets down to the [[oche]]. A \"big-time\" atmosphere was also created by using smoke machines and [[pyrotechnics]] during these sometimes elaborate entrances, similar to those used in [[boxing]] or [[professional wrestling|wrestling]].\n\nAt the oche, players only drink iced water during matches. Though this was intended to further the game's image, which had been tarnished by players' reputation for consuming large quantities of alcohol. The water is also needed to prevent dehydration: with the many lights and packed crowds, temperatures have been measured at over 38 degree Celsius (100 degree Fahrenheit) during some games.\n\nInside the venues, action is relayed via giant video screens for the large crowds. The BDO now also has video screens, while maintaining their traditional \"light boards\" of lightbulbs, showing where each dart lands for the benefit of the crowd.\n\n===Nicknames===\n[[Eric Bristow]], the most successful player in the first few years of the World Championship, had his nickname \"The Crafty Cockney\" emblazoned on the back of his shirt. Very few dart players had their own nicknames until the Professional Darts Corporation circuit made it almost customary for every player to acquire a nickname. This helps to create a new generation of characters with which its audience could identify.\n\nSky TV commentator [[Sid Waddell]] attempted to christen [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] \"The Crafty Potter\" \u2013 referring to him being both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bristow and originating from the [[The Potteries Urban Area|Potteries]]. However, the tag never caught on and it was not until a later tournament that he came out to the tune ''[[The Power (Snap! song)|The Power]]'' by [[Snap!]] that his nickname was accidentally born.\n\n[[Jamie Harvey]] from [[Scotland]] became \"Bravedart\" \u2013 a play on words from [[Mel Gibson|Mel Gibson's]] ''[[Braveheart]]'' film. Sky Sports even filmed vignettes where a [[kilt]] wearing Jamie had his face painted blue and ran through woods throwing his darts whilst looking menacing.\n\nAs the only player to wear a shirt, tie and waistcoat whilst playing, [[Rod Harrington]]'s \"Prince of Style\" tag appeared apt.\n\nThough originally from the BDO circuit, [[Wayne Mardle]] is known as \"Hawaii Five-O-One\" due to his colourful [[Hawaii]]an shirts (a play on words on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' and the starting score in a leg of darts).\n\nBob Anderson, now living in [[Clevedon]] in [[Somerset]], is known as The Limestone Cowboy, after the limestone hills of Wiltshire where Bob used to live, and the fact that he enjoys Country and Western music. This was once taken even further, with Anderson once walking to the stage accompanied by a horse.\n\n==Current tournaments==\nThe Professional Darts Corporation has continued to increase its annual UK televised tournaments in recent years: The World Championship, The Premier League, World Cup of Darts, World Grand Prix and World Matchplay are all covered live by Sky Sports. The US Open was shown on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] in 2007 and [[Nuts TV]] in 2008. Bravo broadcast the European Championships for the first time in 2010, after ITV4 televised the first running in 2008. ITV 4 won back the coverage for the European Championship; they also show live coverage of the World Series of Darts, Players Championship, UK Open and the Masters.\n\n==Ranked tournaments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n===World Championship===\n{{Main|PDC World Darts Championship}}\nThe World Championship is a single-elimination seeded tournament beginning in late December and finishing in early January. It is the biggest of the PDC tournaments and has the largest prize fund of any darts competition. Held at the [[Circus Tavern]], [[Purfleet]] between 1994 and 2007, the championship moved to a bigger venue at [[Alexandra Palace]] from 2008.\n\n[[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] has dominated this tournament, reaching the final for the first 14 years between 1994 and 2007 and winning fourteen titles, including eight successive titles between 1995 and 2002. The PDC World Champions have also shared eight BDO World Championships between them, with Van Barneveld winning four, Taylor two, and Part and Priestley one each. These are usually added to each player's haul when describing their achievements \u2013 hence Taylor is a 16-time champion, van Barneveld 5, Part 3 and Priestley 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: left; width:70%\"\n|-\n!

Phil Taylor was leading the match 5\u20132 in sets before it was unexpectedly abandoned.\n\n===Masters of Darts===\n{{Main|Masters of Darts}} This event was staged twice in 2005 and 2007. In the 2005 Masters of Darts event four top players from both darts circuits together for the first major tournament confrontation since the two organisations separated.\n\nThe players were split into two groups, sharing it with only members of their affiliated organisation. Each player then vied against all players from the opposition, with one point awarded for winning a match. Following conclusion of the format, the winner of each respective group played the runner-up at the semi-final stage.\n\nThe Professional Darts Corporation pool consisted of Colin Lloyd, Wayne Mardle, Roland Scholten and Phil Taylor; whilst for the British Darts Organisation it was [[Tony David]], Andy Fordham, [[Co Stomp\u00e9]] and Raymond van Barneveld.\n\nIn a rematch of their unfinished 2004 head-to-head clash, Phil Taylor beat Andy Fordham convincingly in the final, 7\u20131, to be crowned the first Master of Darts. While beating Raymond van Barneveld (BDO World Champion at the time) 4\u20130 and 5\u20132 along the way, the undefeated Taylor only lost 5 sets during the entire tournament.\n\nThis event was broadcast to viewers in The Netherlands via [[RTL 5]]. Surprisingly, no British broadcaster had agreed television coverage of this unique event. The tournament was not held in 2006, however it returned in February 2007 as a Netherlands versus England encounter with five players from each country. Originally announced with a mixture of PDC and BDO players, the BDO players had all switched to the PDC by the time the event began.\n\n===World Darts Trophy===\n{{Main|World Darts Trophy}}\nThis tournament began as a BDO event.The tournament ran from 2002\u20132007.

Sports promoter [[Barry Hearn]] is the PDC chairman.\n\nThe PDC developed and holds several championship competitions, including the annual [[PDC World Darts Championship]], the [[World Matchplay (darts)|World Matchplay]], [[World Grand Prix (darts)|World Grand Prix]], [[UK Open]], [[Premier League Darts|Premier League]], and [[Grand Slam of Darts|Grand Slam]]. It also runs its own [[Darts world rankings|world rankings]] based on players' performances.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Split in darts}}\nIn the 1980s, professional darts in Britain lost much of its sponsorship television coverage. From 1989, the only televised event was the annual Embassy World Championship. Some of the players felt that not enough was being done by the governing body, the [[British Darts Organisation]], to encourage new sponsors into the sport and arrange more television coverage than just one event a year.\n\nAs a result, 16 professional players, including every previous BDO world champion who was still active in the game, created their own darts organisation, the World Darts Council (WDC), in January 1992.<ref>[http://www.planetdarts.tv/page/PDCHistory/0,,10180,00.html History of PDC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221121505/http://www.planetdarts.tv/page/PDCHistory/0,,10180,00.html |date=21 December 2008 }} pdc.tv</ref> The players were led by sports promoters Tommy Cox and Dick Allix, both of whom used their own money to fund the fledgling organisation.\n\n[[Image:wdcbadges.jpg|thumb|150px|The badges worn by WDC players at the 1993 World Championship]]\nThey wanted to appoint a [[Public relations|PR]] consultant to improve the image of the game. The 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last time there was one unified world championship. The WDC players wore their new insignia on their sleeves during the tournament but were told to remove them by the BDO.<ref>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/westondartsleague/DartsPages/history-darts.htm History of Darts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203065537/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/westondartsleague/DartsPages/history-darts.htm |date=3 December 2006 }} tiscali.co.uk</ref> The WDC players decided that if they were not going to be recognised by the BDO they would no longer play in the Embassy tournament.\n\nThe BDO took the step of banning the rebel players from playing in county darts and even threatened to ban any player who participated in exhibition events with WDC players.<ref>[http://www.theiceman.co.uk/split.htm Alan Warriner web site on darts split] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623103003/http://www.theiceman.co.uk/split.htm |date=23 June 2007 }} theiceman.co.uk</ref>\n\n===Tomlin order===\nThe WDC players took the matter to court in a dispute which accrued large and perhaps unaffordable costs during a protracted legal process. The two bodies reached an out-of-court settlement on 30 June 1997 in the form of a [[Tomlin order]].<ref>[http://www.bdodarts.com/Section%20L%20-%20World%20Professional%20Championship%20(Men)%20-%20Lakeside.doc Extracts from Tomlin order (see page 13 Word Document)]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} bdodarts.com</ref>\n\nThe BDO recognised the WDC and agreed that all players shall have the freedom of choice as to which open events they wish to play in. The WDC dropped its claim to be a world governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation. The PDC accepted and recognized the WDF as the governing body for the sport of darts worldwide, and the BDO the governing body for darts in the UK. The stated purpose of the agreement was to promote the freedom of individual darts players to participate freely in open competition.\n\nAnother condition of this Tomlin order is that the top 16 players, and any Home Country players ranked between 17 and 32 in each year's BDO Championship, and the top 16 players in each year's PDC Championship, shall not be permitted to enter the other competition in the immediately following year.\n\nDespite this condition, Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC within weeks of reaching the 2006 BDO final, later playing in (and winning) the 2007 PDC World Championship \u2013 the Tomlin order should have made him ineligible to play.<ref>[http://www.pdc.tv/page/PlayerProfile/0,,10180~1451704,00.html Raymond van Barneveld profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315005538/http://www.pdc.tv/page/PlayerProfile/0,,10180~1451704,00.html |date=15 March 2010 }} pdc.tv</ref> However it emerged that van Barneveld had negotiated a clause in his contract with the BDO, giving him the right to play in the PDC World Championship the year immediately after his last BDO World Championship.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-428255/King-fury-darts-chiefs-turn-heat.html King fury as darts chiefs turn up heat] dailymail.co.uk</ref>\n\nThere was further controversy following the 2007 BDO World Championship, when [[Jelle Klaasen]] announced that he would be switching to the PDC. As a BDO World Champion, he signed a three-year deal in 2006 to return to the Lakeside event. The BDO threatened to take legal action for breach of contract,<ref>[http://www.bdodarts.com/JELLEKLAASEN2.htm BDO Statement on Jelle Klaasen's PDC switch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209103457/http://www.bdodarts.com/JELLEKLAASEN2.htm |date=9 February 2007 }} bdodarts.com</ref> but with previous damage and costs incurred by other legal cases it has become less likely that any action will be taken in future with regards to player contracts and the Tomlin Order.<ref>[http://www.theoche.com/archives/55 Klaasen could face legal action over PDC switch] theoche.com</ref> 2007 semi-finalist [[Mervyn King (darts player)|Mervyn King]] also moved to the PDC, seemingly against the contracted condition that semi-finalists and finalists were bound to appear the next year.\n\nIn January 2012, the PDC invited the four semi-finalists of the BDO world championships, after obtaining a written agreement to release any player without penalty. [[Ted Hankey]] was the first player to move,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/darts/16576334.stm Ted Hankey to lead exodus from BDO to PDC] bbc.co.uk</ref> as well as several players (who were not guaranteed a pro tour card due to not reaching the BDO semi finals) entering the PDC qualifying school, including [[Dean Winstanley]], [[Tony West (dart player)|Tony West]], [[Steve West (darts player)|Steve West]], and [[Stuart Kellett]].\n\n==Television coverage==\nFollowing the breakaway group's first televised event in 1992 (the Lada UK Masters on [[Anglia Television]]), satellite broadcaster Sky Sports signed a deal to exclusively cover three PDC tournaments each year. To capitalise on its investment, the channel introduced a number of new techniques{{vague|date=April 2018}} to make the coverage more interesting for armchair fans.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnlike the BDO world championship, which was covered via the general entertainment [[BBC Two]] channel, Sky's dedicated sports channel allowed the PDC matches to be covered in their entirety. Over ten hours per day of live darts on Sky Sports is not uncommon.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The British Darts Organisation's events were more limited to selected matches and highlights, although in recent years the BBC increased its [[interactive TV]] coverage allowing viewers to see many more events live.<ref>[http://www.theoche.com/archives/2023 2010 BDO Lakeside Men\u2019s Winner Will Take \u00a3100,000] theoche.com</ref>\n\nSky television is an advertisement and subscription based channel, and generally after each set a commercial break is taken. [[Planet Funk]]'s 2000 single \"[[Chase the Sun (song)|Chase the Sun]]\" is played in the auditorium and it has become a cult track amongst darts fans, who tend to dance along to the tune during the breaks.<ref>[http://www.pdc.tv/page/FAQs/0,,10180,00.html Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408110734/http://www.pdc.tv/page/FAQs/0,,10180,00.html |date=8 April 2010 }} pdc.tv</ref>\n\nCurrently [[Sky Sports]] broadcasts six tournaments live each year in both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. PDC events are also televised in [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]] ([[One World Sports]]).\n\nThe PDC signed a three-year deal with ITV in 2007 with the inaugural Grand Slam of Darts from 2007 and the inaugural Players Championship from 2009. The matches are shown live on ITV4 with highlights on ITV1. With ITV being an advertisement channel like Sky Sports, when commercial breaks are taken after 4 legs as the tournaments that ITV cover do not play in sets. [[The Fratellis]] 2006 single \"Chelsea Dagger\" is played during the breaks on ITV.  In 2010, Bravo signed a contract to show the European Championships.\n\nIn 2007, Sky Sports decided to extend their coverage of the [[Premier League Darts]] to 2010 following the high number of viewers to previous tournaments.<ref>[http://www.pdc.tv/page/PremierLeagueDetail/0,,10180~962208,00.html Premier League Darts to continue to 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617010551/http://www.pdc.tv/page/PremierLeagueDetail/0,,10180~962208,00.html |date=17 June 2010 }} pdc.tv</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, it was announced the [[BBC]] would cover the PDC for the first time with a new tournament being formed using the top 8 players on the [[PDC Order of Merit]] after the World Matchplay, known as the [[Champions League of Darts]]. As a result, the BBC dropped coverage of the BDO World Darts Championship, which they covered from 1978\u20132016 (this was the original World Championship prior to the formation of the PDC). [[DJ \u00d6tzi]]'s \"[[Hey! Baby#DJ \u00d6tzi version|Hey! Baby]]\" is played during the breaks on the BBC.\n\nIn August 2016, it was announced that [[Channel 4]] would be covering the BDO World Championship from 2017.\n\n===Cameras===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nSky Sports introduced more cameras to cover the sport, and many of these innovations have been copied by other broadcasters.\n\nUnique ''flight cams'' show the trajectory of the dart through the air in slow motion to sometimes surprising results. A tiny camera has also been inserted into the dartboard itself beside the number 16 \u2013 one of the most common doubles \u2013 that shows the darts being thrown towards the board. Sky Sports have also used a ''player cam''; a tiny camera was fitted to [[Dennis Priestley|Dennis Priestley's]] shirt to capture his view of the action while playing.\n\nElsewhere, floating video cameras capture the action of the watching crowds. Spectators become far more animated and vocal than their BDO counterparts, often acting similar to a football crowd, while holding up humorous placards \u2013 often featuring corny puns \u2013 regarding the players, and chanting or singing various songs related to the players or to the event in general. Some supporters even wear face paint or crazy costumes or they dress up as their favourite player via their trademark attire or customary nickname.\n\nThe players' wives have also been a focus for the cameras, as they cheered or screeched on their husbands. In January 2005, [[Sky 1|Sky One]] commissioned a programme entitled ''Darts Players' Wives'', primarily focusing on the wives and their relationships.\n\nIn December 2008, Sky started to broadcast darts in High Definition (with the exception of the final Las Vegas Desert Classic in 2009), and in July 2010 (at the World Matchplay), broadcast the Semi Finals and Final in 3D to around 1,000 licensed premises in the UK and Republic of Ireland.\n\nAnother frequent cam is a [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] camera, with the players on the right, and the dartboard on the left.  If the first two darts hit the triple 20, the camera will zoom in to the spot before the third dart is thrown.\n\n===Commentators===\n[[John Gwynne (commentator)|John Gwynne]] has covered all PDC events from the inaugural 1992 competition until his retirement in 2013. [[Dave Lanning]] covered all events up until December 2010, when he retired. Contrary to popular belief, long-time [[BBC]] darts [[sports commentator|commentator]] [[Sid Waddell]] did not switch allegiances to Sky until after the 1994 BDO World Championship. He brought his own unique brand of commentary to the game, and was a cult figure amongst darts fans and sport fans alike. He continued to commentate until his death in 2012. The current commentators on Sky include Nigel Pearson, Rod Studd, [[Stuart Pyke]] and former players [[Rod Harrington]], [[Wayne Mardle]], and three time World Champion [[John Part]]. Former BBC commentator and now Sky F1 commentator [[David Croft (broadcaster)|David Croft]] presents when [[Dave Clark (television presenter)|Dave Clark]] is unavailable and also occasionally provides commentary. [[Jeff Stelling]] was the original presenter of Sky Sports' darts coverage, but most of the events are now presented by Clark. In addition, the 2005 Premier League was fronted by [[Gary Newbon]].  Five-time world champion Eric Bristow was sacked in December 2016 by Sky Sports.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] events were fronted by [[Matt Smith (broadcaster)|Matt Smith]] from 2007\u20132014 but are now hosted by Jacqui Oatley from 2015 who became the first regular female darts host in the UK.  Commentary for ITV has been provided by [[John Rawling]], [[Alan Warriner-Little]] & Pyke since 2007 with [[Chris Mason (darts player)|Chris Mason]] joining the coverage in 2008. Former darts commentators for ITV include Jim Proudfoot, Peter Drury and Steve Beaton. [[Ned Boulting]] presents features and interviews and deputises if the presenter is unavailable.\n\nBBC Sport showed the inaugural PDC Champions League of Darts on BBC One and BBC Two, with 16 hours of coverage over two days presented by BBC Final Score presenter [[Jason Mohammad]] alongside PDC professionals [[Mark Webster (darts player)|Mark Webster]], [[Paul Nicholson (darts player)|Paul Nicholson]] and Warriner-Little, commentary by long time BBC darts commentator [[Vassos Alexander]] and PDC online reporter and commentator Dan Dawson with reports by Caroline Barker.\n\n[[Bravo (UK TV channel)|Bravo]] employed [[James Richardson (television presenter)|James Richardson]] and [[Dave Gorman]] to front its coverage until the channel closed in 2011.\n\n==Image==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nThe PDC sought to attract a younger audience of both sexes for darts and market the game as a night out rather than just as a sporting event. Through the years, it was not uncommon to see politicians, musicians, football players, boxers and other sporting personalities attending their events. The British Darts Organisation have subsequently sought to emulate most of these innovations.\n\nPlayers enter matches with their own signature theme music whilst flanked by security men and, until 2017, female valets down to the [[oche]]. A \"big-time\" atmosphere was also created by using smoke machines and [[pyrotechnics]] during these sometimes elaborate entrances, similar to those used in [[boxing]] or [[professional wrestling|wrestling]].\n\nAt the oche, players only drink iced water during matches. Though this was intended to further the game's image, which had been tarnished by players' reputation for consuming large quantities of alcohol. The water is also needed to prevent dehydration: with the many lights and packed crowds, temperatures have been measured at over 38 degree Celsius (100 degree Fahrenheit) during some games.\n\nInside the venues, action is relayed via giant video screens for the large crowds. The BDO now also has video screens, while maintaining their traditional \"light boards\" of lightbulbs, showing where each dart lands for the benefit of the crowd.\n\n===Nicknames===\n[[Eric Bristow]], the most successful player in the first few years of the World Championship, had his nickname \"The Crafty Cockney\" emblazoned on the back of his shirt. Very few dart players had their own nicknames until the Professional Darts Corporation circuit made it almost customary for every player to acquire a nickname. This helps to create a new generation of characters with which its audience could identify.\n\nSky TV commentator [[Sid Waddell]] attempted to christen [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] \"The Crafty Potter\" \u2013 referring to him being both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bristow and originating from the [[The Potteries Urban Area|Potteries]]. However, the tag never caught on and it was not until a later tournament that he came out to the tune ''[[The Power (Snap! song)|The Power]]'' by [[Snap!]] that his nickname was accidentally born.\n\n[[Jamie Harvey]] from [[Scotland]] became \"Bravedart\" \u2013 a play on words from [[Mel Gibson|Mel Gibson's]] ''[[Braveheart]]'' film. Sky Sports even filmed vignettes where a [[kilt]] wearing Jamie had his face painted blue and ran through woods throwing his darts whilst looking menacing.\n\nAs the only player to wear a shirt, tie and waistcoat whilst playing, [[Rod Harrington]]'s \"Prince of Style\" tag appeared apt.\n\nThough originally from the BDO circuit, [[Wayne Mardle]] is known as \"Hawaii Five-O-One\" due to his colourful [[Hawaii]]an shirts (a play on words on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' and the starting score in a leg of darts).\n\nBob Anderson, now living in [[Clevedon]] in [[Somerset]], is known as The Limestone Cowboy, after the limestone hills of Wiltshire where Bob used to live, and the fact that he enjoys Country and Western music. This was once taken even further, with Anderson once walking to the stage accompanied by a horse.\n\n==Current tournaments==\nThe Professional Darts Corporation has continued to increase its annual UK televised tournaments in recent years: The World Championship, The Premier League, World Cup of Darts, World Grand Prix and World Matchplay are all covered live by Sky Sports. The US Open was shown on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] in 2007 and [[Nuts TV]] in 2008. Bravo broadcast the European Championships for the first time in 2010, after ITV4 televised the first running in 2008. ITV 4 won back the coverage for the European Championship; they also show live coverage of the World Series of Darts, Players Championship, UK Open and the Masters.\n\n==Ranked tournaments==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n===World Championship===\n{{Main|PDC World Darts Championship}}\nThe World Championship is a single-elimination seeded tournament beginning in late December and finishing in early January. It is the biggest of the PDC tournaments and has the largest prize fund of any darts competition. Held at the [[Circus Tavern]], [[Purfleet]] between 1994 and 2007, the championship moved to a bigger venue at [[Alexandra Palace]] from 2008.\n\n[[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] has dominated this tournament, reaching the final for the first 14 years between 1994 and 2007 and winning fourteen titles, including eight successive titles between 1995 and 2002. The PDC World Champions have also shared eight BDO World Championships between them, with Van Barneveld winning four, Taylor two, and Part and Priestley one each. These are usually added to each player's haul when describing their achievements \u2013 hence Taylor is a 16-time champion, van Barneveld 5, Part 3 and Priestley 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: left; width:70%\"\n|-\n!

After each round a draw is held where there is no protection for seeded players. This has earned it the nickname The [[FA Cup]] of darts.

Phil Taylor was leading the match 5\u20132 in sets before it was unexpectedly abandoned.\n\n===Masters of Darts===\n{{Main|Masters of Darts}} This event was staged twice in 2005 and 2007.

Each player then vied against all players from the opposition, with one point awarded for winning a match. Following conclusion of the format, the winner of each respective group played the runner-up at the semi-final stage.\n\nThe Professional Darts Corporation pool consisted of Colin Lloyd, Wayne Mardle, Roland Scholten and Phil Taylor; whilst for the British Darts Organisation it was [[Tony David]], Andy Fordham, [[Co Stomp\u00e9]] and Raymond van Barneveld.\n\nIn a rematch of their unfinished 2004 head-to-head clash, Phil Taylor beat Andy Fordham convincingly in the final, 7\u20131, to be crowned the first Master of Darts. While beating Raymond van Barneveld (BDO World Champion at the time) 4\u20130 and 5\u20132 along the way, the undefeated Taylor only lost 5 sets during the entire tournament.\n\nThis event was broadcast to viewers in The Netherlands via [[RTL 5]].

An adult worm is normally 4 to 10 m in length, but can become very large; specimens over 22 m long are reported. Typical of cestodes, its body is flattened dorsoventrally and heavily segmented. It is entirely covered by a [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]]. The body is white in colour and consists of three portions: [[scolex]], neck, and strobila. The scolex has four suckers, but they have no hooks. Lack of hooks and a rostellum is an identifying feature from other ''Taenia'' species.<ref name=kone/> The rest of the body proper, the strobila, is basically a chain of numerous body segments called proglottids. The neck is the shortest part of the body, and consists of immature proglottids. The midstrobila is made of mature proglottids that eventually lead to the gravid proglottids, which are at the posterior end. An individual can have as many as 1000 to 2000 proglottids.\n\n''T. saginata'' does not have a [[digestive system]], mouth, [[anus]], or digestive tract. It derives nutrients from the host through its tegument, as the tegument is completely covered with absorptive hair-like [[microtriches]]. It is also an [[acoelomate]], having no body cavity. The inside of each mature proglottid is filled with muscular layers and complete male and female reproductive systems, including the tubular unbranched [[uterus]], [[ovary]], [[genital]] pore, testes, and [[Vitelline duct|vitelline gland]]. In the [[gravid proglottid]], the uterus contains up to 15 side branches filled with eggs.<ref name=bog/><ref name=\"schmidt\">{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Larry S. Roberts, John Janovy|title=Gerald D.

Oncospheres enter the [[duodenum]], the anterior portion of the small intestine, and hatch there under the influence of [[gastric juices]]. The embryonic membranes are removed, liberating free [[hexacanth]] (\"six-hooked\") larvae. With their hooks, they attach to the intestinal wall and penetrate the [[intestinal mucosa]] into the blood vessels. The larvae can move to all parts of the body by the general [[circulatory system]], and finally settle in [[skeletal muscles]] within 70 days. Inside the tissue, they cast off their hooks and instead develop a protective cuticular shell, called the [[cyst]]. Thus, they become fluid-filled cysticerci. Cysterci can also form in [[lungs]] and [[liver]]. The inner membrane of the cysticercus soon develops numerous protoscolices (small scolices) that are invertedly attached to the inner surface. The cysticercus of ''T. saginata'' is specifically named ''cysticercus bovis'' to differentiate from that of ''T. solium'', ''cysticercus cellulosae''.<ref name=bog/><ref name=\"schmidt\"/>\n\n==Definitive host==\n[[File:T.saginata-egg.jpg|thumb|''Taenia saginata'' - [[oncosphere]]]]\nHumans contract infective cysticerci by eating raw or undercooked meat. Once reaching the [[jejunum]], the inverted scolex becomes evaginated to the exterior under stimuli from the [[digestive enzymes]] of the host. Using the scolex, it attaches to the intestinal wall. The larva mature into adults about 5 to 12 weeks later. Adult worms can live about 25 years in the host.<ref name=bog/> Usually, only a single worm is present at time, but multiple worms are also reported. In each mature proglottid, self-fertilisation produces [[zygotes]], which divide and differentiate into embryonated eggs called [[oncosphere]]s. With thousands of oncospheres, the oldest gravid proglottids detach. Unlike in other ''Taenia'', gravid proglottids are shed individually. In some cases, the proglottid ruptures inside the intestine, and the eggs are released. The free proglottids and liberated eggs are removed by [[peristalsis]] into the environment. On the ground, the proglottids are motile and shed eggs as they move. These oncospheres in an external environment can remain viable for several days to weeks in [[sewage]], rivers, and [[pastures]].<ref name=bog/><ref name=\"schmidt\"/><ref name=ort>{{cite book|title=Foodborne parasites|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9780387311975|pages=207\u2013210|author=Ortega, Ynes R.|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe disease is relatively common in Africa, some parts of Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and Latin America.<ref name=\"lange\"/> This parasite is found anywhere where beef is eaten, including countries such as the United States, with strict federal sanitation policies.

Since it is difficult to diagnose using eggs alone, looking at the scolex or the gravid proglottids can help identify it as ''Taenia saginata''.<ref name=\"schmidt\"/> Proglottids sometimes trickle down the thighs of infected humans and are visible with unaided eye, so can aid with identification. Observation of scolex help distinguish between ''T. saginata'', ''T. solium'' and ''[[Taenia asiatica|T. asiatica]]''. When the [[uterus]] is injected with [[India ink]], its branches become visible. Counting the uterine branches enables some identification (''T. saginata'' uteri have 12 or more branches on each side, while other species such as ''T. solium'' only have five to 10).<ref name=\"lange\"/>\n\nDifferentiation of the species of ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]'', such as ''T. solium'' and ''T. asiatica'', is notoriously difficult because of their close [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] resemblance, and their eggs are more or less identical.

Its infection is relatively harmless and clinically [[asymptomatic]].<ref name=bog>{{cite book|author=Bogitsh, Burton J.|author2=Carter, Clint E.|title=Human Parasitology|year=2013|publisher=Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780124159150|pages=244\u2013245|edition=4th}}</ref><ref name=kone>{{cite book|title=Koneman's Color Atlas and Textbook of Diagnostic Microbiology|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781730143|pages=1282\u20131284|author=Winn, Jr. Washington|edition=6th|author2=Allen, Stephen |author3=Janda, William |author4=Koneman, Elmer |author5=Procop, Gary |author6=Schreckenberger, Paul |author7= Woods, Gail |year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Taenia saginataD.JPG|thumb|left|''Taenia saginata'' [[proglottid]] stained to show uterine branches:  The pore on the side identifies it as a [[cyclophyllid]] [[cestode]].]]\n''T. saginata'' is the largest of species in the [[genus]] ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]''. An adult worm is normally 4 to 10 m in length, but can become very large; specimens over 22 m long are reported. Typical of cestodes, its body is flattened dorsoventrally and heavily segmented. It is entirely covered by a [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]]. The body is white in colour and consists of three portions: [[scolex]], neck, and strobila. The scolex has four suckers, but they have no hooks. Lack of hooks and a rostellum is an identifying feature from other ''Taenia'' species.<ref name=kone/> The rest of the body proper, the strobila, is basically a chain of numerous body segments called proglottids. The neck is the shortest part of the body, and consists of immature proglottids. The midstrobila is made of mature proglottids that eventually lead to the gravid proglottids, which are at the posterior end. An individual can have as many as 1000 to 2000 proglottids.\n\n''T. saginata'' does not have a [[digestive system]], mouth, [[anus]], or digestive tract. It derives nutrients from the host through its tegument, as the tegument is completely covered with absorptive hair-like [[microtriches]]. It is also an [[acoelomate]], having no body cavity. The inside of each mature proglottid is filled with muscular layers and complete male and female reproductive systems, including the tubular unbranched [[uterus]], [[ovary]], [[genital]] pore, testes, and [[Vitelline duct|vitelline gland]]. In the [[gravid proglottid]], the uterus contains up to 15 side branches filled with eggs.<ref name=bog/><ref name=\"schmidt\">{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Larry S. Roberts, John Janovy|title=Gerald D.

Roberts' Foundations of parasitology|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-128458-5|edition=8th |year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==Intermediate host==\nCattle acquire the embryonated eggs, the oncospheres, when they eat contaminated food. Oncospheres enter the [[duodenum]], the anterior portion of the small intestine, and hatch there under the influence of [[gastric juices]]. The embryonic membranes are removed, liberating free [[hexacanth]] (\"six-hooked\") larvae. With their hooks, they attach to the intestinal wall and penetrate the [[intestinal mucosa]] into the blood vessels. The larvae can move to all parts of the body by the general [[circulatory system]], and finally settle in [[skeletal muscles]] within 70 days. Inside the tissue, they cast off their hooks and instead develop a protective cuticular shell, called the [[cyst]]. Thus, they become fluid-filled cysticerci. Cysterci can also form in [[lungs]] and [[liver]]. The inner membrane of the cysticercus soon develops numerous protoscolices (small scolices) that are invertedly attached to the inner surface. The cysticercus of ''T. saginata'' is specifically named ''cysticercus bovis'' to differentiate from that of ''T. solium'', ''cysticercus cellulosae''.<ref name=bog/><ref name=\"schmidt\"/>\n\n==Definitive host==\n[[File:T.saginata-egg.jpg|thumb|''Taenia saginata'' - [[oncosphere]]]]\nHumans contract infective cysticerci by eating raw or undercooked meat. Once reaching the [[jejunum]], the inverted scolex becomes evaginated to the exterior under stimuli from the [[digestive enzymes]] of the host. Using the scolex, it attaches to the intestinal wall. The larva mature into adults about 5 to 12 weeks later. Adult worms can live about 25 years in the host.<ref name=bog/> Usually, only a single worm is present at time, but multiple worms are also reported. In each mature proglottid, self-fertilisation produces [[zygotes]], which divide and differentiate into embryonated eggs called [[oncosphere]]s. With thousands of oncospheres, the oldest gravid proglottids detach. Unlike in other ''Taenia'', gravid proglottids are shed individually. In some cases, the proglottid ruptures inside the intestine, and the eggs are released. The free proglottids and liberated eggs are removed by [[peristalsis]] into the environment. On the ground, the proglottids are motile and shed eggs as they move. These oncospheres in an external environment can remain viable for several days to weeks in [[sewage]], rivers, and [[pastures]].<ref name=bog/><ref name=\"schmidt\"/><ref name=ort>{{cite book|title=Foodborne parasites|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9780387311975|pages=207\u2013210|author=Ortega, Ynes R.|year=2006}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe disease is relatively common in Africa, some parts of Eastern Europe, the Philippines, and Latin America.<ref name=\"lange\"/> This parasite is found anywhere where beef is eaten, including countries such as the United States, with strict federal sanitation policies.

[[Feces]] are examined to find parasite eggs. The eggs look like other eggs from the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Taeniidae]], so it is only possible to identify the eggs to the family, not to the species level. Since it is difficult to diagnose using eggs alone, looking at the scolex or the gravid proglottids can help identify it as ''Taenia saginata''.<ref name=\"schmidt\"/> Proglottids sometimes trickle down the thighs of infected humans and are visible with unaided eye, so can aid with identification. Observation of scolex help distinguish between ''T. saginata'', ''T. solium'' and ''[[Taenia asiatica|T. asiatica]]''. When the [[uterus]] is injected with [[India ink]], its branches become visible. Counting the uterine branches enables some identification (''T. saginata'' uteri have 12 or more branches on each side, while other species such as ''T. solium'' only have five to 10).<ref name=\"lange\"/>\n\nDifferentiation of the species of ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]'', such as ''T. solium'' and ''T. asiatica'', is notoriously difficult because of their close [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] resemblance, and their eggs are more or less identical.
