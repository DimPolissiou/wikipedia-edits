Though it was not as successful as Picha's [[Tarzoon, la honte de la jungle|previous film]], it was entered into the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1841/year/1980.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Missing Link |accessdate=2009-05-28|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 196303 BC. A group of [[cavemen]] rises from the mud, and the first thing on their minds is finding something to eat. After two unsuccessful attempts, the group decides to eat one of their own. Suddenly, the men meet [[women]], but don't know how to [[Sexual intercourse|make love]] to them. The elder of the men sees a pair of [[stegosaurus]] performing [[Doggy style|doggystyle]], which inspires the elder to do the same thing with one of the women. Nine months later, that same woman is pregnant with two boys, Ah and O. The cavemen like Ah, but are frightened by O and abandon him. Meanwhile, a [[brontosaurus]] abandons one of her eggs. Both O and the baby brontosaurus Igua meet, and instantly become friends.\n\nYears later, while trying to feed O, Igua comes across a stranded egg. Before O can try to eat it, the egg hatches and inside it is a baby [[pterodactyl]] named Croak. Croak and O become friends as well, but Igua becomes jealous and doesn't want O to see Croak again. As O grows up into an adult, he meets up with Croak again, who tries to help O become smarter. Their first \"lesson\" is how to fly. As O tries to fly, Igua steps in and takes O away. The next day, O looks in a pool of water and sees his [[Specular reflection|reflection]] and discovers that he's a man, not a brontosaurus. He decides to leave Igua and search for his own kind. As O sets out into the jungle, he runs into several creatures that he mistakes for men, including a [[wild boar]] and a giant [[worm]]. At nightfall, O becomes lost in the jungle and has an encounter with a menagerie of unusual creatures that nearly kill him. However, he soon finds Croak and the two fly away together. While flying, Croak accidentally crashes into a [[dimorphodon]] and drops O, thus separating the two.\n\nElsewhere, Igua tries to get together with his own kind. He finds a group of brontosauruses at a nearby lake, but they reject him due to Igua smelling too much like \"man\". Igua is crushed and decides to find O. As O begins to search for man, he comes across a group of workaholic creatures named \"No-Lobes\". They let him stay, but O causes chaos, which results in O discovering the [[wheel]]. After O destroys the No-Lobes's crops with the wheel, he is kicked out and the quest for man continues. While exploring, O is caught by a feline creature with a long tail, which she uses to seduce her victims before eating them. O decides to name her \"No-man\". \"No-man\" uses her tail to seduce O, then drags him off to her own kind. Before the felines eat him, they are distracted by a new-born baby. O and \"No-man\", who has a change of heart, run off together, with the others quickly behind them. O and \"No-man\" give them the slip, then they both have [[sex]]. While the two sleep, they are interrupted by a stampede of giant turtles. The feline tribe catches up with them, and catches \"No-man\". O uses a lone giant turtle shell and a couple of wheels to ride up to the tribe and tries to catch \"No-man\", but misses. O rolls off into the desert, leaving \"No-man\" to have her tail cut off. O crashes into a palm tree in the middle of the [[desert]] and is left to walk again.\n\nLater, O runs into Croak again. O is in need of [[water]], and Croak just happens to be searching for water. They find what appears to be water, but before O can drink, he is stopped by a [[dragon]]. The dragon tries to breathe fire at O, but it comes out his [[anus]] instead. To get water, O decides to help the dragon by sticking a [[cork (material)|cork]] up the dragon's butt. This causes the dragon to breathe fire from his mouth. The dragon thanks O and lets him drink. However, the watering hole is in fact a [[tar pit]], but the dragon gives him a lift to a nearby lake. After O drinks plenty of water, he takes a brief nap. When he wakes up, he sees that he's tied down to the ground by a [[colony]] of [[ants]]. O gets himself free and climbs up a tall building made out of grass, which cracks and sends O crashing into a pool of water, which drowns half of the ants. O continues on to the [[Arctic]], and meets up with a group of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] barbarians. O shows them [[fire]], which intrigues the group. They use their fur coats to light up the fire even more, but the fire melts the ice and their coats are lost in the bottom of the ocean. The group chases after O, but Croak flies in and saves him. As Croak flies O to safety, O is eaten by a [[shark]]. O eventually escapes from the shark and finally meets his human family.\n\nThe elder recognizes O and instantly dies. O takes over as leader and tells them that he'll teach man what he has learned on his travels. While teaching them, Igua finally catches up with O. However, O is still angry at Igua. Meanwhile, Ah (O's brother, though neither of them know that they are related) takes over as leader and shoves O away into the fire that was made by Ah. Igua saves him, and both O and Igua reconcile their friendship. Ah (in caveman talk) tells his people that they must show the world who is boss. They set out reshaping the earth in their own image and destroy any creature standing in their way. As a result, the dragon disappears from the face of the earth, the No-Lobes are all exterminated in a war against Ah, the dinosaurs drive themselves to [[extinction]] by committing mass [[suicide]], the feline clan is slaughtered and used for clothing and jewelry (save for No-Man, who later dumps O), and the ant colony attempts to escape via a rocket made of grass, which ends up crashing back down and killing them all, as well as causing [[Pangaea]] to split into the earth's [[continents]]. O, Croak and Igua escape the devastation and soon find a [[deserted island]] where they spend the rest of their lives, with O taking upon the title of the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] and contemplating the severity of his actions.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Original\n!English\n|-\n!O\n|[[Richard Darbois]]\n|[[Ron Venable]]\n|-\n!Igua\n|[[Georges Aminel]]\n|[[John Graham (actor)|John Graham]]\n|-\n!Croak\n|[[Roger Carel]]\n|[[Bob Kaliban]]\n|-\n!No-Lobes\n|[[Jacques Ferriere]]<br>[[William Sabatier]]<br>[[Georges Aminel]]<br>[[Roger Carel]]\n|[[Christopher Guest]]<br>[[Clark Warren]]<br>Bob Kaliban\n|-\n!Dragon\n|[[Philippe Nicaud]]\n|[[Bill Murray]]\n|-\n!Narrator\n|[[Jacques Dacqmine]]\n|[[Mark Smith (actor)|Mark Smith]]\n|}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBecause of the remarkable success of the 1975 film, ''[[Tarzoon, la honte de la jungle]]'', Picha was encouraged to address another subject, that of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and his theory of [[evolution]]. More ambitious than the previous film, production lasted from 1977 to 1979. [[Animation]] took place in [[Belgium]], [[New York City]], [[France]], and [[London]].

Though it was not as successful as Picha's [[Tarzoon, la honte de la jungle|previous film]], it was entered into the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1841/year/1980.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Missing Link |accessdate=2009-05-28|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 196303 BC. A group of [[cavemen]] rises from the mud, and the first thing on their minds is finding something to eat. After two unsuccessful attempts, the group decides to eat one of their own. Suddenly, the men meet [[women]], but don't know how to [[Sexual intercourse|make love]] to them. The elder of the men sees a pair of [[stegosaurus]] performing [[Doggy style|doggystyle]], which inspires the elder to do the same thing with one of the women. Nine months later, that same woman is pregnant with two boys, Ah and O. The cavemen like Ah, but are frightened by O and abandon him. Meanwhile, a [[brontosaurus]] abandons one of her eggs. Both O and the baby brontosaurus Igua meet, and instantly become friends.\n\nYears later, while trying to feed O, Igua comes across a stranded egg. Before O can try to eat it, the egg hatches and inside it is a baby [[pterodactyl]] named Croak. Croak and O become friends as well, but Igua becomes jealous and doesn't want O to see Croak again. As O grows up into an adult, he meets up with Croak again, who tries to help O become smarter. Their first \"lesson\" is how to fly. As O tries to fly, Igua steps in and takes O away. The next day, O looks in a pool of water and sees his [[Specular reflection|reflection]] and discovers that he's a man, not a brontosaurus. He decides to leave Igua and search for his own kind. As O sets out into the jungle, he runs into several creatures that he mistakes for men, including a [[wild boar]] and a giant [[worm]]. At nightfall, O becomes lost in the jungle and has an encounter with a menagerie of unusual creatures that nearly kill him. However, he soon finds Croak and the two fly away together. While flying, Croak accidentally crashes into a [[dimorphodon]] and drops O, thus separating the two.\n\nElsewhere, Igua tries to get together with his own kind. He finds a group of brontosauruses at a nearby lake, but they reject him due to Igua smelling too much like \"man\". Igua is crushed and decides to find O. As O begins to search for man, he comes across a group of workaholic creatures named \"No-Lobes\". They let him stay, but O causes chaos, which results in O discovering the [[wheel]]. After O destroys the No-Lobes's crops with the wheel, he is kicked out and the quest for man continues. While exploring, O is caught by a feline creature with a long tail, which she uses to seduce her victims before eating them. O decides to name her \"No-man\". \"No-man\" uses her tail to seduce O, then drags him off to her own kind. Before the felines eat him, they are distracted by a new-born baby. O and \"No-man\", who has a change of heart, run off together, with the others quickly behind them. O and \"No-man\" give them the slip, then they both have [[sex]]. While the two sleep, they are interrupted by a stampede of giant turtles. The feline tribe catches up with them, and catches \"No-man\". O uses a lone giant turtle shell and a couple of wheels to ride up to the tribe and tries to catch \"No-man\", but misses. O rolls off into the desert, leaving \"No-man\" to have her tail cut off. O crashes into a palm tree in the middle of the [[desert]] and is left to walk again.\n\nLater, O runs into Croak again. O is in need of [[water]], and Croak just happens to be searching for water. They find what appears to be water, but before O can drink, he is stopped by a [[dragon]]. The dragon tries to breathe fire at O, but it comes out his [[anus]] instead. To get water, O decides to help the dragon by sticking a [[cork (material)|cork]] up the dragon's butt. This causes the dragon to breathe fire from his mouth. The dragon thanks O and lets him drink. However, the watering hole is in fact a [[tar pit]], but the dragon gives him a lift to a nearby lake. After O drinks plenty of water, he takes a brief nap. When he wakes up, he sees that he's tied down to the ground by a [[colony]] of [[ants]]. O gets himself free and climbs up a tall building made out of grass, which cracks and sends O crashing into a pool of water, which drowns half of the ants. O continues on to the [[Arctic]], and meets up with a group of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] barbarians. O shows them [[fire]], which intrigues the group. They use their fur coats to light up the fire even more, but the fire melts the ice and their coats are lost in the bottom of the ocean. The group chases after O, but Croak flies in and saves him. As Croak flies O to safety, O is eaten by a [[shark]]. O eventually escapes from the shark and finally meets his human family.\n\nThe elder recognizes O and instantly dies. O takes over as leader and tells them that he'll teach man what he has learned on his travels. While teaching them, Igua finally catches up with O. However, O is still angry at Igua. Meanwhile, Ah (O's brother, though neither of them know that they are related) takes over as leader and shoves O away into the fire that was made by Ah. Igua saves him, and both O and Igua reconcile their friendship. Ah (in caveman talk) tells his people that they must show the world who is boss. They set out reshaping the earth in their own image and destroy any creature standing in their way. As a result, the dragon disappears from the face of the earth, the No-Lobes are all exterminated in a war against Ah, the dinosaurs drive themselves to [[extinction]] by committing mass [[suicide]], the feline clan is slaughtered and used for clothing and jewelry (save for No-Man, who later dumps O), and the ant colony attempts to escape via a rocket made of grass, which ends up crashing back down and killing them all, as well as causing [[Pangaea]] to split into the earth's [[continents]]. O, Croak and Igua escape the devastation and soon find a [[deserted island]] where they spend the rest of their lives, with O taking upon the title of the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] and contemplating the severity of his actions.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!Original\n!English\n|-\n!O\n|[[Richard Darbois]]\n|[[Ron Venable]]\n|-\n!Igua\n|[[Georges Aminel]]\n|[[John Graham (actor)|John Graham]]\n|-\n!Croak\n|[[Roger Carel]]\n|[[Bob Kaliban]]\n|-\n!No-Lobes\n|[[Jacques Ferriere]]<br>[[William Sabatier]]<br>[[Georges Aminel]]<br>[[Roger Carel]]\n|[[Christopher Guest]]<br>[[Clark Warren]]<br>Bob Kaliban\n|-\n!Dragon\n|[[Philippe Nicaud]]\n|[[Bill Murray]]\n|-\n!Narrator\n|[[Jacques Dacqmine]]\n|[[Mark Smith (actor)|Mark Smith]]\n|}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBecause of the remarkable success of the 1975 film, ''[[Tarzoon, la honte de la jungle]]'', Picha was encouraged to address another subject, that of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and his theory of [[evolution]].

(January 2006)]]\n[[File:R W Forsyth by William Reid Dick, People's Palace, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|''R W Forsyth'' by William Reid Dick, [[People's Palace, Glasgow]]]]\n'''Sir William Reid Dick''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCVO|RA}} (1879\u20131961) was a Scottish sculptor known for his innovative stylisation of form in his monument sculptures and simplicity in his portraits.  He became an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1921, and a Royal Academician in 1928.  Dick served as president of the [[Royal Society of British Sculptors]] from 1933 to 1938. He was knighted by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in 1935. He was [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] to King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] from 1938 until his death.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn in [[Glasgow]], Dick was apprenticed to a stonemason at the age of twelve and during the next five years he learned to carve stone at work, and at night took drawing and modelling classes. He completed his apprenticeship in 1896.  In 1907, he graduated from the [[Glasgow School of Art]] and accepted a teaching position at [[Bellshill Academy]] in Lanarkshire. By 1908 he was living in London and exhibiting in galleries and took evening classes at South London Technical School of Art whilst working for the sculptor Edwin Whitney-Smith.\n\n==War service==\n{{Tone|date=May 2016}}\nIn September 1914 with his reputation as a sculptor growing, Reid Dick joined the Territorial Army and from 1915 to 1919 served with the Royal Engineers in both France and Palestine. Reid Dick's Service Record has fortunately been preserved as part of the \"Burnt Records\" series at the National Archives in Kew and can be found under reference WO 363/MIS-SORTS 34/52.   From this file we learn that when Reid Dick signed up on 1 September 1914 he joined the 5th London Field Ambulance section of the Royal Army Medical Corps with regimental number 1752. He was 34 years and 4 months of age and gave his address as 1 St John's Wood Studios, Queens Terrace, St John's Wood. His wife Catherine was shown as \"next of kin\". Reid Dick subsequently transferred to the 3rd Army Field Survey Co, part of the Royal Engineers and then the 7th Field Survey Co. He was in this period allocated regimental numbers 536331 and 244831. He was described as a photographer with the 7th Field Survey Co. His Army Service record shows his profession as \"sculptor\". We can also view his Medal Index Card under reference WO 372/6-52934/2976 [1]. We see that he was awarded the 1915 Star and the British and Victory Medals. Interesting to note that his medals were engraved with the Royal Army Medical Corps shown as his corps rather than the Royal Engineers.\n\nWhilst in the trenches Reid Dick did many small carvings from chalk. A story is told that a padre, touring the trenches, saw Reid Dick at work, and by way of a compliment told Reid Dick that he might well consider taking up carving as a hobby.  As we now know William Dick Reid was to become a foremost sculptors.\n\n==Life after military service==\n\nDick did indeed fulfil the padre's prophecy and produced several superb works. Reid Dick designed several war memorials and received a major commission for the Kitchener Memorial Chapel (1922\u201325) in St Paul's Cathedral, London. The focal point of his design for the chapel was a Pi\u00e8ta, which won a gold medal at the Paris International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925. This work secured his reputation and election to the Royal Academy. Throughout his career, Reid Dick worked tirelessly both in the studio and serving on numerous committees, among these the Royal Fine Art Commission (1928\u201342), the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (1936\u201353), and the Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery (1934\u201341). In addition he was President of the Royal Society of British Sculptors between 1933\u201337.\n\nHis archives are held by the [[Tate Gallery]] and he was buried in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], London.<ref>[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib6_1205923927 Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851\u20131951], University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=dick_wr Glasgow Sculpture]</ref>\n\n==Main works==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Location\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:600px;\"| Comments\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Image\n|-\n|Rickmansworth War Memorial\n|[[Rickmansworth]] [[Hertfordshire]]\n|Part of Rickmansworth's original war memorial is now in the churchyard of St Mary's Church in Church Street and the other part is\nin Three Rivers Council Office Gardens.  Originally what was a cenotaph-type structure was located in Ebury Road but when major changes were made to that road and the junction with the Uxbridge Road to create the Ebury Roundabout, the main structure was moved to St Mary's and the Lion and Eagle which had stood on top of that structure was moved to Three Rivers Council Office Gardens. The memorial in St Mary's churchyard is inscribed {{Quotation|\"IN PROUD AND GRATEFUL MEMORY / OF MEN OF THIS / DISTRICT WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES / IN THE GREAT WAR /1914 / 1918 / ROLL OF HONOUR / (Names) / ROLL OF HONOUR / 1939\u20131945 AND SUBSEQUENT CONFLICTS\" inscription|}}It has a seated woman at both the north and south faces, one symbolising the sorrow and despair of 1914, and the other the hopeful triumph of 1918. It was originally designed to have a pyramid cap on top, but this design was amended to include the statue of a lion with its paws holding down an eagle.

File AIR 1/677/21/13/1891 contains a draft of the Introduction to the Register of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) written by their Director of Records, Major H.F. Chettle. Chettle's covering letter is dated 18 March 1930.  Reid Dick sculpted the globe on top of the Arras Flying Services Memorial which is to be found at the Arras Cemetery in Northern France along with the Arras Memorial. A photograph of this memorial is shown below. Reid Dick carved both the badges on the memorial and the great globe, which is 4-foot 6 inches in diameter and weighs almost three tons. The memorial consists of an obelisk with a globe forming a finial on the top. The badges are those of the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force, Royal Naval Air Service, and the combined badges of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The two memorials and cemetery, the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens, are situated in the western part of Arras. The Arras Memorial commemorates almost 35,000 servicemen from the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand who died in the Arras sector between the spring of 1916 and August 1918, the eve of the so-called \"Advance to Victory\" and who have no known grave. The Arras Flying Services Memorial commemorates nearly 1,000 airmen of the Royal Naval Air Service, the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force either by attachment from other arms of the forces of the Commonwealth or by original enlistment, who were killed on the Western Front and who also have no known grave.<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/82700/ARRAS%20MEMORIAL The Arras Memorial] Commonwealth Graves Commission.

He became an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1921, and a Royal Academician in 1928.  Dick served as president of the [[Royal Society of British Sculptors]] from 1933 to 1938. He was knighted by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in 1935. He was [[Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland]] to King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] from 1938 until his death.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn in [[Glasgow]], Dick was apprenticed to a stonemason at the age of twelve and during the next five years he learned to carve stone at work, and at night took drawing and modelling classes. He completed his apprenticeship in 1896.  In 1907, he graduated from the [[Glasgow School of Art]] and accepted a teaching position at [[Bellshill Academy]] in Lanarkshire. By 1908 he was living in London and exhibiting in galleries and took evening classes at South London Technical School of Art whilst working for the sculptor Edwin Whitney-Smith.\n\n==War service==\n{{Tone|date=May 2016}}\nIn September 1914 with his reputation as a sculptor growing, Reid Dick joined the Territorial Army and from 1915 to 1919 served with the Royal Engineers in both France and Palestine. Reid Dick's Service Record has fortunately been preserved as part of the \"Burnt Records\" series at the National Archives in Kew and can be found under reference WO 363/MIS-SORTS 34/52.   From this file we learn that when Reid Dick signed up on 1 September 1914 he joined the 5th London Field Ambulance section of the Royal Army Medical Corps with regimental number 1752. He was 34 years and 4 months of age and gave his address as 1 St John's Wood Studios, Queens Terrace, St John's Wood. His wife Catherine was shown as \"next of kin\". Reid Dick subsequently transferred to the 3rd Army Field Survey Co, part of the Royal Engineers and then the 7th Field Survey Co. He was in this period allocated regimental numbers 536331 and 244831. He was described as a photographer with the 7th Field Survey Co. His Army Service record shows his profession as \"sculptor\". We can also view his Medal Index Card under reference WO 372/6-52934/2976 [1]. We see that he was awarded the 1915 Star and the British and Victory Medals. Interesting to note that his medals were engraved with the Royal Army Medical Corps shown as his corps rather than the Royal Engineers.\n\nWhilst in the trenches Reid Dick did many small carvings from chalk. A story is told that a padre, touring the trenches, saw Reid Dick at work, and by way of a compliment told Reid Dick that he might well consider taking up carving as a hobby.  As we now know William Dick Reid was to become a foremost sculptors.\n\n==Life after military service==\n\nDick did indeed fulfil the padre's prophecy and produced several superb works. Reid Dick designed several war memorials and received a major commission for the Kitchener Memorial Chapel (1922\u201325) in St Paul's Cathedral, London. The focal point of his design for the chapel was a Pi\u00e8ta, which won a gold medal at the Paris International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925. This work secured his reputation and election to the Royal Academy. Throughout his career, Reid Dick worked tirelessly both in the studio and serving on numerous committees, among these the Royal Fine Art Commission (1928\u201342), the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (1936\u201353), and the Board of Trustees of the Tate Gallery (1934\u201341). In addition he was President of the Royal Society of British Sculptors between 1933\u201337.\n\nHis archives are held by the [[Tate Gallery]] and he was buried in [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], London.<ref>[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib6_1205923927 Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851\u20131951], University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=dick_wr Glasgow Sculpture]</ref>\n\n==Main works==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Location\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:600px;\"| Comments\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Image\n|-\n|Rickmansworth War Memorial\n|[[Rickmansworth]] [[Hertfordshire]]\n|Part of Rickmansworth's original war memorial is now in the churchyard of St Mary's Church in Church Street and the other part is\nin Three Rivers Council Office Gardens.  Originally what was a cenotaph-type structure was located in Ebury Road but when major changes were made to that road and the junction with the Uxbridge Road to create the Ebury Roundabout, the main structure was moved to St Mary's and the Lion and Eagle which had stood on top of that structure was moved to Three Rivers Council Office Gardens. The memorial in St Mary's churchyard is inscribed {{Quotation|\"IN PROUD AND GRATEFUL MEMORY / OF MEN OF THIS / DISTRICT WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES / IN THE GREAT WAR /1914 / 1918 / ROLL OF HONOUR / (Names) / ROLL OF HONOUR / 1939\u20131945 AND SUBSEQUENT CONFLICTS\" inscription|}}It has a seated woman at both the north and south faces, one symbolising the sorrow and despair of 1914, and the other the hopeful triumph of 1918. It was originally designed to have a pyramid cap on top, but this design was amended to include the statue of a lion with its paws holding down an eagle. A pyramid cap was finally substituted in June 1968.  194 names are listed on the cenotaph these of men who were killed in the First World War with a further 82 names of men killed in the Second World War.

Chettle. Chettle's covering letter is dated 18 March 1930.  Reid Dick sculpted the globe on top of the Arras Flying Services Memorial which is to be found at the Arras Cemetery in Northern France along with the Arras Memorial. A photograph of this memorial is shown below. Reid Dick carved both the badges on the memorial and the great globe, which is 4-foot 6 inches in diameter and weighs almost three tons. The memorial consists of an obelisk with a globe forming a finial on the top. The badges are those of the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force, Royal Naval Air Service, and the combined badges of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The two memorials and cemetery, the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens, are situated in the western part of Arras. The Arras Memorial commemorates almost 35,000 servicemen from the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand who died in the Arras sector between the spring of 1916 and August 1918, the eve of the so-called \"Advance to Victory\" and who have no known grave. The Arras Flying Services Memorial commemorates nearly 1,000 airmen of the Royal Naval Air Service, the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force either by attachment from other arms of the forces of the Commonwealth or by original enlistment, who were killed on the Western Front and who also have no known grave.<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/82700/ARRAS%20MEMORIAL The Arras Memorial] Commonwealth Graves Commission.

It serves as the [[capital (political)|administrative center]] of [[Sokal Raion]] (district). Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2017|21,214}}.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sokal 1911 Sokal.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Austrian monarchy stamp cancelled in 1911 in province Galicia]]\nThe first written mention of Sokal dates from 1377.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 1424, it received [[Magdeburg rights]] from [[Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia]], and in 1462, the town became part of [[Belz Voivodeship]], [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]]. On August 2, 1519, following the defeat of a Polish-Lithuanian army under [[Hetman]] [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] by [[Crimean Tatars]], the town was razed by the invaders. [[Mikolaj Sep-Szarzynski]] later dedicated one of his poems to this battle.\n\nThe town remained part of Poland until the [[Partitions of Poland|first partition of Poland]], when it was annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], as part of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. It was the capital of the Sokal district, one of the 78 ''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'' in the [[Austrian Galicia]] province (Crown land) in 1900.<ref>Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den \u00f6sterreichischen  Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967</ref> After [[World War I]], possession of this province was disputed between Poland and [[Soviet Russia]], until the 1921 [[Peace of Riga]], which attributed Eastern Galicia to Poland. In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Sokal was the seat of a county in [[Lwow Voivodeship]].\n\nSokal was in Polish territory until the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. From September 1939 until June 1941 (see [[Operation Barbarossa]]), it was part of Soviet-held territory. Before the [[Holocaust]], Sokal had a Jewish population of 5,200; in addition, thousands of refugees from other parts of Poland arrived in Sokal. On September 17, 1942, 2,000 Jews from Sokal were deported to [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp]]. There was a severe water shortage in the Sokal ghetto. On October 24, 1942, a further 2,500 Jews from the town were deported to the Be\u0142\u017cec gas chambers. On May 27, 1943, the ghetto was liquidated and the town declared '[[Judenfrei|judenrein]]'. Only 30 Jews from the town survived the war, including 15 members of 3 families rescued by the Halamajowa family, consisting of the Polish Catholic grandmother Franciszka, her daughter and son (see [[No.4 Street of Our Lady]]). <ref name= yva/> The Soviet army recaptured the town in July 1944<ref>[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/19306/In_Search_of_a_Shared_Past_in_East/In Search of a Shared Past in East Galicia, With Camera in Hand]</ref>, though the western part of the town (the former village of Zhvirka) remained part of Poland between 1944 and 1951 (see [[1951 Polish\u2013Soviet territorial exchange]]).\n\nIn the early 17th century, a large [[Baroque]] monastery of the [[Franciscan Observants|Bernardine]] monks, together with the Roman Catholic church of the Virgin Mary was built in Sokal. The complex is located in the district of Zhvirka, and until [[World War II]], it housed a painting of Our Lady of Sokal,  which attracted Catholic pilgrims. Jan Ostrorog, one of the first Polish humanists was buried in the town. After World War II, the painting was moved to a church in [[Hrubieszow]], while the monastery was turned into a prison. On March 27, 2012, owing to the negligence of the Ukrainian prison authorities, the historic complex was almost completely destroyed by fire.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[Omelan Pleszkewycz]], the co-founder of the Selfreliance Ukrainian American Credit Union in Chicago, and President of the World Council of Ukrainian Credit Unions, was born near Sokal and graduated from one of its secondary schools.<ref name = \"WCUC\">''Ukrainian Cooperative Movement in Diaspora.': Historical Overview, 1940\u20131992.''

It serves as the [[capital (political)|administrative center]] of [[Sokal Raion]] (district). Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2017|21,214}}.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sokal 1911 Sokal.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Austrian monarchy stamp cancelled in 1911 in province Galicia]]\nThe first written mention of Sokal dates from 1377.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 1424, it received [[Magdeburg rights]] from [[Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia]], and in 1462, the town became part of [[Belz Voivodeship]], [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]]. On August 2, 1519, following the defeat of a Polish-Lithuanian army under [[Hetman]] [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] by [[Crimean Tatars]], the town was razed by the invaders. [[Mikolaj Sep-Szarzynski]] later dedicated one of his poems to this battle.\n\nThe town remained part of Poland until the [[Partitions of Poland|first partition of Poland]], when it was annexed by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], as part of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. It was the capital of the Sokal district, one of the 78 ''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'' in the [[Austrian Galicia]] province (Crown land) in 1900.<ref>Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den \u00f6sterreichischen  Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967</ref> After [[World War I]], possession of this province was disputed between Poland and [[Soviet Russia]], until the 1921 [[Peace of Riga]], which attributed Eastern Galicia to Poland. In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Sokal was the seat of a county in [[Lwow Voivodeship]].\n\nSokal was in Polish territory until the German [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. From September 1939 until June 1941 (see [[Operation Barbarossa]]), it was part of Soviet-held territory. Before the [[Holocaust]], Sokal had a Jewish population of 5,200; in addition, thousands of refugees from other parts of Poland arrived in Sokal. On September 17, 1942, 2,000 Jews from Sokal were deported to [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp]]. There was a severe water shortage in the Sokal ghetto. On October 24, 1942, a further 2,500 Jews from the town were deported to the Be\u0142\u017cec gas chambers. On May 27, 1943, the ghetto was liquidated and the town declared '[[Judenfrei|judenrein]]'. Only 30 Jews from the town survived the war, including 15 members of 3 families rescued by the Halamajowa family, consisting of the Polish Catholic grandmother Franciszka, her daughter and son (see [[No.4 Street of Our Lady]]). <ref name= yva/> The Soviet army recaptured the town in July 1944<ref>[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/19306/In_Search_of_a_Shared_Past_in_East/In Search of a Shared Past in East Galicia, With Camera in Hand]</ref>, though the western part of the town (the former village of Zhvirka) remained part of Poland between 1944 and 1951 (see [[1951 Polish\u2013Soviet territorial exchange]]).\n\nIn the early 17th century, a large [[Baroque]] monastery of the [[Franciscan Observants|Bernardine]] monks, together with the Roman Catholic church of the Virgin Mary was built in Sokal. The complex is located in the district of Zhvirka, and until [[World War II]], it housed a painting of Our Lady of Sokal,  which attracted Catholic pilgrims. Jan Ostrorog, one of the first Polish humanists was buried in the town. After World War II, the painting was moved to a church in [[Hrubieszow]], while the monastery was turned into a prison. On March 27, 2012, owing to the negligence of the Ukrainian prison authorities, the historic complex was almost completely destroyed by fire.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[Omelan Pleszkewycz]], the co-founder of the Selfreliance Ukrainian American Credit Union in Chicago, and President of the World Council of Ukrainian Credit Unions, was born near Sokal and graduated from one of its secondary schools.<ref name = \"WCUC\">''Ukrainian Cooperative Movement in Diaspora.': Historical Overview, 1940\u20131992.''

This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the [[Early Modern Period]].\n\n==Modern development==\nIt was not until the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.\n\nThe practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,<ref name=\"BoiseStateI\">{{cite web |last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I.

The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organisation Society]] in the mid-19th century. The\nsecond was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty.

She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.\n\n[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]\nShe also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.<ref name=\"dnb\">Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 \"Hill, Octavia (1838\u20131912)\",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010</ref> At first Hill believed, \"Voluntary workers are a necessity.

Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.\n\nThe settlement was named after [[Arnold Toynbee]], an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]]. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and [[co-operative]]s. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.\n\nIn America, the settlement movement was established by [[Jane Addams]], a young medical student, and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]] in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.<ref name=\"Danilov pp. 356-357\">{{cite book|author=Victor J.

This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.<ref>Alfred Marshall, \"[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]\", ed.

They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.<ref name=\"BoiseStateIII\"/>\n\nThe movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were \"...a foundation for social work practice in this country\".<ref>Reyes, J. M. (2008).

The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.\n\n===Further Development===\n[[Image:Dublin Slum dwellers 1901 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Poverty in towns, slum dwellers in [[Dublin]], Ireland circa 1901.]]\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}</ref> Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: \"I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations.\"<ref>[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]</ref>\n\nRowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working-class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.<ref>Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.</ref> The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.<ref>Rowntree, B S: \"Poverty: A Study in Town Life\", page 298. Macmillan and CO., 1901</ref>\n\nRowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \"necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.\n\nIn analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle<ref>Searle, G R: \"A New England?\", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.<ref>[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html Joseph Rowntree Foundation Centenary: Poverty<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011147/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html |date=2008-10-12 }}</ref>\n\nThe differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.<ref name=\"Social Work\">{{cite journal | last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra | author2 = Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127\u2013134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url = http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | pmid = 16858918 | doi = 10.1093/sw/51.2.127 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630195743/http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | archive-date = 30 June 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question \"is social work a profession?\" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. [[Abraham Flexner]] spoke on the topic \"Is Social Work a Profession?\" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.<ref name=\"UM-SSW\">{{cite web|title = From Charitable Volunteers to Architects of Social Welfare: A Brief History of Social Work |publisher = [[University of Michigan]] |url =http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html |accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref> This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method.\n\n== Gender perspective in the history of social work ==\nThe importance of the role of women, in particular of feminist organisations, had in the history of social work has been highlighted by several historical studies <ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Social Work in Europe (1900\u20131960)|date=2003|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften|isbn=978-3-8100-3635-3|editor-last=Hering|editor-first=Sabine|location=Wiesbaden|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-80895-0|editor-last2=Waaldijk|editor-first2=Berteke}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Amid social contradictions : towards a history of social work in Europe|date=2009|publisher=Barbara Budrich Publishers|others=Hauss, Gisela, 1956-, Schulte, Dagmar, 1959-|isbn=978-3-86649-150-2|location=Opladen|oclc=231588556}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bortoli, Bruno.|title=I giganti del lavoro sociale : grandi donne (e grandi uomini) nella storia del welfare (1526-1939) Nuova edizione|date=2013|publisher=Erickson|isbn=978-88-590-0165-2|location=Trento|oclc=830362838}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/social-work-history-gender-and-class-profession|title=Social work: A history of gender and class in the profession {{!}} ephemera|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref>Revue suisse de travail social, n\u00b023 (2018).

In one hand there discourse reinforced the dualist vision of social roles, considering care work was appropriate with the characteristic women were supposed to have (e.g. softness, empathy, solicitude, love, abnegation, etc.). On the other hand, they affirmed a will to change women's place in society by giving them more power and better recognition. Conversely, when feminists are absent, this has an impact on the professionalisation process, relegating women in the margins. This appears particularly in a study on professionalisation of socio-cultural community work from the 1960s in Switzerland <ref>Togni, C. & Malatesta, D. (2019). Feminism and the professionalisation of social work : a socio-historical approach through two Swiss examples (1910-1970). ''Contemporanea, 22''(2), 282-287.</ref>.  This study shows that men were hired as socio-cultural community workers to develop youth activities, especially with teenage boys, while status of women were less prestigious (assistant, social carers or child care workers) and the child care work they were attributed to viewed as not (or less) relevant for the \u00ab ''socio-cultural'' community work project \u00bb of the centres <ref>Dallera, C., Malatesta, D. & Togni, C.

The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered \"deserving enough\" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.<ref name=gehlert/>\n\nThe first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.\n\nThis approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.<ref name=gehlert/>  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.\n\n==State Welfare==\n[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]\nAs the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.<ref name='eatwell'>{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}</ref> A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences.

This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.\n\nThis is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, M. (2011).

Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty.

She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.\n\n[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]\nShe also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.<ref name=\"dnb\">Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 \"Hill, Octavia (1838\u20131912)\",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010</ref> At first Hill believed, \"Voluntary workers are a necessity.

Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.\n\nThe settlement was named after [[Arnold Toynbee]], an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]]. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and [[co-operative]]s. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population.

This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.<ref>Alfred Marshall, \"[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]\", ed.

They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.<ref name=\"BoiseStateIII\"/>\n\nThe movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were \"...a foundation for social work practice in this country\".<ref>Reyes, J. M. (2008).

The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.\n\n===Further Development===\n[[Image:Dublin Slum dwellers 1901 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Poverty in towns, slum dwellers in [[Dublin]], Ireland circa 1901.]]\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}</ref> Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: \"I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations.\"<ref>[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]</ref>\n\nRowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.<ref>Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.</ref> The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.<ref>Rowntree, B S: \"Poverty: A Study in Town Life\", page 298. Macmillan and CO., 1901</ref>\n\nRowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \"necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.\n\nIn analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle<ref>Searle, G R: \"A New England?\", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives.

In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.<ref name=\"Social Work\">{{cite journal | last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra | author2 = Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127\u2013134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url = http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | accessdate = 2008-02-19 | pmid = 16858918 | doi = 10.1093/sw/51.2.127 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630195743/http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127 | archive-date = 30 June 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question \"is social work a profession?\" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. [[Abraham Flexner]] spoke on the topic \"Is Social Work a Profession?\" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.<ref name=\"UM-SSW\">{{cite web|title = From Charitable Volunteers to Architects of Social Welfare: A Brief History of Social Work |publisher = [[University of Michigan]] |url =http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html |accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}</ref> This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method.\n\n== Gender perspective in the history of social work ==\nThe importance of the role of women, in particular of feminist organisations, had in the history of social work has been highlighted by several historical studies <ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Social Work in Europe (1900\u20131960)|date=2003|publisher=VS Verlag f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften|isbn=978-3-8100-3635-3|editor-last=Hering|editor-first=Sabine|location=Wiesbaden|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-322-80895-0|editor-last2=Waaldijk|editor-first2=Berteke}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Amid social contradictions : towards a history of social work in Europe|date=2009|publisher=Barbara Budrich Publishers|others=Hauss, Gisela, 1956-, Schulte, Dagmar, 1959-|isbn=978-3-86649-150-2|location=Opladen|oclc=231588556}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bortoli, Bruno.|title=I giganti del lavoro sociale : grandi donne (e grandi uomini) nella storia del welfare (1526-1939) Nuova edizione|date=2013|publisher=Erickson|isbn=978-88-590-0165-2|location=Trento|oclc=830362838}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/social-work-history-gender-and-class-profession|title=Social work: A history of gender and class in the profession {{!}} ephemera|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref><ref>Revue suisse de travail social, n\u00b023 (2018).

In one hand there discourse reinforced the dualist vision of social roles, considering care work was appropriate with the characteristic women were supposed to have (e.g. softness, empathy, solicitude, love, abnegation, etc.). On the other hand, they affirmed a will to change women\u2019s place in society by giving them more power and better recognition. Conversely, when feminists are absent, this has an impact on the professionalisation process, relagating women in the margins. This appears particularly in a study on professionalisation of socio-cultural community work from the 1960s in Switzerland <ref>Togni, C. & Malatesta, D. (2019). Feminism and the professionalisation of social work : a socio-historical approach through two Swiss examples (1910-1970). ''Contemporanea, 22''(2), 282-287.</ref>.  This study shows that men were hired as socio-cultural community workers to develop youth activities, especially with teenage boys, while status of women were less prestigious (assistant, social carers or child care workers) and the child care work they were attributed to viewed as not (or less) relevant for the \u00ab ''socio-cultural'' community work project \u00bb of the centres <ref>Dallera, C., Malatesta, D. & Togni, C.

''Revue suisse de travail social, 23,'' 11-27.</ref>. \n\n==Medical Social Work==\n[[File:Jane Addams profile.jpg|150px|thumbnail|100px|[[Jane Addams]] (1860\u20131935) was a founder of the [[Settlement movement|U.S. Settlement House movement]] and is considered one of the early influences on professional social work in the United States.]]\nThe first professional [[medical social work]]ers in England were called hospital almoners, and were based in medical institutions. The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered \"deserving enough\" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.<ref name=gehlert/>\n\nThe first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.\n\nThis approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.<ref name=gehlert/>  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.\n\n==State Welfare==\n[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]\nAs the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.<ref name='eatwell'>{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}</ref> A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.<ref>Nicholson, P. P., \u201cT. H.

In the early 1900s, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]] introduced various [[Liberal reforms|reforms]], including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]].<ref>Heywood, p. 61.</ref>\n\n[[William Beveridge]], often called the 'architect of the welfare state', was pivotal in framing the debate about social work in the context of state welfare provision. His 1942 report on ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'',<ref name=\"Original report title page\">{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=William|title=Social Insurance and Allied Services|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|website=British Library|publisher=BL|accessdate=8 July 2014|ref=Original report title page|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233116/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> known commonly as the ''[[Beveridge Report]]'', identified five \"Giant Evils\" in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease, and went on to propose widespread reform to the system of social welfare to mitigate these problems.<ref>Brian Abel\u2010Smith, \"The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes.\" ''International Social Security Review'' (1992) 45#1\u20102 pp 5-16.</ref> The report proved very popular with a war-weary public, and went on to form the basis to the post-war expansion of the Welfare State and the creation of the [[National Health Service]], a free at the point of delivery healthcare provider.\n\n==Today==\nCurrently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.\n\nThis is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].<ref name=\"Payne\">Payne, M. (2011).

The new [[Territories of the United States|territories]] acquired via the [[Louisiana purchase]] and the [[Mexican cession]] were the subject of major political crises and compromises. By 1850, the newly-rich, cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and tensions continued to rise. Slavery was defended in the South as a \"positive good\", and large Protestant denominations split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South. \n\nWhen [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, seven states broke away to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Shortly afterward, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began when Confederate forces attacked the US Army's [[Fort Sumter]]. Four additional slave states then seceded after Lincoln requested arms from them to make a retaliatory strike. Due to Union measures such as the [[Confiscation Acts]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, the war effectively ended slavery even before the institution was banned by constitutional amendment. Following the Union victory in the Civil War, slavery was made illegal in the United States upon the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December 1865. Slavery briefly returned within US territory from 1901-1946 when the US federal government allowed the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in the [[Philippines]] (a US possession during the first half of the twentieth century) to continue to practice slavery.

As English custom then considered baptized Christians exempt from slavery, colonists treated these Africans as indentured servants, and they joined about 1,000 English indentured servants already in the colony. The Africans were freed after a prescribed period and given the use of land and supplies by their former masters. The historian [[Ira Berlin]] noted that what he called the \"charter generation\" in the colonies was sometimes made up of mixed-race men (Atlantic Creoles) who were indentured servants, and whose ancestry was African and Iberian. They were descendants of African women and Portuguese or Spanish men who worked in African ports as traders or facilitators in the trade of enslaved people. For example, [[Anthony Johnson (colonist)|Anthony Johnson]] arrived in Virginia in 1621 from Angola as an indentured servant; he became free and a property owner, eventually buying and enslaving people himself. The transformation of the social status of Africans, from indentured servitude to slaves in a racial caste which they could not leave or escape, happened gradually.\n\nThere were no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia's history.

England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies. Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth, they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside [[English common law]]. The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects. In 1656 Virginia, [[Elizabeth Key Grinstead]], a [[mixed-race]] woman, successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. Her attorney was an English subject, which may have helped her case. (He was also the father of her mixed-race son, and the couple married after Key was freed.)<ref name=\"Banks\">[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, \"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit \u2013 Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia\"], Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School.

A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of [[common law]] practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between those who enslaved people and enslaved women, freed white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their [[mixed-race]] children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and [[miscegenation]] to within the slave quarters.\n\nIn 1672, King Charles II rechartered the [[Royal African Company]] (it had initially been set up in 1660), as an English monopoly for the African slave and commodities trade\u2014thereafter in 1698, by statute, the English parliament opened the trade to all English subjects.<ref name=\"pbs.org1\">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html</ref>  The trade of enslaved people to the mid-Atlantic colonies increased substantially in the 1680s, and by 1710 the African population in Virginia had increased to 23,100 (42% of total); Maryland contained 8,000 Africans (14.5% of total).<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 88.</ref>  In the early 18th century, England passed Spain and Portugal to become the world's leading trader of enslaved people.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/index.aspx|title=European traders|last=|first=|date=|website=International Slavery Museum|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> From the early 18th century American merchants, especially in [[Charleston, S.C.]], challenged the monopoly of the Royal African Company, and [[Joseph Wragg]] and Benjamin Savage became the first independent traders of enslaved people to break through the monopoly by the 1730s.<ref>Pamela Chase Hain, A Confederate Chronicle: The Life of a Civil War Survivor, p. 2, 2005</ref>\n\nThe Virginia [[Slave codes]] of 1705 further defined as slaves those people imported from nations that were not [[Christians|Christian]].

[T]he {{bracket|[[Somerset v Stewart|Somerset]]}} ruling caused a sensation.... Numerous colonial newspapers covered it and warned of the tyranny it represented. Multiple historians have pointed out that in part because of the Somerset case, slavery joined other issues in helping to gradually drive apart the patriots and their colonial governments. ...[L]arge numbers of the enslaved came to see the struggle as one between freedom [under the British] and continued subjugation. As Waldstreicher writes, \u201cThe black-British alliance decisively pushed planters in these [Southern] states toward independence.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of this was the [[Dunmore Proclamation]]....

She said subsequent materials based on the series would later be better contextualized.<ref name=Serwer/>\n\n===Constitution of the United States===\nSlavery was a contentious issue in the writing and approval of the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref>Keith L.

As the historian James Oliver Horton noted, prominent slaveholder politicians and the commodity crops of the South had a strong influence on United States politics and economy. Horton said,\n\n<blockquote>in the 72 years between the election of George Washington and the election of Abraham Lincoln, 50 of those years [had] a slaveholder as president of the United States, and, for that whole period of time, there was never a person elected to a second term who was not a slaveholder.<ref name=\"pbs.org\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe power of Southern states in Congress lasted until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], affecting national policies, legislation, and appointments.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html \"Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City\"], PBS ''Newshour'', January 25, 2007.

He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white Southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the South, were bringing the white and black populations to a state of equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.<ref name=\"Alexis de Tocqueville\">{{cite book|title=Democracy in America (Volume 1)|last=de Tocqueville |first=Alexise|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States|isbn=978-1-4209-2910-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert E.

Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor management. [[John C. Calhoun]], in a famous speech in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1837, declared that slavery was \"instead of an evil, a good\u2014a positive good\". Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this respect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in wealth and numbers\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Charles A. |authorlink1=Charles A.

In a speech to the Senate on March 4, 1858, Hammond developed his \"Mudsill Theory,\" defending his view on slavery stating: \"Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill.\" Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/> He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: \"The difference\u2026 is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment,\" while those in the North had to search for employment.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/>\n\nGeorge Fitzhugh used assumptions about white superiority to justify slavery, writing that, \"the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child.\" In ''The Universal Law of Slavery'', Fitzhugh argues that slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy, and cannot compete with the intelligent European white race. He states that \"The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the freest people in the world.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\">{{cite web|last=Fitzhugh|first=George|authorlink=George Fitzhugh|title=The Universal Law of Slavery|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3141t.html|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Without the South, \"He (slave) would become an insufferable burden to society\" and \"Society has the right to prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\"/>\n\nOn March 21, 1861, [[Alexander Stephens]], Vice President of the Confederacy, delivered his [[Cornerstone Speech]].

What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.

It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away...

By 1810, the number and proportion of free blacks in the population of the United States had risen dramatically. Most free blacks lived in the North, but even in the [[Upper South]], the proportion of free blacks went from less than one percent of all blacks to more than 10 percent, even as the total number of slaves was increasing through imports.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993 pp. 77-78\">Peter Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', pp. 77\u201378, 81.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, passed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]], slavery was prohibited in the territories northwest of the [[Ohio River]]; existing slaves were not freed for years, although they could no longer be sold. This was a compromise. [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed in 1784 to end slavery in all the territories, but his bill lost in the [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] by one vote.

What developed was a Northern block of free states united into one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti-slavery culture. The exceptions were the areas along the Ohio River settled by Southerners: the southern portions of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. Residents of those areas generally shared in Southern culture and attitudes. In addition, these areas were devoted to agriculture longer than the industrializing northern parts of these states, and some farmers used slave labor. In Illinois, for example, while the trade in slaves was prohibited, it was legal to bring slaves from Kentucky into Illinois and use them there, as long as the slaves left Illinois one day per year (they were \"visiting\"). The emancipation of slaves in the North led to the growth in the population of Northern free blacks, from several hundred in the 1770s to nearly 50,000 by 1810.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 104.</ref>\n\n==Agitation against slavery==\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\n[[File:Benjamin Kent, Old Burying Ground, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Kent]], [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)|Old Burying Ground]], Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n\nThere was legal agitation against slavery in the 13 colonies starting in 1752 by lawyer [[Benjamin Kent]], whose cases were recorded by one of his understudies, the future president [[John Adams]].

They worked to raise awareness about the evils of slavery, and to build support for abolition.\n\nThis struggle took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners, who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. But slavery was entwined with the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping, and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery, as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North. The northern textile mills in New York and New England processed Southern cotton and manufactured clothes to outfit slaves. By 1822 half of New York City's exports were related to cotton.<ref name=\"divided\">[http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/G1/G1ReadMore.php \"King Cotton: Dramatic Growth of the Cotton Trade\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330070752/http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/G1/G1ReadMore.php |date=March 30, 2013 }}, ''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War'', New-York Historical Society, accessed May 12, 2012</ref>\n\nSlaveholders began to refer to slavery as the \"[[peculiar institution]]\" to differentiate it from other examples of [[forced labor]].

Cuffe believed that African Americans could more easily \"rise to be a people\" in Africa than in the U.S. because of the latter's slavery, racial discrimination, and limits on black rights. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts encouraged the ACS to promote further settlements. The [[Quakers]] opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. Slaveholders opposed abolition, but wanted to get rid off [[freedmen]], which they saw as potential leaders of rebellions and people who encouraged slaves to run away.</ref> The ACS was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders, who found uneasy common ground in support of what was incorrectly called \"repatriation\". But by this time most black Americans were native-born and did not want to emigrate, saying they were no more African than the Americans were British. Rather, they wanted full rights in the United States, where their families had lived and worked for generations.\n\nIn 1822 the ACS and affiliated state societies established what would become the colony of [[Liberia]], in West Africa.<ref name=\"WDLMap\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/446/ |title = Map of Liberia, West Africa |work = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1830 |accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref> The ACS assisted thousands of freedmen and free blacks (with legislated limits) to emigrate there from the United States. Many white people considered this preferable to [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] in the United States. [[Henry Clay]], one of the founders and a prominent slaveholder politician from Kentucky, said that blacks faced\n\n<blockquote>unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country.

After 1830, abolitionist and newspaper publisher [[William Lloyd Garrison]] promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as a personal sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness on the part of some Southerners, who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he attempted to do at [[Harper's Ferry]]. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. The eloquent [[Frederick Douglass]] became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous [[anti-Tom novels]] by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.\n\n===Prohibiting the international trade===\nWhile under the Constitution, Congress could not prohibit the import slave trade until 1808, the third Congress regulated it in the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which prohibited shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade. Subsequent acts [[Slave Trade Act of 1800|in 1800]] and 1803 sought to discourage the trade by limiting investment in import trading and prohibiting importation into states that had abolished slavery, which most in the North had by that time.<ref name=\"Regulation of the Trade\">{{cite web | url=http://abolition.nypl.org/essays/us_constitution/4/ | title=Regulation of the Trade | publisher=[[New York Public Library]] | accessdate=June 23, 2014}}</ref> The final [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] was adopted in 1807, effective in 1808.

From 1819, they were assisted by forces from the United States Navy. With the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842, the relationship with Britain was formalized, and the two countries jointly ran the [[Blockade of Africa]] with their navies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|title=Potomac Books \u2013 University of Nebraska Press \u2013 University of Nebraska Press|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015130620/http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|archivedate=October 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Post-revolution Southern manumissions===\nAlthough Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware were slave states, the latter two already had a high proportion of free blacks by the outbreak of war. Following the Revolution, the three legislatures made [[manumission]] easier, allowed by deed or will. Quaker and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than 1% in 1792 to more than 10% by 1810.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993 pp. 77-78\" /> In Delaware, nearly 75% of blacks were free by 1810.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 78.</ref>\n\nIn the US as a whole, by 1810 the number of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5% of all blacks.<ref name=\"PeterKolchin\">Peter Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 81.</ref> After that period few slaves were freed, as the development of [[Plantations in the American South|cotton plantations]] featuring short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices were paid.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 87.</ref>\n\nSouth Carolina made manumission more difficult, requiring legislative approval of every instance of manumission. Several Southern states required manumitted slaves to leave the state within 30 days.\n\n===Domestic slave trade and forced migration===\n[[File:Slavery map.jpg|thumb|right|Movement of slaves between 1790 and 1860]]\n\nThe growing international demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west in search of suitable land. In addition, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] in 1793 enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the [[War of 1812]], fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the [[Deep South]] and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it.<ref>''The People's Chronology'', 1994, by James Trager.</ref> As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.<ref>Kolchin p. 96.\n\nThrough the domestic slave trade, about one million enslaved African Americans were forcibly removed from the Upper South to the Deep South, with some transported by ship in the coastwise trade. In 1834, [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]] grew half the nation's cotton; by 1859, along with [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], they grew 78%. By 1859 cotton growth in the [[Carolinas]] had fallen to just 10% of the national total.

These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship. Characterizing it as the \"central event\" in the life of a slave between the [[American Revolution]] and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, \"the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 161\u201362.</ref> Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families who had been in the United States for many generations.<ref name=\"CUP\" />\n\nIn the 1840s, almost 300,000 slaves were transported, with Alabama and Mississippi receiving 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Michael Tadman wrote in ''Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South'' (1989) that 60\u201370% of inter-regional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance of being sold south by 1860.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201369. Kolchin p. 96. Kolchin notes that Fogel and Engerman maintained that 84% of slaves moved with their families but \"most other scholars assign far greater weight \u2026 to slave sales.\" Ransome (p. 582) notes that Fogel and Engermann based their conclusions on the study of some counties in Maryland in the 1830s and attempted to extrapolate that analysis as reflective of the entire South over the entire period.</ref> The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, but mortality was higher than the normal death rate.\n[[File:Slave Market-Atlanta Georgia 1864.jpg|Slave trader's business in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1864|thumb]]\n[[Interregional slave trade|Slave traders]] transported two-thirds of the slaves who moved west.<ref>{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Kulikoff |title=The Agrarian Origins of American Capitalism |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8139-1388-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli/page/226 226]\u201369 |url=https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli |url-access=registration }}</ref> Only a minority moved with their families and existing master. Slave traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave families; in the early years, planters demanded only the young male slaves needed for heavy labor. Later, in the interest of creating a \"self-reproducing labor force\", planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women. Berlin wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The slave trade industry developed its own unique language, with terms such as \"prime hands, bucks, breeding wenches, and \"fancy girls\" coming into common use.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 166\u201369.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the \"economic revival of once depressed seaboard states\" as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale.<ref>Kolchin, p. 98.</ref>\n\nSome traders moved their \"chattels\" by sea, with [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] on the Ohio River, and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi. Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards, and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition, other vendors provided clothes, food, and supplies for slaves. As the trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin concluded, \"In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201371.</ref>\n\nOnce the trip ended, slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly different from most labor in the Upper South. Clearing trees and starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work. A combination of inadequate nutrition, bad water, and exhaustion from both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and produced casualties. New plantations were located at rivers' edges for ease of transportation and travel. [[Mosquito]]es and other environmental challenges spread disease, which took the lives of many slaves. They had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their previous homes. The death rate was so high that, in the first few years of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness, some planters preferred whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led owners and overseers to rely on violence for control. Many of the slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the \"sunrise-to-sunset gang labor\" required by their new life. Slaves were driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or [[wheat]] back east. Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality of their lives by raising their own [[livestock]] or tending vegetable gardens, for either their own consumption or trade, as they could in the east.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 175\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]], French colonists had established [[sugar cane]] plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop. After the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, Americans entered the state and joined the sugar cultivation. Between 1810 and 1830, planters bought slaves from the North and the number of slaves increased from less than 10,000 to more than 42,000. Planters preferred young males, who represented two-thirds of the slave purchases. Dealing with sugar cane was even more physically demanding than growing cotton. The largely young, unmarried male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners \"especially savage\".<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref>\n\n[[New Orleans]] became nationally important as a slave market and port, as slaves were shipped from there upriver by [[steamboat]] to plantations on the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, it had the largest slave market in North America. It became the wealthiest and the fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999.</ref> The trading season was from September to May, after the harvest.<ref>Johnson (1999), ''Soul by Soul'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nSlave traders were men of low reputation, even in the South.

The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave.<ref>Moore, p. 114.</ref> Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.\n\n[[William Wells Brown]], who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed in his or her quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short.

It was generally provided by other slaves or by slaveholders' family members, although sometimes \"plantation physicians\", like [[J.

This prohibition was unique to American slavery, believed to reduce slaves forming aspirations that could lead to escape or rebellion.<ref>Rodriguez, pp 616\u201317.</ref> Informal education occurred when white children taught slave companions what they were learning; in other cases, adult slaves learned from free artisan workers, especially if located in cities, where there was more freedom of movement.\n\nIn Alabama, slaves were not allowed to leave their master's premises without written consent or passes. This was a common requirement in other states as well, and locally run patrols (known to slaves as ''pater rollers'') often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations. In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves. In Virginia, a slave was not permitted to drink in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings. Slaves were not permitted to carry firearms in any of the slave states.\n\nSlaves were generally prohibited by law from associating in groups, with the exception of worship services (a reason why the [[Black church]] is such a notable institution in black communities today). Following [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion in 1831, which raised white fears throughout the South, some states also prohibited or restricted religious gatherings of slaves, or required that they be officiated by white men. Planters feared that group meetings would facilitate communication among slaves that could lead to rebellion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas D. |last=Morris |year=1999 |title=Southern Slavery and the Law, 1619\u20131860 |location= |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=347 |isbn=978-0-8078-6430-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmPWCKh0hZAC&pg=PA347 }}</ref> Slaves held private, secret \"brush meetings\" in the woods.\n\nIn Ohio, an emancipated slave was prohibited from returning to the state in which he or she had been enslaved.

By contrast, the states of Georgia and South Carolina reopened their trade due to demand by their upland planters, who were developing new cotton plantations: Georgia from 1800 until December 31, 1807, and South Carolina from 1804. In that period, Charleston traders imported about 75,000 slaves, more than were brought to South Carolina in the 75 years before the Revolution.<ref>James A.

The domestic slave trade became extremely profitable as demand rose with the expansion of cultivation in the Deep South for cotton and sugar cane crops. Slavery in the United States became, more or less, self-sustaining by natural increase among the current slaves and their descendants.\n\nDespite the ban, slave imports continued through smugglers bringing in slaves past the U.S. Navy's [[African Slave Trade Patrol]] to South Carolina, and overland from Texas and Florida, both under Spanish control.<ref>{{cite book |first=Hugh |last=Thomas |title=The Slave Trade.

Fogel's 1989 work, ''Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery'', elaborated on the moral indictment of slavery which ultimately led to its abolition.\n\n===Efficiency of slaves===\n[[File:RebeccaAugustRosaSlaveChildren.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Mixed-race slave girls of predominant European ancestry, New Orleans, 1863. (See also [[white slave propaganda]]).]]\nScholars disagree on how to quantify efficiency of slavery. In ''Time on the Cross'', Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to [[total factor productivity]] (TFP)\u2014the output per average unit of input on a farm. Using this measurement, Southern farms that enslaved black people using the [[gang system]] were 35% more efficient than Northern farms which used free labor. Under the gang system, groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each group was like a part of a machine. If perceived to be working below his capacity, a slave could be punished. Fogel argues that this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent and that slaves and free laborers had similar quality of life; however, there is controversy on this last point.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\">{{cite book|last=Fogel & Engerman|title=Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery|year=1974|publisher=W.W.

Economies of scale, effective management, and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming.\" 48 percent of the economists agreed without provisos, while 24 percent agreed when provisos were included in the statement. On the other hand, 58 percent of economic historians and 42 percent of economists disagreed with Fogel and Engerman's \"proposition that the material (not psychological) conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the decades before the Civil War\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=141, 146\u2013147|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield high profits. Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened, the slave prices would have increased even more, an average of more than 50 percent by 1890.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />{{rp|96}}\n[[File:Slavery19.jpg|thumb|left|A slave auction, 1853]]\nPrices reflected the characteristics of the slave\u2014such factors as sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher than their male counterparts up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children and produce more slaves, in addition to serving as laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars\u2014a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master's brutality, and would lower the slave's price.<ref name=\"McInnis2011\" /> Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />\n\nThe conditions of the market led to shocks in the supply and demand of slaves, which in turn changed prices. For example, slaves became more expensive after 1808, when no more could be imported. The market for the products of their work also affected slaves' economic value: demand for slaves fell with the price of cotton in 1840. Anticipation of changes also had a huge influence on prices. As the Civil War progressed, there was great doubt that slavery would continue to be legal, and prime males in New Orleans were sold at $1,116 by 1862 as opposed to $1,381 in 1861.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kotlikoff|first=L.

She is also drawing attention to black women's labor being needed to maintain the aristocracy of a white ruling class, due to the intimate nature of reproduction and its potential for producing more enslaved peoples.\n\nDue to the institution of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', black women's wombs became the site where slavery was developed and transferred,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108 108]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108}}</ref> meaning that black women were not only used for their physical labor, but for their sexual and reproductive labor as well.\n\n<blockquote>\"The rule that the children\u2019s status follows their mothers\u2019 was a foundational one for our economy.

This ungendering black women received under slavery contributed to the systemic dehumanization experienced by enslaved black women, as they were unable to receive the expectations or experiences of either gender within the white binary.\n\nDavis\u2019 arguments addresses the fact that under slavery, black women's sexuality became linked to the economic and public sphere, making their intimate lives into public institutions. Black women's physical labor was gendered as masculine under slavery when they were needed to yield more profit, but their reproductive capacities and sexual labor was equally as important in maintaining white power over black communities and perpetuating an enslaved workforce.<ref name=\":02\" /> This blurring of the line between the private and public sphere is another way Davis articulates how black women's sexuality and reproduction was commodified and exploited for capitalist gain, as their private and intimate lives became disrupted by the violence at the hands of white men, and their sexual capacities became an important part of the public marketplace and United States economy.\n\n==1850s==\n\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eastman Johnson]] (American, 1824\u20131906).

[[Daguerreotype]] of elderly [[North Carolina]] [[slave]], circa 1850.]]\nIn 1850, Congress passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which required law enforcement and citizens of free states to cooperate in the capture and return of slaves. This met with considerable overt and covert resistance in free states and cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Refugees from slavery continued to flee the South across the [[Ohio River]] and other parts of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]] dividing North from South, to the North and Canada via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Some white northerners helped hide former slaves from their former owners or helped them reach freedom in Canada.<ref>Larry Gara, '' The Liberty Line: The Legend of the Underground Railroad'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2013).</ref>\n\nAs part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], Congress abolished the slave trade (though not the ownership of slaves) in the [[District of Columbia]]; fearing this would happen, [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], regional slave trading center and port, successfully sought [[District of Columbia retrocession|its removal from the District of Columbia and devolution to Virginia]].  After 1854, [[History of the United States  Republican Party|Republicans]] argued that the \"[[Slave Power]]\", especially the pro-slavery [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party in the South]], controlled two of the three branches of the Federal government.<ref>Leonard L.  Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780\u20141860'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe abolitionists, realizing that the total elimination of slavery was as an immediate goal unrealistic, worked to prevent expansion of slavery into the western territories which eventually would be new states. The [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], and the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis dealt with whether new states would be slave or free, or how that was to be decided. Both sides were anxious about effects of these decisions on the balance of power in the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]].\n\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\nAfter the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, border fighting broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a [[slave state|slave]] or [[free state (USA)|free state]] was [[Popular Sovereignty|left to the inhabitants]]. Migrants from free and slave states moved into the territory to prepare for the vote on slavery. Abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the fighting in \"Bleeding Kansas,\" but so too were many white Southerners who opposed abolition.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's and the Republicans' political platform in 1860 was to stop slavery's expansion. Historian James McPherson says that in a famous speech in 1858, Lincoln said American republicanism can be purified by restricting the further expansion of slavery as the first step to putting it on the road to 'ultimate extinction.' Southerners took Lincoln at his word. When he won the presidency they left the Union to escape the 'ultimate extinction' of slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James M.

Sandford|Freedom suits}}\nWith the development of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states. Most free states not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases.<ref>Paul Finkelman, '' Dred Scott v. Sandford: a brief history with documents'' (Bedford Books, 1997). </ref>  [[Dred Scott]] and his wife Harriet Scott each [[freedom suit|sued for freedom]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after the death of their master, based on their having been held in a free territory (the northern part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from which slavery was excluded under the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]]). (Later the two cases were combined under Dred Scott's name.) Scott filed suit for freedom in 1846 and went through two state trials, the first denying and the second granting freedom to the couple (and, by extension, their two daughters, who had also been held illegally in free territories). For 28 years, Missouri state precedent had generally respected laws of neighboring free states and territories, ruling for freedom in such transit cases where slaves had been held illegally in free territory. But in the Dred Scott case, the State Supreme Court ruled against the slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Don E. |last=Fehrenbacher |authorlink=Don E.

Taney]], in a sweeping decision, denied Scott his freedom. The 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|decision]], decided 7\u20132, held that a slave did not become free when taken into a free state; Congress could not bar slavery from a territory; and people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves, or their descendants, could never be citizens and thus had no status to bring suit in a U.S. court. A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state. Many Republicans, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], considered the decision unjust and evidence that the [[Slave Power]] had seized control of the Supreme Court. Anti-slavery groups were enraged and slave owners encouraged, escalating the tensions that led to civil war.<ref>Fehrenbacher, ''The Dred Scott case: Its significance in American law and politics'' (2001).</ref>\n\n==Civil War and emancipation==\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n\n===1860 presidential election===\n\nThe divisions became fully exposed with the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis: America Before the Civil War, 1848\u20131861'' (Harper & Row\n, 1976).</ref>\n\nLincoln, the Republican, won with a plurality of popular votes and a majority of [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states. Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be disastrous for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who were not paid. The slave owners feared that ending the balance could lead to the domination of the federal government by the northern free states. This led seven southern states to [[Ordinance of Secession|secede from the Union]]. When the southern forces attacked a US Army installation at Fort Sumter, the [[American Civil War]] began and four additional slave states seceded. Northern leaders had viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically, but with secession, they viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], with control over the [[Mississippi River]] and parts of the [[Western United States|West]], as politically unacceptable.  Most of all they could not accept this repudiation of American nationalism.<ref>Potter, pp 448\u2013554. </ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe consequent [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of chattel slavery in America. Not long after the war broke out, through a legal maneuver credited to Union General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]], a lawyer by profession, slaves who came into Union \"possession\" were considered [[contraband (American Civil War)|\"contraband of war\"]]. General Butler ruled that they were not subject to return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war. Soon word spread, and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory, desiring to be declared \"contraband\". Many of the \"contrabands\" joined the [[Union Army]] as workers or troops, forming entire regiments of the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]. Others went to refugee camps such as the [[Grand Contraband Camp]] near [[Fort Monroe]] or fled to northern cities. General Butler's interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which declared that any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces.\n\n[[File:Timothy H. O'Sullivan (American - Slaves, J. J. Smith's Plantation, South Carolina - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan|Timothy O'Sullivan]] standing before their quarters in 1862]]\nAt the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As Congressman [[George Washington Julian|George W. Julian]] of Indiana put it in an 1862 speech in Congress, the slaves \"cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.\"<ref>[[James M. McPherson|McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', p. 495.</ref> Julian and his fellow Radical Republicans put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.<ref>McPherson, ''Battle Cry'', pp. 355, 494\u20136, quote from [[George Washington Julian|George Julian]] on 495.</ref> [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], the [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] and [[War Democrats]] opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of [[total war]] needed to save the Union.\n\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Leon F. |last=Litwack |authorlink=Leon Litwack |title=Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-394-50099-7 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bi2aAAAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states. He believed that \"to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.\"<ref>Lincoln's letter to O. H. Browning, September 22, 1861.</ref> At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C.

Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like \"our last shriek on the retreat\".<ref>[[Stephen B. Oates]], ''Abraham Lincoln: The Man Behind the Myths'', page 106.</ref> In September 1862 the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.<ref>''Images of America: Altoona'', by Sr. Anne Francis Pulling, 2001, 10.</ref> Lincoln had already published a letter<ref>Letter to Greeley, August 22, 1862.</ref> encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was \"somehow the cause of the war\".<ref name=\"Second Inaugural\">Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865.</ref>\n\nLincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and said that a final proclamation would be issued if his gradual plan, based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization, was rejected.<!-- by whom? Negotiations with the South?--> Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that\n\n{{quote|If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong \u2026 And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling \u2026 I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.<ref>Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.</ref>}}\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a powerful action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy as soon as the Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states that bordered the Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]], at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total population of the United States.\n\nBased on the President's war powers, the Emancipation Proclamation applied to territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.<ref>James McPherson, ''The War that Never Goes Away''.</ref> Lincoln played a leading role in getting the constitutionally-required two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment,<ref name=\"Who Freed\">James McPherson, \"Drawn With the Sword\", from the article \"Who Freed the Slaves?\"</ref> which made emancipation universal and permanent.\n[[File:Family of African American slaves on Smith's Plantation Beaufort South Carolina.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Four [[generation]]s of a [[slave]] family, Smith's Plantation, [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], 1862]]\nEnslaved African Americans had not waited for Lincoln before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in Union-controlled areas such as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and the [[Hampton Roads]] region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The [[American Missionary Association]] entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.\n\nIn addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served with distinction in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors. Most were escaped slaves. The Confederacy was outraged by armed black soldiers and refused to treat them as [[prisoners of war]]. They murdered many, as at the [[Fort Pillow Massacre]], and re-enslaved others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle |first=Robert C.

[[Tennessee]] and all of the border states (except [[Kentucky]]) abolished slavery by early 1865. Thousands of slaves were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union armies marched across the South. Emancipation came to the remaining southern slaves after the surrender of all Confederate troops in spring 1865.\n\nIn spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates discussed arming slaves. Finally in early 1865 General Robert E. Lee said black soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed.

Blackmon]] reported in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[Slavery By Another Name]]'' that many blacks were virtually enslaved under [[convict leasing]] programs, which started after the Civil War. Most Southern states had no prisons; they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor, and the lessee paid for food and board. The incentives for abuse were satisfied.\n\nThe continued involuntary servitude took various forms, but the primary forms included [[Convict lease|convict leasing]], [[peon]]age, and [[sharecropping]], with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well. By the 1930s, whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South. Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor, and many blacks left the South in the Great Migration. Jurisdictions and states created fines and sentences for a wide variety of minor crimes, and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence blacks. Under convict leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of the leaseholder. Sharecropping, as it was practiced during this period, often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers, who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid 1960s to the late 1970s. With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce the 13th Amendment until December 1941 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after Pearl Harbor, at the request of the president Attorney General Francis Biddle issued [[s:Circular No. 3591|Circular No. 3591]] to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery. Several months later, convict leasing was officially abolished. But aspects have persisted in other forms, while historians argue that other systems of penal labor, were all created in 1865 and convict leasing was simply the most oppressive form.  Over time a large [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|civil rights movement]] arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.\n<ref>Thomas C. Holt, ed.

PTSS is an intercultural phenomenon that shows up across those communities due to the social construction of race and the \u201cother\u201d in conjunction to the creation of racial hierarchy. Quite often these behaviors are seen as \u201ccultural\u201d, because they have been socialized as \u201cnormal\u201d within the groups. On a social scale, African American communities can reflect interdependent orientation: where identity is relational to the white majority group,and conflict has to be managed in relationship to that majority. On an inter-cultural/personal scale, African American communities can reflect independent orientation: where individual initiation and socialization are used to assert personal opinions and hold individuals accountable for their mistakes.

The system of [[convict lease|convict leasing]] began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s and officially ending in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in 1942 by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during [[World War II]], several months after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] involved the U.S. in the conflict. This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period. African Americans, due to \"vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing,\" made up the vast majority of the convicts leased.<ref>Litwack (1998), p. 271.</ref> Writer Douglas A. Blackmon writes of the system:\n\n{{quote|It was a form of bondage distinctly different from that of the antebellum South in that for most men, and the relatively few women drawn in, this slavery did not last a lifetime and did not automatically extend from one generation to the next. But it was nonetheless slavery \u2013 a system in which armies of free men, guilty of no crimes and entitled by law to freedom, were compelled to labor without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced to do the bidding of white masters through the regular application of extraordinary physical coercion.<ref>Blackmon (2008), p. 4.</ref>}}\n\nThe constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude generally, expressly [[Penal labor in the United States|permits it as a punishment for crime]].\n\n===Educational issues===\n{{Main|Education during the Slave Period|Education of freed people during the Civil War}}\n[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|An industrial school set up for ex-slaves in Richmond during Reconstruction]]\nThe [[anti-literacy law]]s after 1832 contributed greatly to the problem of widespread illiteracy facing the [[freedmen]] and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later. The problem of illiteracy and need for education was seen as one of the greatest challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the [[free enterprise system]] and support themselves during Reconstruction and thereafter.\n\nConsequently, many black and white religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans; some African Americans had started their own schools before the end of the war. Northerners helped create numerous [[normal school]]s, such as those that became [[Hampton University]] and [[Tuskegee University]], to generate teachers, as well as other [[Historically black colleges and universities|colleges for former slaves]]. Blacks held teaching as a high calling, with education the first priority for children and adults. Many of the most talented went into the field. Some of the schools took years to reach a high standard, but they managed to get thousands of teachers started. As [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] noted, the black colleges were not perfect, but \"in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South\" and \"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of black people in the land\".<ref>{{cite book |first=James D. |last=Anderson |title=The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860\u20131935 |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1988 |pages=244\u201345 |isbn=978-0-8078-1793-3 |title-link=The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860\u20131935 }}</ref>\n\nNorthern philanthropists continued to support black education in the 20th century, even as tensions rose within the black community, exemplified by [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], as to the proper emphasis between industrial and classical academic education at the college level. An example of a major donor to Hampton Institute and Tuskegee was [[George Eastman]], who also helped fund health programs at colleges and in communities.<ref name=\"Ford\">{{cite book | first = Carin T.| last = Ford | year =2004 |title=George Eastman: The Kodak Camera Man | publisher=Enslow Publishers, INC}}</ref> Collaborating with Washington in the early decades of the 20th century, philanthropist [[Julius Rosenwald]] provided matching funds for community efforts to build rural schools for black children. He insisted on white and black cooperation in the effort, wanting to ensure that white-controlled school boards made a commitment to maintain the schools. By the 1930s local parents had helped raise funds (sometimes donating labor and land) to create over 5,000 rural schools in the South. Other philanthropists, such as [[Henry H. Rogers]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]], each of whom had arisen from modest roots to become wealthy, used matching fund grants to stimulate local development of libraries and schools.\n\n===Apologies===\nOn February 24, 2007, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed House Joint Resolution Number 728 acknowledging \"with profound regret the involuntary servitude of Africans and the exploitation of Native Americans, and call for reconciliation among all Virginians\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/25/AR2007022500470.html |title=Virginia Apologizes for Role in Slavery |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Larry |last=O'Dell |date=February 25, 2007}}</ref> With the passing of this resolution, Virginia became the first state to acknowledge through the state's governing body their state's negative involvement in slavery.

By counting only named slaveholders, this approach does not acknowledge people who benefited from slavery by being in a slaveowning household, e.g. the wife and children of an owner; in 1850, there was an average of 5.55 people per household,<ref>[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/01/the-number-of-people-in-the-average-u-s-household-is-going-up-for-the-first-time-in-over-160-years/ Pew Research Center: The number of people in the average U.S. household is going up for the first time in over 160 years]</ref> so on average, around 8.05% of free persons lived in a slaveowning household.

This was in part due to the circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind written records, whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a position to leave written records. Scholars differed as to whether slavery should be considered a benign or a \"harshly exploitive\" institution.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\">Kolchin p. 134.</ref>\n\nMuch of the history written prior to the 1950s had a distinctive racist slant to it.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\" /> By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using [[archaeological]] records, black [[folklore]], and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities, within the limits of their situation and despite its precariousness. Historians who wrote in this era include [[John Blassingame]] (''[[Slave Community]]''), [[Eugene Genovese]] (''Roll, Jordan, Roll''), Leslie Howard Owens (''This Species of Property''), and [[Herbert Gutman]] (''The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom'').<ref>Kolchin pp. 137\u201343.

Slavery had been practiced in [[British America]] from early [[Slavery in the colonial United States|colonial days]], and was legal in all [[thirteen colonies]] at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Under the law, an enslaved person was treated as property and could be bought, sold, or given away. Slavery lasted in about half of U.S. [[US state|states]] until 1865. As an economic system, slavery was largely replaced by [[sharecropping]] and [[convict leasing]].\n\nBy the time of the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), the status of enslaved people had been institutionalized as a racial [[caste]] associated with African ancestry.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_history_of_american_slavery/2015/05/why_america_adopted_race_based_slavery.html |title= The Birth of Race-Based Slavery |last=Wood |first=Peter |date=2003 |journal=Slate |id= (May 19, 2015): Reprinted from \"Strange New Land: Africans in Colonial America\" by Peter H.

All Northern states had abolished slavery in some way by 1805; sometimes, abolition was a gradual process, and hundreds of people were still enslaved in the Northern states as late as the [[1840 United States Census|1840 Census]]. Some slaveowners\u2014primarily in the Upper South\u2014[[manumission|freed]] the people they had enslaved, and philanthropists and charitable groups bought and freed other enslaved people. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] was outlawed by individual states beginning during the American Revolution.

The United States became ever more polarized over the issue of slavery, split into [[slave and free states]]. Driven by labor demands from new cotton [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] in the [[Deep South]], the [[Upper South|northern slave states]] sold over a million enslaved people who were taken to the Deep South in a forced migration.

The new [[Territories of the United States|territories]] acquired via the [[Louisiana purchase]] and the [[Mexican cession]] were the subject of major political crises and compromises. By 1850, the newly-rich, cotton-growing South was threatening to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], and tensions continued to rise. Slavery was defended in the South as a \"positive good\", and large Protestant denominations split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South. \n\nWhen [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 election]] on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, seven states broke away to form the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Shortly afterward, the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] began when Confederate forces attacked the US Army's [[Fort Sumter]]. Four additional slave states then seceded after Lincoln requested arms from them to make a retaliatory strike. Due to Union measures such as the [[Confiscation Acts]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863, the war effectively ended slavery even before the institution was banned by constitutional amendment. Following the Union victory in the Civil War, slavery was made illegal in the United States upon the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in December 1865. Slavery briefly returned within US territory from 1901-1946 when the US federal government allowed the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] in the [[Philippines]] (a US possession during the first half of the twentieth century) to continue to practice slavery.

The colonies had agricultural economies. These indentured laborers were often young people who intended to become permanent residents. In some cases, convicted criminals were transported to the colonies as indentured laborers, rather than being imprisoned.

As English custom then considered baptized Christians exempt from slavery, colonists treated these Africans as indentured servants, and they joined about 1,000 English indentured servants already in the colony. The Africans were freed after a prescribed period and given the use of land and supplies by their former masters. The historian [[Ira Berlin]] noted that what he called the \"charter generation\" in the colonies was sometimes made up of mixed-race men (Atlantic Creoles) who were indentured servants, and whose ancestry was African and Iberian. They were descendants of African women and Portuguese or Spanish men who worked in African ports as traders or facilitators in the trade of enslaved people. For example, [[Anthony Johnson (colonist)|Anthony Johnson]] arrived in Virginia in 1621 from Angola as an indentured servant; he became free and a property owner, eventually buying and enslaving people himself. The transformation of the social status of Africans, from indentured servitude to slaves in a racial caste which they could not leave or escape, happened gradually.\n\nThere were no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia's history.

England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies. Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth, they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside [[English common law]]. The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects. In 1656 Virginia, [[Elizabeth Key Grinstead]], a [[mixed-race]] woman, successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. Her attorney was an English subject, which may have helped her case. (He was also the father of her mixed-race son, and the couple married after Key was freed.)<ref name=\"Banks\">[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, \"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit \u2013 Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia\"], Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School.

A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of [[common law]] practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between those who enslaved people and enslaved women, freed white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their [[mixed-race]] children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and [[miscegenation]] to within the slave quarters.\n\nIn 1672, King Charles II rechartered the [[Royal African Company]] (it had initially been set up in 1660), as an English monopoly for the African slave and commodities trade\u2014thereafter in 1698, by statute, the English parliament opened the trade to all English subjects.<ref name=\"pbs.org1\">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html</ref>  The trade of enslaved people to the mid-Atlantic colonies increased substantially in the 1680s, and by 1710 the African population in Virginia had increased to 23,100 (42% of total); Maryland contained 8,000 Africans (14.5% of total).<ref>Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), p. 88.</ref>  In the early 18th century, England passed Spain and Portugal to become the world's leading trader of enslaved people.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/index.aspx|title=European traders|last=|first=|date=|website=International Slavery Museum|publisher=National Museums Liverpool|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> From the early 18th century American merchants, especially in [[Charleston, S.C.]], challenged the monopoly of the Royal African Company, and [[Joseph Wragg]] and Benjamin Savage became the first independent traders of enslaved people to break through the monopoly by the 1730s.<ref>Pamela Chase Hain, A Confederate Chronicle: The Life of a Civil War Survivor, p. 2, 2005</ref>\n\nThe Virginia [[Slave codes]] of 1705 further defined as slaves those people imported from nations that were not [[Christians|Christian]].

They transported others to the Caribbean islands, and some to England.\n\nAt the same time, the British were transporting Loyalists and their slaves, primarily to the Caribbean, but some to Nova Scotia.

Similarly, over half of the black people evacuated in 1782 from Charleston by the British to the West Indies and Florida were slaves owned by white Loyalists.\n\nSlaves and free blacks also fought on the side of rebels during the Revolutionary War.

[T]he {{bracket|[[Somerset v Stewart|Somerset]]}} ruling caused a sensation.... Numerous colonial newspapers covered it and warned of the tyranny it represented. Multiple historians have pointed out that in part because of the Somerset case, slavery joined other issues in helping to gradually drive apart the patriots and their colonial governments. ...[L]arge numbers of the enslaved came to see the struggle as one between freedom [under the British] and continued subjugation. As Waldstreicher writes, \u201cThe black-British alliance decisively pushed planters in these [Southern] states toward independence.\u201d\n\nThe culmination of this was the [[Dunmore Proclamation]].... A member of [[Colonial period of South Carolina|\nSouth Carolina]]\u2019s delegation to the Continental Congress wrote that this act did more to sever the ties between Britain and its colonies \"than any other expedient which could possibly have been thought of.\" The historian [[Jill Lepore]] writes in her recent book, ''These Truths: A History of the United States,'' \"Not the taxes and the tea, not the shots at Lexington and Concord, not the siege of Boston; rather, it was this act, Dunmore's offer of freedom to slaves, that tipped the scales in favor of American independence.\"<ref>{{cite news\n|newspaper=[[New York Times]]\n|date=December 20, 2019\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/magazine/letter-to-the-editor-historians-critique-the-1619-project-and-we-respond.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\n|title=Editor's response\n|first=Jake\n|last=Silverstein\n|authorlink=Jake Silverstein}}</ref>}}\n\nWilentz later argued there were many more anti-slavery activists in the colonies at the time of the Revolution than in Britain, and Hannah-Jones, while she stood by her piece, conceded she phrased the contention too strongly in a way that might mislead about all the colonies and people involved.  She said subsequent materials based on the series would later be better contextualized.<ref name=Serwer/>\n\n===Constitution of the United States===\nSlavery was a contentious issue in the writing and approval of the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref>Keith L.

As the historian James Oliver Horton noted, prominent slaveholder politicians and the commodity crops of the South had a strong influence on United States politics and economy. Horton said,\n\n<blockquote>in the 72 years between the election of George Washington and the election of Abraham Lincoln, 50 of those years [had] a slaveholder as president of the United States, and, for that whole period of time, there was never a person elected to a second term who was not a slaveholder.<ref name=\"pbs.org\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe power of Southern states in Congress lasted until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], affecting national policies, legislation, and appointments.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/social_issues/jan-june07/divided_01-25.html \"Interview: James Oliver Horton: Exhibit Reveals History of Slavery in New York City\"], PBS ''Newshour'', January 25, 2007.

This was expansion of the white, monied population: younger men seeking their fortune.\n\nThe most valuable crop that could be grown on a plantation in that climate was cotton. That crop was labor-intensive, and the least-costly laborers were slaves.

He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white Southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the South, were bringing the white and black populations to a state of equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.<ref name=\"Alexis de Tocqueville\">{{cite book|title=Democracy in America (Volume 1)|last=de Tocqueville |first=Alexise|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States|isbn=978-1-4209-2910-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert E.

Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor management. [[John C. Calhoun]], in a famous speech in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1837, declared that slavery was \"instead of an evil, a good\u2014a positive good\". Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this respect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in wealth and numbers\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beard |first1=Charles A. |authorlink1=Charles A.

In a speech to the Senate on March 4, 1858, Hammond developed his \"Mudsill Theory,\" defending his view on slavery stating: \"Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill.\" Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/> He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: \"The difference\u2026 is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment,\" while those in the North had to search for employment.<ref name=\"Mudsill Theory\"/>\n\nGeorge Fitzhugh used assumptions about white superiority to justify slavery, writing that, \"the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child.\" In ''The Universal Law of Slavery'', Fitzhugh argues that slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy, and cannot compete with the intelligent European white race. He states that \"The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the freest people in the world.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\">{{cite web|last=Fitzhugh|first=George|authorlink=George Fitzhugh|title=The Universal Law of Slavery|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3141t.html|accessdate=December 10, 2017}}</ref> Without the South, \"He (slave) would become an insufferable burden to society\" and \"Society has the right to prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery.\"<ref name=\"Universal Law\"/>\n\nOn March 21, 1861, [[Alexander Stephens]], Vice President of the Confederacy, delivered his [[Cornerstone Speech]].

What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted.

It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away...

Most free blacks lived in the North, but even in the [[Upper South]], the proportion of free blacks went from less than one percent of all blacks to more than 10 percent, even as the total number of slaves was increasing through imports.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993 pp. 77-78\">Peter Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', pp. 77\u201378, 81.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, passed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]], slavery was prohibited in the territories northwest of the [[Ohio River]]; existing slaves were not freed for years, although they could no longer be sold. This was a compromise. [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed in 1784 to end slavery in all the territories, but his bill lost in the [[Congress of the Confederation|Congress]] by one vote. The territories south of the Ohio River (and Missouri) had authorized slavery.<ref>Paul Finkelman, ''Encyclopedia of American civil liberties'' (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TXoKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA845 Volume 1, p. 845 online.]</ref>\n\nNortherners predominated in the westward movement into the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] territory after the American Revolution; as the states were organized, they voted to prohibit slavery in their constitutions when they achieved statehood: Ohio in 1803, Indiana in 1816, and Illinois in 1818. What developed was a Northern block of free states united into one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti-slavery culture. The exceptions were the areas along the Ohio River settled by Southerners: the southern portions of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. Residents of those areas generally shared in Southern culture and attitudes. In addition, these areas were devoted to agriculture longer than the industrializing northern parts of these states, and some farmers used slave labor. In Illinois, for example, while the trade in slaves was prohibited, it was legal to bring slaves from Kentucky into Illinois and use them there, as long as the slaves left Illinois one day per year (they were \"visiting\"). The emancipation of slaves in the North led to the growth in the population of Northern free blacks, from several hundred in the 1770s to nearly 50,000 by 1810.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 104.</ref>\n\n==Agitation against slavery==\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\n[[File:Benjamin Kent, Old Burying Ground, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Kent]], [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)|Old Burying Ground]], Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n\nThere was legal agitation against slavery in the 13 colonies starting in 1752 by lawyer [[Benjamin Kent]], whose cases were recorded by one of his understudies, the future president [[John Adams]].

They worked to raise awareness about the evils of slavery, and to build support for abolition.\n\nThis struggle took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners, who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. But slavery was entwined with the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping, and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery, as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North. The northern textile mills in New York and New England processed Southern cotton and manufactured clothes to outfit slaves. By 1822 half of New York City's exports were related to cotton.<ref name=\"divided\">[http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/G1/G1ReadMore.php \"King Cotton: Dramatic Growth of the Cotton Trade\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330070752/http://nydivided.org/VirtualExhibit/T1/G1/G1ReadMore.php |date=March 30, 2013 }}, ''New York Divided: Slavery and the Civil War'', New-York Historical Society, accessed May 12, 2012</ref>\n\nSlaveholders began to refer to slavery as the \"[[peculiar institution]]\" to differentiate it from other examples of [[forced labor]].

Cuffe believed that African Americans could more easily \"rise to be a people\" in Africa than in the U.S. because of the latter's slavery, racial discrimination, and limits on black rights. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts encouraged the ACS to promote further settlements. The [[Quakers]] opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. Slaveholders opposed abolition, but wanted to get rid off [[freedmen]], which they saw as potential leaders of rebellions and people who encouraged slaves to run away.</ref> The ACS was made up mostly of [[Quakers]] and slaveholders, who found uneasy common ground in support of what was incorrectly called \"repatriation\". But by this time most black Americans were native-born and did not want to emigrate, saying they were no more African than the Americans were British. Rather, they wanted full rights in the United States, where their families had lived and worked for generations.\n\nIn 1822 the ACS and affiliated state societies established what would become the colony of [[Liberia]], in West Africa.<ref name=\"WDLMap\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/446/ |title = Map of Liberia, West Africa |work = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1830 |accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref> The ACS assisted thousands of freedmen and free blacks (with legislated limits) to emigrate there from the United States. Many white people considered this preferable to [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] in the United States. [[Henry Clay]], one of the founders and a prominent slaveholder politician from Kentucky, said that blacks faced\n\n<blockquote>unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country.

After 1830, abolitionist and newspaper publisher [[William Lloyd Garrison]] promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as a personal sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness on the part of some Southerners, who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he attempted to do at [[Harper's Ferry]]. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. The eloquent [[Frederick Douglass]] became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) was an international bestseller and aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous [[anti-Tom novels]] by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.\n\n===Prohibiting the international trade===\nWhile under the Constitution, Congress could not prohibit the import slave trade until 1808, the third Congress regulated it in the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]], which prohibited shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade. Subsequent acts [[Slave Trade Act of 1800|in 1800]] and 1803 sought to discourage the trade by limiting investment in import trading and prohibiting importation into states that had abolished slavery, which most in the North had by that time.<ref name=\"Regulation of the Trade\">{{cite web | url=http://abolition.nypl.org/essays/us_constitution/4/ | title=Regulation of the Trade | publisher=[[New York Public Library]] | accessdate=June 23, 2014}}</ref> The final [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] was adopted in 1807, effective in 1808.

From 1819, they were assisted by forces from the United States Navy. With the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842, the relationship with Britain was formalized, and the two countries jointly ran the [[Blockade of Africa]] with their navies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|title=Potomac Books \u2013 University of Nebraska Press \u2013 University of Nebraska Press|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015130620/http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=63330|archivedate=October 15, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Post-revolution Southern manumissions===\nAlthough Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware were slave states, the latter two already had a high proportion of free blacks by the outbreak of war. Following the Revolution, the three legislatures made [[manumission]] easier, allowed by deed or will. Quaker and Methodist ministers particularly urged slaveholders to free their slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than 1% in 1792 to more than 10% by 1810.<ref name=\"Peter Kolchin 1993 pp. 77-78\" /> In Delaware, nearly 75% of blacks were free by 1810.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 78.</ref>\n\nIn the US as a whole, by 1810 the number of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5% of all blacks.<ref name=\"PeterKolchin\">Peter Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 81.</ref> After that period few slaves were freed, as the development of [[Plantations in the American South|cotton plantations]] featuring short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices were paid.<ref>Kolchin (1993), ''American Slavery'', p. 87.</ref>\n\nSouth Carolina made manumission more difficult, requiring legislative approval of every instance of manumission. Several Southern states required manumitted slaves to leave the state within 30 days.\n\n===Domestic slave trade and forced migration===\n[[File:Slavery map.jpg|thumb|right|Movement of slaves between 1790 and 1860]]\n\nThe growing international demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west in search of suitable land. In addition, the invention of the [[cotton gin]] in 1793 enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the [[War of 1812]], fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820 the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the [[Deep South]] and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it.<ref>''The People's Chronology'', 1994, by James Trager.</ref> As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.<ref>Kolchin p. 96.\n\nThrough the domestic slave trade, about one million enslaved African Americans were forcibly removed from the Upper South to the Deep South, with some transported by ship in the coastwise trade. In 1834, [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]] grew half the nation's cotton; by 1859, along with [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], they grew 78%. By 1859 cotton growth in the [[Carolinas]] had fallen to just 10% of the national total.

These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship. Characterizing it as the \"central event\" in the life of a slave between the [[American Revolution]] and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, \"the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 161\u201362.</ref> Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families who had been in the United States for many generations.<ref name=\"CUP\" />\n\nIn the 1840s, almost 300,000 slaves were transported, with Alabama and Mississippi receiving 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were moved. Michael Tadman wrote in ''Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South'' (1989) that 60\u201370% of inter-regional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820 a child in the Upper South had a 30% chance of being sold south by 1860.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201369. Kolchin p. 96. Kolchin notes that Fogel and Engerman maintained that 84% of slaves moved with their families but \"most other scholars assign far greater weight \u2026 to slave sales.\" Ransome (p. 582) notes that Fogel and Engermann based their conclusions on the study of some counties in Maryland in the 1830s and attempted to extrapolate that analysis as reflective of the entire South over the entire period.</ref> The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, but mortality was higher than the normal death rate.\n[[File:Slave Market-Atlanta Georgia 1864.jpg|Slave trader's business in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1864|thumb]]\n[[Interregional slave trade|Slave traders]] transported two-thirds of the slaves who moved west.<ref>{{cite book |first=Allan |last=Kulikoff |title=The Agrarian Origins of American Capitalism |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8139-1388-9 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli/page/226 226]\u201369 |url=https://archive.org/details/agrarianoriginso00kuli |url-access=registration }}</ref> Only a minority moved with their families and existing master. Slave traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave families; in the early years, planters demanded only the young male slaves needed for heavy labor. Later, in the interest of creating a \"self-reproducing labor force\", planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women. Berlin wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The slave trade industry developed its own unique language, with terms such as \"prime hands, bucks, breeding wenches, and \"fancy girls\" coming into common use.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 166\u201369.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the \"economic revival of once depressed seaboard states\" as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale.<ref>Kolchin, p. 98.</ref>\n\nSome traders moved their \"chattels\" by sea, with [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] on the Ohio River, and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi. Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards, and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition, other vendors provided clothes, food, and supplies for slaves. As the trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin concluded, \"In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched.\"<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 168\u201371.</ref>\n\nOnce the trip ended, slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly different from most labor in the Upper South. Clearing trees and starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work. A combination of inadequate nutrition, bad water, and exhaustion from both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and produced casualties. New plantations were located at rivers' edges for ease of transportation and travel. [[Mosquito]]es and other environmental challenges spread disease, which took the lives of many slaves. They had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their previous homes. The death rate was so high that, in the first few years of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness, some planters preferred whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led owners and overseers to rely on violence for control. Many of the slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the \"sunrise-to-sunset gang labor\" required by their new life. Slaves were driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or [[wheat]] back east. Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality of their lives by raising their own [[livestock]] or tending vegetable gardens, for either their own consumption or trade, as they could in the east.<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 175\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]], French colonists had established [[sugar cane]] plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop. After the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, Americans entered the state and joined the sugar cultivation. Between 1810 and 1830, planters bought slaves from the North and the number of slaves increased from less than 10,000 to more than 42,000. Planters preferred young males, who represented two-thirds of the slave purchases. Dealing with sugar cane was even more physically demanding than growing cotton. The largely young, unmarried male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners \"especially savage\".<ref>Berlin, ''Generations of Captivity'', pp. 179\u201380.</ref>\n\n[[New Orleans]] became nationally important as a slave market and port, as slaves were shipped from there upriver by [[steamboat]] to plantations on the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, it had the largest slave market in North America. It became the wealthiest and the fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1999.</ref> The trading season was from September to May, after the harvest.<ref>Johnson (1999), ''Soul by Soul'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nSlave traders were men of low reputation, even in the South.

The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave.<ref>Moore, p. 114.</ref> Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.\n\n[[William Wells Brown]], who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick 80 pounds per day of cotton, while women were required to pick 70 pounds; if any slave failed in his or her quota, they were subject to whip lashes for each pound they were short.

This was a common requirement in other states as well, and locally run patrols (known to slaves as ''pater rollers'') often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations. In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves. In Virginia, a slave was not permitted to drink in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings.

Following [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion in 1831, which raised white fears throughout the South, some states also prohibited or restricted religious gatherings of slaves, or required that they be officiated by white men.

The transition from indentured servants to slaves is cited to show that slaves offered greater profits to their owners.  Thus, it is the near-universal consensus among economic historians and economists that slavery was not \"a system irrationally kept in existence by plantation owners who failed to perceive or were indifferent to their best economic interests\".<ref name=\"Whaples 1995 139\u2013154\">{{cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|title=Where is There Consensus among American Economic Historians?

Fogel's 1989 work, ''Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery'', elaborated on the moral indictment of slavery which ultimately led to its abolition.\n\n===Efficiency of slaves===\n[[File:RebeccaAugustRosaSlaveChildren.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Mixed-race slave girls of predominant European ancestry, New Orleans, 1863. (See also [[white slave propaganda]]).]]\nScholars disagree on how to quantify efficiency of slavery. In ''Time on the Cross'', Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to [[total factor productivity]] (TFP)\u2014the output per average unit of input on a farm. Using this measurement, Southern farms that enslaved black people using the [[gang system]] were 35% more efficient than Northern farms which used free labor. Under the gang system, groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each group was like a part of a machine. If perceived to be working below his capacity, a slave could be punished. Fogel argues that this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent and that slaves and free laborers had similar quality of life; however, there is controversy on this last point.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\">{{cite book|last=Fogel & Engerman|title=Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery|year=1974|publisher=W.W.

Economies of scale, effective management, and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming.\" 48 percent of the economists agreed without provisos, while 24 percent agreed when provisos were included in the statement. On the other hand, 58 percent of economic historians and 42 percent of economists disagreed with Fogel and Engerman's \"proposition that the material (not psychological) conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the decades before the Civil War\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Whaples|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Whaples|journal=[[The Journal of Economic History]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=141, 146\u2013147|jstor=2123771|title=Where Is There Consensus Among American Economic Historians?

Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield high profits. Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened, the slave prices would have increased even more, an average of more than 50 percent by 1890.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />{{rp|96}}\n[[File:Slavery19.jpg|thumb|left|A slave auction, 1853]]\nPrices reflected the characteristics of the slave\u2014such factors as sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher than their male counterparts up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children and produce more slaves, in addition to serving as laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave's back for whipping scars\u2014a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master's brutality, and would lower the slave's price.<ref name=\"McInnis2011\" /> Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.<ref name=\"Fogel and Engeman\" />\n\nThe conditions of the market led to shocks in the supply and demand of slaves, which in turn changed prices. For example, slaves became more expensive after 1808, when no more could be imported. The market for the products of their work also affected slaves' economic value: demand for slaves fell with the price of cotton in 1840. Anticipation of changes also had a huge influence on prices. As the Civil War progressed, there was great doubt that slavery would continue to be legal, and prime males in New Orleans were sold at $1,116 by 1862 as opposed to $1,381 in 1861.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kotlikoff|first=L.

Davis writes that black women were needed for their \u201csexual and reproductive labor to satisfy the economic, political, and personal interest of white men of the elite class\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/107 107]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Prinicple\" The Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/107}}</ref> articulating that black women's reproductive capacity was important in the maintenance of the system of slavery due to its ability to perpetuate an enslaved workforce. She is also drawing attention to black women's labor being needed to maintain the aristocracy of a white ruling class, due to the intimate nature of reproduction and its potential for producing more enslaved peoples.\n\nDue to the institution of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', black women's wombs became the site where slavery was developed and transferred,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108 108]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/108}}</ref> meaning that black women were not only used for their physical labor, but for their sexual and reproductive labor as well.\n\n<blockquote>\"The rule that the children\u2019s status follows their mothers\u2019 was a foundational one for our economy.

Davis writes how black women performed labor under slavery, writing: \u201c[black women were] male when convenient and horrifically female when needed\u201d<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=Sister Circle: Black Women and Work|last=Davis|first=Adrienne|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0813530611|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/119 119]|chapter=\"Don't Let Nobody Bother Yo' Principle\" The Sexual Economy of American Slavery|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sistercircle00rutg/page/119}}</ref> The fluctuating expectations of black women's gendered labor under slavery disrupted the white normative roles that were assigned to white men and white women. This ungendering black women received under slavery contributed to the systemic dehumanization experienced by enslaved black women, as they were unable to receive the expectations or experiences of either gender within the white binary.\n\nDavis\u2019 arguments addresses the fact that under slavery, black women's sexuality became linked to the economic and public sphere, making their intimate lives into public institutions. Black women's physical labor was gendered as masculine under slavery when they were needed to yield more profit, but their reproductive capacities and sexual labor was equally as important in maintaining white power over black communities and perpetuating an enslaved workforce.<ref name=\":02\" /> This blurring of the line between the private and public sphere is another way Davis articulates how black women's sexuality and reproduction was commodified and exploited for capitalist gain, as their private and intimate lives became disrupted by the violence at the hands of white men, and their sexual capacities became an important part of the public marketplace and United States economy.\n\n==1850s==\n\n[[File:Eastman Johnson - A Ride for Liberty -- The Fugitive Slaves - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eastman Johnson]] (American, 1824\u20131906).

Richards, ''The Slave Power: The Free North and Southern Domination, 1780\u20141860'' (LSU Press, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe abolitionists, realizing that the total elimination of slavery was as an immediate goal unrealistic, worked to prevent expansion of slavery into the western territories which eventually would be new states. The [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], and the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis dealt with whether new states would be slave or free, or how that was to be decided. Both sides were anxious about effects of these decisions on the balance of power in the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]].\n\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\nAfter the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, border fighting broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a [[slave state|slave]] or [[free state (USA)|free state]] was [[Popular Sovereignty|left to the inhabitants]]. Migrants from free and slave states moved into the territory to prepare for the vote on slavery. Abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the fighting in \"Bleeding Kansas,\" but so too were many white Southerners who opposed abolition.\n\nAbraham Lincoln's and the Republicans' political platform in 1860 was to stop slavery's expansion. Historian James McPherson says that in a famous speech in 1858, Lincoln said American republicanism can be purified by restricting the further expansion of slavery as the first step to putting it on the road to 'ultimate extinction.' Southerners took Lincoln at his word. When he won the presidency they left the Union to escape the 'ultimate extinction' of slavery.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=James M.

Sandford|Freedom suits}}\nWith the development of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states. Most free states not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases.<ref>Paul Finkelman, '' Dred Scott v. Sandford: a brief history with documents'' (Bedford Books, 1997). </ref>  [[Dred Scott]] and his wife Harriet Scott each [[freedom suit|sued for freedom]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after the death of their master, based on their having been held in a free territory (the northern part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from which slavery was excluded under the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]]). (Later the two cases were combined under Dred Scott's name.) Scott filed suit for freedom in 1846 and went through two state trials, the first denying and the second granting freedom to the couple (and, by extension, their two daughters, who had also been held illegally in free territories). For 28 years, Missouri state precedent had generally respected laws of neighboring free states and territories, ruling for freedom in such transit cases where slaves had been held illegally in free territory. But in the Dred Scott case, the State Supreme Court ruled against the slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Don E. |last=Fehrenbacher |authorlink=Don E.

Taney]], in a sweeping decision, denied Scott his freedom. The 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|decision]], decided 7\u20132, held that a slave did not become free when taken into a free state; Congress could not bar slavery from a territory; and people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves, or their descendants, could never be citizens and thus had no status to bring suit in a U.S. court. A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state. Many Republicans, including [[Abraham Lincoln]], considered the decision unjust and evidence that the [[Slave Power]] had seized control of the Supreme Court. Anti-slavery groups were enraged and slave owners encouraged, escalating the tensions that led to civil war.<ref>Fehrenbacher, ''The Dred Scott case: Its significance in American law and politics'' (2001).</ref>\n\n==Civil War and emancipation==\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n\n===1860 presidential election===\n\nThe divisions became fully exposed with the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis: America Before the Civil War, 1848\u20131861'' (Harper & Row\n, 1976).</ref>\n\nLincoln, the Republican, won with a plurality of popular votes and a majority of [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]]. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states. Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be disastrous for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who were not paid. The slave owners feared that ending the balance could lead to the domination of the federal government by the northern free states. This led seven southern states to [[Ordinance of Secession|secede from the Union]]. When the southern forces attacked a US Army installation at Fort Sumter, the [[American Civil War]] began and four additional slave states seceded. Northern leaders had viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically, but with secession, they viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, the [[Confederate States of America]], with control over the [[Mississippi River]] and parts of the [[Western United States|West]], as politically unacceptable.  Most of all they could not accept this repudiation of American nationalism.<ref>Potter, pp 448\u2013554. </ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe consequent [[American Civil War]], beginning in 1861, led to the end of chattel slavery in America. Not long after the war broke out, through a legal maneuver credited to Union General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]], a lawyer by profession, slaves who came into Union \"possession\" were considered [[contraband (American Civil War)|\"contraband of war\"]]. General Butler ruled that they were not subject to return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war. Soon word spread, and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory, desiring to be declared \"contraband\". Many of the \"contrabands\" joined the [[Union Army]] as workers or troops, forming entire regiments of the [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]]. Others went to refugee camps such as the [[Grand Contraband Camp]] near [[Fort Monroe]] or fled to northern cities. General Butler's interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which declared that any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces.\n\n[[File:Timothy H. O'Sullivan (American - Slaves, J. J. Smith's Plantation, South Carolina - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|Slaves on J. J. Smith's cotton plantation near [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], photographed by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan|Timothy O'Sullivan]] standing before their quarters in 1862]]\nAt the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As Congressman [[George Washington Julian|George W. Julian]] of Indiana put it in an 1862 speech in Congress, the slaves \"cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.\"<ref>[[James M.

In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free\". It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Leon F. |last=Litwack |authorlink=Leon Litwack |title=Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-394-50099-7 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bi2aAAAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states.

Negotiations with the South?--> Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that\n\n{{quote|If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong \u2026 And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling \u2026 I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.<ref>Lincoln's Letter to A. G. Hodges, April 4, 1864.</ref>}}\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a powerful action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy as soon as the Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states that bordered the Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]], at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total population of the United States.\n\nBased on the President's war powers, the Emancipation Proclamation applied to territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.<ref>James McPherson, ''The War that Never Goes Away''.</ref> Lincoln played a leading role in getting the constitutionally-required two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment,<ref name=\"Who Freed\">James McPherson, \"Drawn With the Sword\", from the article \"Who Freed the Slaves?\"</ref> which made emancipation universal and permanent.\n[[File:Family of African American slaves on Smith's Plantation Beaufort South Carolina.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Four [[generation]]s of a [[slave]] family, Smith's Plantation, [[Beaufort, South Carolina]], 1862]]\nEnslaved African Americans had not waited for Lincoln before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in Union-controlled areas such as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and the [[Hampton Roads]] region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The [[American Missionary Association]] entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.\n\nIn addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served with distinction in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors. Most were escaped slaves. The Confederacy was outraged by armed black soldiers and refused to treat them as [[prisoners of war]]. They murdered many, as at the [[Fort Pillow Massacre]], and re-enslaved others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Doyle |first=Robert C.

Thousands of slaves were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union armies marched across the South. Emancipation came to the remaining southern slaves after the surrender of all Confederate troops in spring 1865.\n\nIn spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates discussed arming slaves. Finally in early 1865 General Robert E. Lee said black soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed.

Blackmon]] reported in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[Slavery By Another Name]]'' that many blacks were virtually enslaved under [[convict leasing]] programs, which started after the Civil War. Most Southern states had no prisons; they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor, and the lessee paid for food and board. The incentives for abuse were satisfied.\n\nThe continued involuntary servitude took various forms, but the primary forms included [[Convict lease|convict leasing]], [[peon]]age, and [[sharecropping]], with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well. By the 1930s, whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South. Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor, and many blacks left the South in the Great Migration. Jurisdictions and states created fines and sentences for a wide variety of minor crimes, and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence blacks. Under convict leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of the leaseholder. Sharecropping, as it was practiced during this period, often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers, who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid 1960s to the late 1970s. With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce the 13th Amendment until December 1941 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after Pearl Harbor, at the request of the president Attorney General Francis Biddle issued [[s:Circular No. 3591|Circular No. 3591]] to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to actively investigate and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery. Several months later, convict leasing was officially abolished. But aspects have persisted in other forms, while historians argue that other systems of penal labor, were all created in 1865 and convict leasing was simply the most oppressive form.  Over time a large [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|civil rights movement]] arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.\n<ref>Thomas C. Holt, ed. ''Major Problems in African-American History: From Freedom to \"Freedom Now,\" 1865\u20131990s'' (2000),</ref>\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9MIn_9rKQzM Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome](PTSS) is the theory behind the adaptive and survival behavior reflected in African American communities, as a result from chattel slavery and multigenerational trauma from slaves to their decedents. PTSS is an intercultural phenomenon that shows up across those communities due to the social construction of race and the \u201cother\u201d in conjunction to the creation of racial hierarchy. Quite often these behaviors are seen as \u201ccultural\u201d, because they have been socialized as \u201cnormal\u201d within the groups. On a social scale, African American communities can reflect interdependent orientation: where identity is relational to the white majority group,and conflict has to be managed in relationship to that majority. On an inter-cultural/personal scale, African American communities can reflect independent orientation: where individual initiation and socialization are used to assert personal opinions and hold individuals accountable for their mistakes.

The system of [[convict lease|convict leasing]] began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s and officially ending in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in 1942 by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] during [[World War II]], several months after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] involved the U.S. in the conflict. This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period. African Americans, due to \"vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing,\" made up the vast majority of the convicts leased.<ref>Litwack (1998), p. 271.</ref> Writer Douglas A. Blackmon writes of the system:\n\n{{quote|It was a form of bondage distinctly different from that of the antebellum South in that for most men, and the relatively few women drawn in, this slavery did not last a lifetime and did not automatically extend from one generation to the next. But it was nonetheless slavery \u2013 a system in which armies of free men, guilty of no crimes and entitled by law to freedom, were compelled to labor without compensation, were repeatedly bought and sold, and were forced to do the bidding of white masters through the regular application of extraordinary physical coercion.<ref>Blackmon (2008), p. 4.</ref>}}\n\nThe constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude generally, expressly [[Penal labor in the United States|permits it as a punishment for crime]].\n\n===Educational issues===\n{{Main|Education during the Slave Period|Education of freed people during the Civil War}}\n[[File:Freedmen richmond sewing women.jpg|thumb|An industrial school set up for ex-slaves in Richmond during Reconstruction]]\nThe [[anti-literacy law]]s after 1832 contributed greatly to the problem of widespread illiteracy facing the [[freedmen]] and other African Americans after Emancipation and the Civil War 35 years later. The problem of illiteracy and need for education was seen as one of the greatest challenges confronting these people as they sought to join the [[free enterprise system]] and support themselves during Reconstruction and thereafter.\n\nConsequently, many black and white religious organizations, former Union Army officers and soldiers, and wealthy philanthropists were inspired to create and fund educational efforts specifically for the betterment of African Americans; some African Americans had started their own schools before the end of the war. Northerners helped create numerous [[normal school]]s, such as those that became [[Hampton University]] and [[Tuskegee University]], to generate teachers, as well as other [[Historically black colleges and universities|colleges for former slaves]].

This was in part due to the circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind written records, whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a position to leave written records. Scholars differed as to whether slavery should be considered a benign or a \"harshly exploitive\" institution.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\">Kolchin p. 134.</ref>\n\nMuch of the history written prior to the 1950s had a distinctive racist slant to it.<ref name=\"Kolchin p. 134\" /> By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using [[archaeological]] records, black [[folklore]], and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities, within the limits of their situation and despite its precariousness. Historians who wrote in this era include [[John Blassingame]] (''[[Slave Community]]''), [[Eugene Genovese]] (''Roll, Jordan, Roll''), Leslie Howard Owens (''This Species of Property''), and [[Herbert Gutman]] (''The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom'').<ref>Kolchin pp. 137\u201343.
