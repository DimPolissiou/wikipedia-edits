Another one of the first pioneers, Michael Zeis (born 1885) of [[Holdingford, Minnesota]] described the town: \u201cI also started one main cigar shop, made cigars all by hand in my spare time and sold them at Bowman, Rhame\u201d. Zeis lived in the town from 1908 to 1918, working for the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]], but left the town when he was drafted for World War I in 1918. The town had its own doctor, pioneer Dr. Frederick A. Bordwell and the town soon opened its own Opera House, Barber Building, the [[Mystic Theatre (Marmarth, North Dakota)|Mystic Theatre]] in 1914, a car dealership and Canadian Frank Gibbs\u2019 hardware store. The town was also known to jail the notorious Jesse James\u2019 gang, consisting of the Old West outlaws Cole, Bob, and Jim. Gibbs later wrote about the town: \u201cThere were two banks, the post office, two hotels, a jewelry store, a gas station, a hospital, the train station, a meat store, a theatre, a car dealership, a laundry, and a hardware store\u201d.<ref>Gavett, Joseph L.

Another one of the first pioneers, Michael Zeis (born 1885) of [[Holdingford, Minnesota]] described the town: \u201cI also started one main cigar shop, made cigars all by hand in my spare time and sold them at Bowman, Rhame\u201d. Zeis lived in the town from 1908 to 1918, working for the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]], but left the town when he was drafted for World War I in 1918. The town had its own doctor, pioneer Dr. Frederick A. Bordwell and the town soon opened its own Opera House, Barber Building, the [[Mystic Theatre (Marmarth, North Dakota)|Mystic Theatre]] in 1914, a car dealership and Canadian Frank Gibbs\u2019 hardware store. The town was also known to jail the notorious Jesse James\u2019 gang, consisting of the Old West outlaws Cole, Bob, and Jim. Gibbs later wrote about the town: \u201cThere were two banks, the post office, two hotels, a jewelry store, a gas station, a hospital, the train station, a meat store, a theatre, a car dealership, a laundry, and a hardware store\u201d.<ref>Gavett, Joseph L.

The population was 6,628 at the 2000 census but decreased by 10% to 5,967 in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasalmanac.com/texas-towns/marlin|title=MARLIN &#124; Texas Almanac|date=Nov 22, 2010|website=texasalmanac.com|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019}}</ref> Since 1851, it has been the [[county seat]] of Falls County. Marlin has been given the nickname \"the Hot Mineral Water City of Texas\". Mineral waters were found there in 1892.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and Antebellum Era (1851-1861)===\nThe city of Marlin is located {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of the [[Brazos River]], which runs through the center of the county. The low falls on the river southwest of present-day Marlin was the site of [[Sarahville de Viesca, Texas|Sarahville de Viesca]], established in 1834 by [[Sterling C. Robertson]].\n\nThe act of the state legislature creating Falls County that passed on January 28, 1850 established Viesca (renamed Fort Milam) as the county seat. Citizens petitioned to choose their own location and a vote was held on January 21, 1851 that established the county seat at Adams, near the home of Dr. Allensworth Adams. On March 22, 1851, the Falls County commissioners court voted to rename Adams the \"Town of Marlin\" to honor former Robertson County alcalde [[John Marlin (Texas)|John Marlin]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe new town of Marlin was laid out around a courthouse square and a log courthouse was constructed which also served as a school and church. In 1854 a new courthouse was constructed for $5,000, painted white with dark green shutters and a chrome yellow door.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1859, the population of Marlin was 2,875 whites; 1,225 slaves; 9 free blacks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Early Schools ===\nThe first schools in Falls County were private schools established at Marlin. A tuition school, Marlin Male and Female Academy, was located on Ward Street in 1871, north of the courthouse square. The school was renamed and relocated before finally being sold in 1886, only to be destroyed by fire in 1900. A new public brick school was constructed in 1903 and a high school was completed in 1917. The [[Marlin Independent School District]] was established in 1923. Nearly half a century before in 1875, two other schools for African Americans were organized. The two black schools were dependent on state funds, and met in the African and Baptist churches. In 1916, the city council voted to build a school for blacks; later, the Booker T. Washington High School was constructed in 1951 on Commerce Street and designed by the architectural firm of Thomas, Jameson and Merrill.  This school remains standing but is vacant. The two school districts merged in 1968 into the Marlin Independent School District. In 1900, the town's Jewish residents organized a [[Sunday school]].<ref>[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/marlin.html \"Marlin, Texas\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616174617/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/marlin.html |date=2012-06-16 }}, found in the [http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/index.html Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities],</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) ===\nThe town of Marlin was formally incorporated by the state legislature on January 12, 1867. Two former slaves served as elected or appointed officials in Marlin: Nelson Denson and Lige Moore.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Houston and Texas Central Railway|Houston & Texas Central Railway]] reached Marlin on 1871 as a stop on the \"Waco Tap\" line that extended northwest from [[Bremond, Texas|Bremond]] (Robertson County) to Waco.  The location of the depot on the eastern side of the town led to the development of a commercial district eastward from the courthouse square along Live Oak Street.\n\nIn 1875, the 1854 courthouse burned and a new brick courthouse was constructed. The courthouse was badly damaged in a storm in 1886 and replaced with a new structure designed by architect [[Eugene T. Heiner]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The Mineral Water Era (1890s-1960s) ===\nIn 1891, the City of Marlin issued bonds worth $25,000 to drill an [[artesian well]].  Hot mineral water was accidentally discovered and later found to have medicinal properties. To harness the potential benefit of these \"healing waters,\" the first bath house was constructed in 1895 with several others to follow. A least two of those early houses had large swimming pools with ornate covered buildings. Other bath houses were subsequently  constructed that included individual bathing areas with marble tubs, and cooling rooms with available massages for a full spa treatment. Thousands were soon attracted to Marlin to \"take the cure.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile Marlin had a number of small hotels in the 19th century, the construction of the three-story Arlington Hotel in 1895 demonstrated the economic impact and potential of the mineral water industry.  The hotel and adjacent bathhouse burned in January 1899 but were both replaced with more elaborate structures that opened in 1901.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Marlin 1851-1976|last=Marlin Bicentennial Heritage Committee|publisher=Marlin Chamber of Commerce|year=1976|isbn=|location=Waco, Texas|pages=17}}</ref>  The new Arlington Hotel hosted notable community events, and statewide conventions. Other than the Hilton and the numerous boarding houses (such as Captain Bourrupt's and the Harris Houses) there were several other hotels, among them the Fannin, the Majestic and the Imperial, all on Coleman Street and within a few blocks of the public hot water fountain and the mineral water wells - on a sort of bath house row.\n\nIn 1929, [[Conrad Hilton]] began construction of a [[Hilton Hotel]] that was opened on May 27, 1930 at a cost of $375,000 and to which Marlin citizens and businesses contributed $50,000.<ref name=\":0\" />  The nine-floor, 110-room hotel remains the tallest building in Marlin and was built on Coleman Street across from the Marlin Sanitarium Bathhouse which burned in the early 1990s. The hotel was connected to the bathhouse by a tunnel that has NOT been filled in but is inaccessible. Mr. Hilton's first venture into the hotel business that featured several hotels in Cisco, Mineral Wells, El Paso, and Marlin were not successful and Mr. Hilton sold those hotels in the 1930s. The Marlin Hilton was bought and later known as the Falls Hotel. It has been closed since the early 1960s as a hotel but parts of the first floor have held small businesses-beauty shops, an optometrist's office, an insurance agency, and restaurants. One such restaurant, the Cactus, occupied its space for about ten years until about 2016.  For many years the first floor ballroom also featured class reunions and school dances as well as public outside auction house usages. None of those businesses occupy the hotel at present. The hotel structure still stands but is unoccupied. In recent years sporadic renovations have occurred.\n\nAlong with the decline of the hot mineral water industry after World War II and the advent of penicillin, many of the bathhouse-related businesses closed and those older structures were gradually demolished or reconfigured. Most of the remnants of the bath house businesses had closed by the late 1960s. In the early 1980s a short-lived revival with some new bathing structures not did succeed nor did one other attempt at that industry's revitalization in that 1990s. Only the Buie-Allen Hospital (c. 1915) and a very few former boarding houses remain as apartments, as well as some of the intact late-19th century commercial district and numerous early 20th century residences constructed by doctors and many others who served the bath house clientele. Hot mineral water can still sometimes be obtained from a fountain outside the Marlin Chamber of Commerce in the 1929 pavilion when the city bothers to maintain that access. The former location of the one of the several bath houses, the Sanitarium Bath House (burned down by accidental arson), is now a small city park featuring a gazebo that is adjacent to the old Houston & Texas Central railroad tracks and is currently owned by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. The waters remain and there are at least three wells still active but are not accessible. The local three story Falls Community Hospital, as of the 1980s, has heated its structure via the mineral water.\nThere is an very active Falls County Historical Commission with an extensive museum and a lively theater group, The Palace Theatre, that features plays and dinner-house productions as well as occasional outside professional entertainment.\n\n=== Marlin as a Baseball Spring Training Site (1904-1918) ===\nMarlin's mild climate, hot mineral water baths and proximity by train to Dallas, Houston and San Antonio made it an appealing [[spring training]] location for [[Major League Baseball]] teams.  Four different teams trained in Marlin from 1904 to 1918: the Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants.  Players stayed at the Arlington Hotel, which is no longer standing.\n\n==== Chicago White Sox (1904) ====\nThe [[Chicago White Sox]] baseball team visited \"Marlin Springs\" from March 7 to March 17, 1904 as part of their [[spring training]] tour of the South.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/323092529/|title=White Sox to Train in South|last=|first=|date=25 January 1904|work=Topeka State Journal|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>  The team's selection of Marlin can be credited to [[Ted Sullivan (baseball)|Ted Sullivan]]. The ''Chicago Tribune'' quoted Sullivan in an article published on February 7, 1904: \"If I had looked the United States over for a spring training ground for a ball club, I do not believe I could have found a spot I would pick ahead of Marlin Springs ... [Charles] [[Charles Comiskey|Comiskey]] asked me last December when I was coming to Texas to pick him out a place to train. I met a man in Dallas, who told me he left his crutches at Marlin; that he went there suffering with rheumatism. I took a run down to Marlin ... and I found the ideal spot for training grounds.

Automobiles, electricity, and Lone Star Gas followed shortly. By the mid-1900s, Marlin had a bottling company, stock pens, a brickyard, a turkey-processing plant (building can still be seen on Williams Street/South Business [[Texas State Highway 6|Highway 6]]), a saddlery, a water crystallization plant, and a pottery plant.\n\n===The 2000s===\nThe loss of major employers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries resulted in a loss of population and a reduction in the city's tax base. While at the census in 2000 Marlin had a population of 6,628 (a modest increase of 242 people from 1990), by 2010 the population had declined to 5,967 residents. According to the US and Texas census Marlin's largest population peaked at two times in its history, 1950 and 1980, with 7009 being its highest.\n\nFirst to change hands or close was Swift turkey processing plant. Next was Marlin Mills, a carpet manufacturing company, closed during the 1980s economic decline. A [[styrofoam]] company, open in another building in Marlin's [[industrial park]], caught fire and the remains were demolished. A dress manufacturing plant which catered to large businesses, such as the airline industry, closed. Wallace, a business form printing company employing hundreds, closed in the mid-2000s. When George W Bush came to office, he tapped Anthony Principi, who then closed about 1100 small to medium-sized VA hospitals all over the US; one of which was The Thomas T. Connally [[Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Affairs Hospital]], a five-floor building located at the corner of Ward and Virginia streets. The hospital closed in 2005, resulting in the loss of more than a hundred jobs, as the economy in Marlin continued to wane.\n\nMore recent investments include the construction of a three-floor, sixty-room [[Best Western Hotel]] on [[Texas State Highway 6|Highway 6]], at [[Farm-to-Market Road]] 147. However, plans for the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] to open a medical facility for prisoners at the former Veterans' Affairs Hospital, expected to add an additional 100 to 150 jobs to the Marlin economy, did not materialize. Funds were reallocated to renovate the TDJC hospital in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], which was badly damaged by [[Hurricane Rita]].\n\n====2011====\nThe Heart of Texas Council of Governments granted the city of Marlin $35,000 to remove fifteen dilapidated buildings and structures in the town, which included 300 tons of debris.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marlindemocrat.com/news/article_d584b7e2-3719-11e1-880c-001871e3ce6c.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120905043147/http://www.marlindemocrat.com/news/article_d584b7e2-3719-11e1-880c-001871e3ce6c.html|url-status=dead|title=City manager discusses Marlin's progress in 2011 - The Marlin Democrat: News|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019|archive-date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Over {{convert|6|mi|0}} of water lines were constructed on 20 streets in 2011.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The city also started and completed a 500,000-gallon water tower project.\n\nIn 2011, the city brought back its Annual Music and Blues Festival, and raised money to revamp the city baseball fields and revive the City [[Little League]], which attracted 160 children that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kwtx.com/ourtown/headlines/Marlin_Blues_Festival_Returns_After_Five-Year_Hiatus_121673189.html?storySection=story|title=Marlin Blues Festival Returns After Five-Year Hiatus|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marlindemocrat.com/sports/article_a9d39b58-6637-11e0-b931-001cc4c002e0.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130128090231/http://www.marlindemocrat.com/sports/article_a9d39b58-6637-11e0-b931-001cc4c002e0.html?mode=story|url-status=dead|title=Season opens for Marlin Little League - The Marlin Democrat: Sports|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019|archive-date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe city's [[crime rate]] decreased by 45 percent in 2011.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====2015====\n\nOn November 10, 2015, Marlin Chief of Police Darrell Allen died while in office.

It was determined that even after the city and the state had extensively renovated the water treatment system, the man who had worked for the city as the water systems manager instead of calling for repairs cut wires when alarms sounded instead of fixing the problem. The state found those dismantlings and disengaging of the systems when they removed panels to determine the problems.

[[Falls County, Texas|Falls County]], [[Texas]], United States. The population was 6,628 at the 2000 census but decreased by 10% to 5,967 in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasalmanac.com/texas-towns/marlin|title=MARLIN &#124; Texas Almanac|date=Nov 22, 2010|website=texasalmanac.com|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019}}</ref> Since 1851, it has been the [[county seat]] of Falls County. Marlin has been given the nickname \"the Hot Mineral Water City of Texas\". Mineral waters were found there in 1892.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and Antebellum Era (1851-1861)===\nThe city of Marlin is located {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of the [[Brazos River]], which runs through the center of the county. The low falls on the river southwest of present-day Marlin was the site of [[Sarahville de Viesca, Texas|Sarahville de Viesca]], established in 1834 by [[Sterling C. Robertson]].\n\nThe act of the state legislature creating Falls County that passed on January 28, 1850 established Viesca (renamed Fort Milam) as the county seat. Citizens petitioned to choose their own location and a vote was held on January 21, 1851 that established the county seat at Adams, near the home of Dr. Allensworth Adams. On March 22, 1851, the Falls County commissioners court voted to rename Adams the \"Town of Marlin\" to honor former Robertson County alcalde [[John Marlin (Texas)|John Marlin]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe new town of Marlin was laid out around a courthouse square and a log courthouse was constructed which also served as a school and church. In 1854 a new courthouse was constructed for $5,000, painted white with dark green shutters and a chrome yellow door.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1859, the population of Marlin was 2,875 whites; 1,225 slaves; 9 free blacks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Early Schools ===\nThe first schools in Falls County were private schools established at Marlin. A tuition school, Marlin Male and Female Academy, was located on Ward Street in 1871, north of the courthouse square. The school was renamed and relocated before finally being sold in 1886, only to be destroyed by fire in 1900. A new public brick school was constructed in 1903 and a high school was completed in 1917. The [[Marlin Independent School District]] was established in 1923. Nearly half a century before in 1875, two other schools for African Americans were organized. The two black schools were dependent on state funds, and met in the African and Baptist churches. In 1916, the city council voted to build a school for blacks; later, the Booker T. Washington High School was constructed in 1951 on Commerce Street and designed by the architectural firm of Thomas, Jameson and Merrill.  This school remains standing but is vacant. The two school districts merged in 1968 into the Marlin Independent School District. In 1900, the town's Jewish residents organized a [[Sunday school]].<ref>[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/marlin.html \"Marlin, Texas\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616174617/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/marlin.html |date=2012-06-16 }}, found in the [http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/index.html Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities],</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) ===\nThe town of Marlin was formally incorporated by the state legislature on January 12, 1867. Two former slaves served as elected or appointed officials in Marlin: Nelson Denson and Lige Moore.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Houston and Texas Central Railway|Houston & Texas Central Railway]] reached Marlin on 1871 as a stop on the \"Waco Tap\" line that extended northwest from [[Bremond, Texas|Bremond]] (Robertson County) to Waco.  The location of the depot on the eastern side of the town led to the development of a commercial district eastward from the courthouse square along Live Oak Street.\n\nIn 1875, the 1854 courthouse burned and a new brick courthouse was constructed. The courthouse was badly damaged in a storm in 1886 and replaced with a new structure designed by architect [[Eugene T. Heiner]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== The Mineral Water Era (1890s-1960s) ===\nIn 1891, the City of Marlin issued bonds worth $25,000 to drill an [[artesian well]].  Hot mineral water was accidentally discovered and later found to have medicinal properties. To harness the potential benefit of these \"healing waters,\" the first bath house was constructed in 1895 with several others to follow. A least two of those early houses had large swimming pools with ornate covered buildings. Other bath houses were subsequently  constructed that included individual bathing areas with marble tubs, and cooling rooms with available massages for a full spa treatment. Thousands were soon attracted to Marlin to \"take the cure.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile Marlin had a number of small hotels in the 19th century, the construction of the three-story Arlington Hotel in 1895 demonstrated the economic impact and potential of the mineral water industry.  The hotel and adjacent bathhouse burned in January 1899 but were both replaced with more elaborate structures that opened in 1901.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Marlin 1851-1976|last=Marlin Bicentennial Heritage Committee|publisher=Marlin Chamber of Commerce|year=1976|isbn=|location=Waco, Texas|pages=17}}</ref>  The new Arlington Hotel hosted notable community events, and statewide conventions. Other than the Hilton and the numerous boarding houses (such as Captain Bourrupt\u2019s and the Harris Houses) there were several other hotels, among them the Fannin, the Majestic and the Imperial, all on Coleman Street and within a few blocks of the public hot water fountain and the mineral water wells - on a sort of bath house row.\n\nIn 1929, [[Conrad Hilton]] began construction of a [[Hilton Hotel]] that was opened on May 27, 1930 at a cost of $375,000 and to which Marlin citizens and businesses contributed $50,000.<ref name=\":0\" />  The nine-floor, 110-room hotel remains the tallest building in Marlin and was built on Coleman Street across from the Marlin Sanitarium Bathhouse which burned in the early 1990s. The hotel was connected to the bathhouse by a tunnel that has NOT been filled in but is inaccessible. Mr. Hilton\u2019s first venture into the hotel business that featured several hotels in Cisco, Mineral Wells, El Paso, and Marlin were not successful and Mr. Hilton sold those hotels in the 1930s. The Marlin Hilton was bought and later known as the Falls Hotel. It has been closed since the early 1960s as a hotel but parts of the first floor have held small businesses-beauty shops, an optometrist\u2019s office, an insurance agency, and restaurants. One such restaurant, the Cactus, occupied its space for about ten years until about 2016.  For many years the first floor ballroom also featured class reunions and school dances as well as public outside auction house usages. None of those businesses occupy the hotel at present. The hotel structure still stands but is unoccupied. In recent years sporadic renovations have occurred.\n\nAlong with the decline of the hot mineral water industry after World War II and the advent of penicillin, many of the bathhouse-related businesses closed and those older structures were gradually demolished or reconfigured. Most of the remnants of the bath house businesses had closed by the late 1960s. In the early 1980s a short-lived revival with some new bathing structures not did succeed nor did one other attempt at that industry\u2019s revitalization in that 1990s. Only the Buie-Allen Hospital (c. 1915) and a very few former boarding houses remain as apartments, as well as some of the intact late-19th century commercial district and numerous early 20th century residences constructed by doctors and many others who served the bath house clientele. Hot mineral water can still sometimes be obtained from a fountain outside the Marlin Chamber of Commerce in the 1929 pavilion when the city bothers to maintain that access. The former location of the one of the several bath houses, the Sanitarium Bath House (burned down by accidental arson), is now a small city park featuring a gazebo that is adjacent to the old Houston & Texas Central railroad tracks and is currently owned by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. The waters remain and there are at least three wells still active but are not accessible. The local three story Falls Community Hospital, as of the 1980s, has heated its structure via the mineral water.\nThere is an very active Falls County Historical Commission with an extensive museum and a lively theater group, The Palace Theatre, that features plays and dinner-house productions as well as occasional outside professional entertainment.\n\n=== Marlin as a Baseball Spring Training Site (1904-1918) ===\nMarlin's mild climate, hot mineral water baths and proximity by train to Dallas, Houston and San Antonio made it an appealing [[spring training]] location for [[Major League Baseball]] teams.  Four different teams trained in Marlin from 1904 to 1918: the Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants.  Players stayed at the Arlington Hotel, which is no longer standing.\n\n==== Chicago White Sox (1904) ====\nThe [[Chicago White Sox]] baseball team visited \"Marlin Springs\" from March 7 to March 17, 1904 as part of their [[spring training]] tour of the South.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/323092529/|title=White Sox to Train in South|last=|first=|date=25 January 1904|work=Topeka State Journal|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>  The team's selection of Marlin can be credited to [[Ted Sullivan (baseball)|Ted Sullivan]]. The ''Chicago Tribune'' quoted Sullivan in an article published on February 7, 1904: \"If I had looked the United States over for a spring training ground for a ball club, I do not believe I could have found a spot I would pick ahead of Marlin Springs ... [Charles] [[Charles Comiskey|Comiskey]] asked me last December when I was coming to Texas to pick him out a place to train. I met a man in Dallas, who told me he left his crutches at Marlin; that he went there suffering with rheumatism. I took a run down to Marlin ... and I found the ideal spot for training grounds. The place has a magnificent hotel. Adjoining this place is a beautiful natatorium equipped with hot sulphur and all kinds of baths... The ball grounds here are on even surface and are only four blocks from the hotel. This is the spot I selected for the Chicago American league club...\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/350238009/|title=Praises White Stocking Camp|last=|first=|date=7 February 1904|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>  The White Sox left Marlin on March 17 \"with expressions of regret and of hope that its individuals will be with the White Sox next spring when they return here for a similar stay.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/350224895|title=White Sox Break Camp|last=|first=|date=20 March 1904|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> Among those on the White Sox who trained in Marlin was [[George Davis (baseball)|George Davis]].

As a result, the Chicago White Sox chose to train in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/323080941|title=White Sox to New Orleans|last=|first=|date=2 January 1905|work=Topeka (Kansas) State Journal|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>  The Cardinals arrived in Marlin on March 6, 1905 and \"a large gathering of local fans [were] on hand to welcome the big leaguers.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/138867024|title=Cardinals Ready to Begin Practice|last=|first=|date=6 March 1905|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> Visits to the hot mineral water baths were a part of the team's daily routine.

Automobiles, electricity, and Lone Star Gas followed shortly. By the mid-1900s, Marlin had a bottling company, stock pens, a brickyard, a turkey-processing plant (building can still be seen on Williams Street/South Business [[Texas State Highway 6|Highway 6]]), a saddlery, a water crystallization plant, and a pottery plant.\n\n===The 2000s===\nThe loss of major employers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries resulted in a loss of population and a reduction in the city's tax base. While at the census in 2000 Marlin had a population of 6,628 (a modest increase of 242 people from 1990), by 2010 the population had declined to 5,967 residents. According to the US and Texas census Marlin\u2019s largest population peaked at two times in its history, 1950 and 1980, with 7009 being its highest.\n\nFirst to change hands or close was Swift turkey processing plant. Next was Marlin Mills, a carpet manufacturing company, closed during the 1980s economic decline. A [[styrofoam]] company, open in another building in Marlin's [[industrial park]], caught fire and the remains were demolished. A dress manufacturing plant which catered to large businesses, such as the airline industry, closed. Wallace, a business form printing company employing hundreds, closed in the mid-2000s. When George W Bush came to office, he tapped Anthony Principi, who then closed about 1100 small to medium-sized VA hospitals all over the US; one of which was The Thomas T. Connally [[Veterans Health Administration|Veterans Affairs Hospital]], a five-floor building located at the corner of Ward and Virginia streets. The hospital closed in 2005, resulting in the loss of more than a hundred jobs, as the economy in Marlin continued to wane.\n\nMore recent investments include the construction of a three-floor, sixty-room [[Best Western Hotel]] on [[Texas State Highway 6|Highway 6]], at [[Farm-to-Market Road]] 147. However, plans for the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] to open a medical facility for prisoners at the former Veterans' Affairs Hospital, expected to add an additional 100 to 150 jobs to the Marlin economy, did not materialize. Funds were reallocated to renovate the TDJC hospital in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], which was badly damaged by [[Hurricane Rita]].\n\n====2011====\nThe Heart of Texas Council of Governments granted the city of Marlin $35,000 to remove fifteen dilapidated buildings and structures in the town, which included 300 tons of debris.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.marlindemocrat.com/news/article_d584b7e2-3719-11e1-880c-001871e3ce6c.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120905043147/http://www.marlindemocrat.com/news/article_d584b7e2-3719-11e1-880c-001871e3ce6c.html|url-status=dead|title=City manager discusses Marlin's progress in 2011 - The Marlin Democrat: News|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019|archive-date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Over {{convert|6|mi|0}} of water lines were constructed on 20 streets in 2011.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The city also started and completed a 500,000-gallon water tower project.\n\nIn 2011, the city brought back its Annual Music and Blues Festival, and raised money to revamp the city baseball fields and revive the City [[Little League]], which attracted 160 children that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kwtx.com/ourtown/headlines/Marlin_Blues_Festival_Returns_After_Five-Year_Hiatus_121673189.html?storySection=story|title=Marlin Blues Festival Returns After Five-Year Hiatus|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marlindemocrat.com/sports/article_a9d39b58-6637-11e0-b931-001cc4c002e0.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130128090231/http://www.marlindemocrat.com/sports/article_a9d39b58-6637-11e0-b931-001cc4c002e0.html?mode=story|url-status=dead|title=Season opens for Marlin Little League - The Marlin Democrat: Sports|accessdate=Aug 18, 2019|archive-date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe city's [[crime rate]] decreased by 45 percent in 2011.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====2015====\n\nOn November 10, 2015, Marlin Chief of Police Darrell Allen died while in office.

It was determined that even after the city and the state had extensively renovated the water treatment system, the man who had worked for the city as the water systems manager instead of calling for repairs cut wires when alarms sounded instead of fixing the problem. The state found those dismantlings and disengaging of the systems when they removed panels to determine the problems.

After countless ages of geologic swamps, marshes and sloughs, the prairies dominated the landscape with groves of trees, flowers, and wildlife in abundance.\n\nMarkham, southwest of the southern tip of [[Lake Michigan]], had been a crossroad for early pioneers. In 1816 a treaty was made with the [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe people|Chippewa]] and [[Potawatomi]] tribes which ceded a corridor of land located between a point north of the [[Chicago River]] and the mouth of the [[Calumet River]] to the settlers. The southern boundary, one of two Indian Treaty Boundary Lines, was surveyed along a line from the [[Kankakee River]] to Lake Michigan.  The line still appears on government maps and now includes a short portion of [[Interstate 57]] near the [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] interchange northwest of Markham.\n\nThe village of Markham was incorporated in 1925 with a population under 300. The village was named for Charles H. Markham, president of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] 1911\u20131918, 1919\u20131926. In the mid-1930s, the Croissant Park subdivision was built and increased the population from 349 to 1,388. After World War II, Markham's population doubled to 2,753 residents by 1950. The village developed into a [[bedroom community]] as residents sought homes, not industry. An airport developed at 165th Street and Kedzie Avenue was the nearest field outside of Chicago. The airport site was located near what is now the Cook County Sixth Circuit Courthouse. On August 24, 1967, Markham was incorporated as a city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn 2017, [[Roger Agpawa]] was elected [[mayor]].<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/convicted-felon-roger-agpawa-wins-election-as-mayor-of-markham-illinois/</ref>  He had previously served as [[fire chief]] in neighboring [[Country Club Hills, Illinois|Country Club Hills]].

He brought with him six seedlings from the [[Black Forest]] of [[Germany]] and planted them along the Indian Boundary Line. This \"Lone Pine Tree\" was adopted as the official city symbol in 1985. The lone survivor of six pine trees brought from the Black Forest in 1860 died in 1986. The Markham City Council appropriated money to get a replacement tree from the Black Forest, which the Markham Garden Club planted that year.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 349\n|1940= 1288\n|1950= 2783\n|1960= 11704\n|1970= 15987\n|1980= 15534\n|1990= 13136\n|2000= 12620\n|2010= 12508\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=12418\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 7, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]],<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> there were 12,620 people, 3,842 households, and 3,119 families residing in the city.

After countless ages of geologic swamps, marshes and sloughs, the prairies dominated the landscape with groves of trees, flowers, and wildlife in abundance.\n\nMarkham, southwest of the southern tip of [[Lake Michigan]], had been a crossroad for early pioneers. In 1816 a treaty was made with the [[Odawa people|Ottawa]], [[Ojibwe people|Chippewa]] and [[Potawatomi]] tribes which ceded a corridor of land located between a point north of the [[Chicago River]] and the mouth of the [[Calumet River]] to the settlers. The southern boundary, one of two Indian Treaty Boundary Lines, was surveyed along a line from the [[Kankakee River]] to Lake Michigan.  The line still appears on government maps and now includes a short portion of [[Interstate 57]] near the [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] interchange northwest of Markham.\n\nThe village of Markham was incorporated in 1925 with a population under 300. The village was named for Charles H. Markham, president of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] 1911-1918, 1919-1926. In the mid-1930s, the Croissant Park subdivision was built and increased the population from 349 to 1,388. After World War II, Markham's population doubled to 2,753 residents by 1950. The village developed into a [[bedroom community]] as residents sought homes, not industry. An airport developed at 165th Street and Kedzie Avenue was the nearest field outside of Chicago. The airport site was located near what is now the Cook County Sixth Circuit Courthouse. On August 24, 1967, Markham was incorporated as a city.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn 2017, [[Roger Agpawa]] was elected [[mayor]].<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/convicted-felon-roger-agpawa-wins-election-as-mayor-of-markham-illinois/</ref>  He had previously served as [[fire chief]] in neighboring [[Country Club Hills, Illinois|Country Club Hills]].
