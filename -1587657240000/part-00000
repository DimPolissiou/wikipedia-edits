However, the suitability of a PDF file for archival preservation depends on options chosen when the PDF is created: most notably, whether to embed the necessary fonts for rendering the document; whether to use encryption; and whether to preserve additional information from the original document beyond what is needed to print it.\n\nPDF/A was originally a new joint activity between the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies ([[NPES]]) and the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] to develop an international standard defining the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for archiving documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/a-short-history-of-pdfa/ |title=A short history of PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> The goal was to address the growing need to electronically archive documents in a way that would ensure preservation of their contents over an extended period of time and ensure that those documents would be able to be retrieved and rendered with a consistent and predictable result in the future.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/the-most-important-reasons-to-use-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=The most important reasons to use PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> This need exists in a wide variety of government, industry and academic areas worldwide, including legal systems, libraries, newspapers, and regulated industries.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/typical-uses-for-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=Typical uses for PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe PDF/A standard does not define an archiving strategy or the goals of an archiving system. It identifies a \"profile\" for electronic documents that ensures the documents can be reproduced exactly the same way using various software in years to come. A key element to this reproducibility is the requirement for PDF/A documents to be 100% self-contained. All of the information necessary for displaying the document in the same manner is embedded in the file. This includes, but is not limited to, all content (text, raster images and vector graphics), fonts, and color information. A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and data streams), but may include annotations (e.g. hypertext links) that link to external documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |title=The technical side of the PDF/A standard |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2017-08-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702191437/http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nOther key elements to PDF/A conformance include:<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045349/http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"pdfa2-press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/07/pdfa-2-standard-published-by-iso-the-new-standard-includes-great-technical-enhancements-free-informative-webinar-to-be-scheduled/ |title=PDF/A-2 Standard Published by ISO!

PDF/A-1 files will not necessarily conform to PDF/A-2, and PDF/A-2 compliant files will not necessarily conform to PDF/A-1.\n\nPart 2 of the PDF/A Standard is based on a PDF 1.7 (ISO 32000-1), rather than PDF 1.4 and offers a number of new features:\n* [[JPEG 2000]] image compression\n* support for transparency effects and layers\n* embedding of [[OpenType]] fonts\n* provisions for digital signatures in accordance with the PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures \u2013 PAdES standard\n* the option of embedding PDF/A files to facilitate archiving of sets of documents with a single file.<ref name=\"pdfa2-press\" />\n\nPart 2 defines three conformance levels.

The Phase 3 testing and acceptance period concluded in July, 2017. veraPDF now covers all parts (1, 2 and 3) and conformance levels (a, b, u) of PDF/A.\n\nveraPDF is available for installation on Windows, macOS, or Linux using a PDFBox-based or \"Greenfields\" PDF parser.<ref name=\"verapdf-website\">\n{{cite web\n | title = Software\n | date = 30 June 2015\n | work = veraPDF\n | url = http://verapdf.org/software/\n | access-date = 2017-03-15\n}}  Page for downloading the platform-specific installer.\n</ref>\n\n== PDF/A viewers ==\nThe PDF/A specification also states some requirements for a conforming PDF/A viewer, which must\n* ignore any data that are not described by the PDF and PDF/A standards;\n* ignore any linearization information provided by the file;\n* only use the embedded fonts (rather than any locally available, substituted or simulated fonts);\n* only display using the embedded colour profile;\n* ensure that form fields do not change the rendered presentation and are rendered without regard to the form data;\n* ensure that annotations are rendered consistently.\n\nWhen encountering a file that claims conformance with PDF/A, some PDF viewers will default to a special \"PDF/A viewing mode\" to fulfill conforming reader requirements. To take one example, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 include an alert to advise the user that PDF/A viewing mode has been activated. Some PDF viewers allow users to disable the PDF/A viewing mode or to remove the PDF/A information from a file.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2011/05/how-to-remove-pdfa-information-from-a-file/ |title=How to Remove PDF/A Information from a file |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/standard/using/WSe6c6ee3e336ebb13-630c189912be99aedab-7fff.html#WS3E0E8467-B787-4020-A1D3-6BC762A42DF2.w |title=Change the PDF/A viewing mode |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nA PDF/A document must embed all fonts in use; accordingly, a PDF/A file will often be larger than an equivalent PDF file that does not include embedded fonts.\n\nThe use of transparency is forbidden in PDF/A-1. The majority of PDF generation tools that allow for PDF/A document compliance, such as the PDF export in OpenOffice.org or PDF export tool in Microsoft Office 2007 suites, will also make any transparent images in a given document non-transparent. That restriction was removed in PDF/A-2.<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\" />\n\nSome archivists have voiced concerns that PDF/A-3, which allows arbitrary files to be embedded in PDF/A documents, could result in circumvention of memory institution procedures and restrictions on archived formats.<ref>{{citation |url=http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/28/archivists-no-flowers-for-pdfa-3/ |title=Archivists: No flowers for PDF/A-3 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe PDF Association had addressed various misconceptions<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pdfa.org/the-myths-and-legends-surrounding-pdfa/ |title=The myths and legends surrounding PDF/A |accessdate=2018-02-15}}</ref> regarding PDF/A in its publication \"PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/|title=PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0}}</ref>\n\nConverting a PDF (up to version 1.4) into a PDF/A-2 usually works as expected, except for problems with [[glyph]]s. According to the PDF Association, \"Problems can occur before and/or during the generation of PDFs. A PDF/A file can be formally correct yet still have incorrect glyphs. Only a careful visual check can uncover this problem. Because generation problems also affect Unicode mapping, the problem attracts the attention when a visual check is carried out on the extracted text.\nIn PDF/A, text/font usage is specified uniquely enough to ensure that it cannot be incorrect.\nIf viewers or printers do not offer complete support for encoding systems, this can result in problems with regard to PDF/A.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/pdfa-%E2%80%93-a-look-at-the-technical-side/ |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref> Meaning that for a document to be completely compliant with the standard, it will be correct internally, while the system used for viewing or printing the document may produce undesired results.\n\nA document produced with [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) conversion into PDF/A-2 or PDF/A-3 doesn't support the <code>notdefglyph</code> flag. Therefore, this type of conversion can result in unrendered content.\n\nWhen documents are converted to PDF/A visual inspection is needed since errors in the visual content are common. In a test sample 11 percent of the produced PDF/A-1b document contained visual artefacts.

However, the suitability of a PDF file for archival preservation depends on options chosen when the PDF is created: most notably, whether to embed the necessary fonts for rendering the document; whether to use encryption; and whether to preserve additional information from the original document beyond what is needed to print it.\n\nPDF/A was originally a new joint activity between the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies ([[NPES]]) and the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] to develop an international standard defining the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for archiving documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/a-short-history-of-pdfa/ |title=A short history of PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> The goal was to address the growing need to electronically archive documents in a way that would ensure preservation of their contents over an extended period of time and ensure that those documents would be able to be retrieved and rendered with a consistent and predictable result in the future.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/the-most-important-reasons-to-use-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=The most important reasons to use PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> This need exists in a wide variety of government, industry and academic areas worldwide, including legal systems, libraries, newspapers, and regulated industries.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/typical-uses-for-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=Typical uses for PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe PDF/A standard does not define an archiving strategy or the goals of an archiving system. It identifies a \"profile\" for electronic documents that ensures the documents can be reproduced exactly the same way using various software in years to come. A key element to this reproducibility is the requirement for PDF/A documents to be 100% self-contained. All of the information necessary for displaying the document in the same manner is embedded in the file. This includes, but is not limited to, all content (text, raster images and vector graphics), fonts, and color information. A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and data streams), but may include annotations (e.g. hypertext links) that link to external documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |title=The technical side of the PDF/A standard |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2017-08-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702191437/http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nOther key elements to PDF/A conformance include:<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045349/http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"pdfa2-press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/07/pdfa-2-standard-published-by-iso-the-new-standard-includes-great-technical-enhancements-free-informative-webinar-to-be-scheduled/ |title=PDF/A-2 Standard Published by ISO!

To take one example, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 include an alert to advise the user that PDF/A viewing mode has been activated. Some PDF viewers allow users to disable the PDF/A viewing mode or to remove the PDF/A information from a file.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2011/05/how-to-remove-pdfa-information-from-a-file/ |title=How to Remove PDF/A Information from a file |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/standard/using/WSe6c6ee3e336ebb13-630c189912be99aedab-7fff.html#WS3E0E8467-B787-4020-A1D3-6BC762A42DF2.w |title=Change the PDF/A viewing mode |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nA PDF/A document must embed all fonts in use; accordingly, a PDF/A file will often be larger than an equivalent PDF file that does not include embedded fonts.\n\nThe use of transparency is forbidden in PDF/A-1. The majority of PDF generation tools that allow for PDF/A document compliance, such as the PDF export in OpenOffice.org or PDF export tool in Microsoft Office 2007 suites, will also make any transparent images in a given document non-transparent. That restriction was removed in PDF/A-2.<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\" />\n\nSome archivists have voiced concerns that PDF/A-3, which allows arbitrary files to be embedded in PDF/A documents, could result in circumvention of memory institution procedures and restrictions on archived formats.<ref>{{citation |url=http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/28/archivists-no-flowers-for-pdfa-3/ |title=Archivists: No flowers for PDF/A-3 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe PDF Association had addressed various misconceptions<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pdfa.org/the-myths-and-legends-surrounding-pdfa/ |title=The myths and legends surrounding PDF/A |accessdate=2018-02-15}}</ref> regarding PDF/A in its publication \"PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/|title=PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0}}</ref>\n\nConverting a PDF (up to version 1.4) into a PDF/A-2 usually works as expected, except for problems with [[glyph]]s. According to the PDF Association, \"Problems can occur before and/or during the generation of PDFs. A PDF/A file can be formally correct yet still have incorrect glyphs. Only a careful visual check can uncover this problem. Because generation problems also affect Unicode mapping, the problem attracts the attention when a visual check is carried out on the extracted text.\nIn PDF/A, text/font usage is specified uniquely enough to ensure that it cannot be incorrect.\nIf viewers or printers do not offer complete support for encoding systems, this can result in problems with regard to PDF/A.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/pdfa-%E2%80%93-a-look-at-the-technical-side/ |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref> Meaning that for a document to be completely compliant with the standard, it will be correct internally, while the system used for viewing or printing the document may produce undesired results.\n\nA document produced with [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) conversion into PDF/A-2 or PDF/A-3 doesn't support the <code>notdefglyph</code> flag.

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics. Although Phoenix's performance, the musical score, and the cinematography were praised, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success and set records for an October release. It grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]]. Phoenix and Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also won at the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award]] ceremonies.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should generally be no more than 700 words. The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to applause, but starts telling morbid jokes, confesses to the train murders, and rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]. When Murray criticizes him, Arthur begins acting more erratically. To everyone's shock Arthur murders him and is arrested as riots break out across Gotham. <!--DO NOT LINK TO JOE CHILL, HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVIE-->One rioter<!--DO NOT LINK TO JOE CHILL, HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVIE--> corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], sparing Bruce.{{efn|Identified off-screen as the [[origin of Batman]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Russel |first1=Bradley |title=Joker ending explained: your biggest questions answered |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-ending-explained/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=October 5, 2019 |date=October 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004233012/https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-ending-explained/ |archive-date=October 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he dances to the cheers of the crowd.\n\nAt Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand it.

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success and set records for an October release. It grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]]. Phoenix and Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also won at the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award]] ceremonies.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should generally be no more than 700 words. The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery.

{"title_page": "Silvino Barsana Agudo", "text_new": "Attorney '''Silvino Barsana Agudo''' (also known as S.B. or Binong) was most notably the former Governor of [[Batanes]] Province (1968\u20131971) in the [[Philippines]]. He was also businessman, lawyer, World War II veteran, and public servant.\n\n==Origin: Agudo family name==\nThe Agudo last name is traced back to \u201cTuvid du Materam\u201d of [[Ivana, Batanes|Ivana]], [[Batanes]] in 1751. When the Spanish missionaries observed that people had no formal name upon arrival to Batanes, the missionaries assigned names. Through the help of an interpreter, the Spanish asked, \u201cWho is the leader of this village?\u201d The leader of the Ivana village was \u201cTuvid du Materam.\u201d In Ivatan, \u201cTuvid\u201d means one who knows all things \u2013 like when it is the right time to fish, when to plant camote and other crops, and assist in giving birth. This is why \u201cTuvid\u201d was leader of his village. They called him \u201cdu Materam\u201d because he lived at the foot of the mountain called [http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2008/04/mt-matarem-473.html Mt. Materam]. The mountain was called \u201cMateram\u201d because it means sharp in Ivatan and the mountain looks like the sharp edge of a bolo.  It was because \u201cTuvid\u201d knew everything and seemed to be sharp and because he lived at the edge of a sharp mountain the Spaniards rightfully gave the family name \u201cAgudo\u201d, which means sharp and bright in Spanish.\n\nThe Spaniards then told \u201cTuvid\u201d the story of Jesus. \u201cTuvid\u201d was pleased with the story and advised all the villagers to be hear the story as well. The village followed their leader, \u201cTuvid,\u201d and found the Spaniards warm and interesting and agreed to be baptized in 1773.  \u201cTuvid\u201d was given the first name Eugenio, so thus his name was Eugenio Agudo. Eugenio had one son. The Spanish chose to give his son the name Jose after St. Joseph, the patron saint of Ivana, because the Spanish were so pleased with Eugenio\u2019s assistance and compliance. This is how the Agudo name was born (the story of Tuvid  provided by former Batanes Gov. Silvino B. Agudo).\n\n== Silvino's early years==\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo was born on September 12, 1917, in the northern mainland provincial city of [[Tuguegarao]], [[Cagayan]], [[Philippines]]. Silvino was the second of six children of Pablo Agudo, a farmer turned tailor, and Consolacion Castillejos Barsana, a pre-school teacher, both natives of [[Ivana, Batanes|Ivana]], [[Batanes]].\n\nSiblings:\n\n1. VICENTE HOMOBONO AGUDO (born November 14, 1907; married Benjamina Pango of Ivana, they had 1 son, Vicente Jr.)\n\n2. AURORA ELISA AGUDO (born April 22, 1915; died single and childless in 1949)\n\n3. '''SILVINO ARTENIO AGUDO''' (born September 12, 1917; married Honorata P. Arcilla, they had 7 children)\n\n4. ROBUSTIANO FEDERICO AGUDO (born October 12, 1920; married Teodora \"Dory\" Villapando, they had 8 children)\n\n5. RAMON AGUDO (born September 2, 1922; died single and childless in 1954)\n\n6. DAZ AGUDO (born 1923 and died at the age of 5 due to the flu, trancaso)\n\n7. SOCCORRO \"CORRING\" Agudo (born in 1925, married to Atty. and later Judge Deogracias Aggabao; they had three children. She died in 1960)\n\nSilvino's parents moved to mainland [[Luzon]] because \"farming (in [[Batanes]]) could not support the local population.\" Consequently, Silvino's father, Pablo, moved to Cagayan province and established a tailor shop in [[Tuguegarao]], [[Cagayan]], the capital of the province. His father's prospering business provided the opportunity for short vacations back to [[Ivana, Batanes|Ivana]], [[Batanes]].\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo's mother, Consolacion Castillejos Barsana, was born December 27, 1882 in [[Ivana, Batanes|Ivana]], [[Batanes]]. Consolacion was a pre-school teacher by profession and her father, Luciano Barsana, served as Governor of [[Batanes]].\n\nSilvino cared for his mother who suffered for tuberculosis. However, Silvino's mother died on May 7, 1930, in [[Tuguegarao]], [[Cagayan]], when Silvino Barsana Agudo was 13.\n\n==Education==\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo graduated from [[Cagayan National High School]] in [[Tuguegarao]], [[Cagayan]] in March 1935. Immediately, after high school graduation Silvino's father made arrangements for him to go to Manila to pursue further studies. That was the last time Silvino saw his father; barely six months later, Silvino's father likewise died.\n\nSilvino Agudo graduated with a bachelor's degree in Commerce (which is now Business) with a major in Accounting from the [[University of Santo Tomas|University of Santo Tomas School]]. Silvino passed the Certified Public Accountant Exam (CPA) the following year.  Silvino also graduated from [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|University of Santo Tomas University Civil Law]] in 1941 and passed the Bar of the Philippines in December 2, 1941, at 27 years of age.<ref name=Online>{{cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/baradmission/lawlist/a.php|publisher=Supreme Court of the Philippines|title=Law List - A|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n\n\n==Entry of Japanese into the Philippines and Batanes==\n\nEarly on December 8, 1941, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was in the municipality of Santa Cruz, Laguna for a court hearing regarding a boundary dispute.  While waiting for the judge at 8:00 am for trial proceeding, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was informed that the judge was not coming anymore to the proceeding because the Japanese had bombarded Clark Field and Pearl Harbor.  After 9:00 am, as Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo left court and was on his way back to Manila, he noticed that every corner of Santa Cruz had posts to recruit for volunteers to join the Philippine Armed Forces to stop the Japanese forces who were coming in from the northern city of Ligayen, [[Pangasinan]] and [[Tayabas]], [[Quezon]] in the southern [[Luzon]].  However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo did not focus on that and proceeded to [[Manila]], a trip that took one whole day.\n\nWhen Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived at his house in P. Campa Street along [[Espa\u00f1a Boulevard]], he found his house was filled with Ivatans.  This was because when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor many dormitories closed in Manila and Ivatan students remembered the Agudo family.  Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo generously welcomed the Ivatans and assigned the girls to the upper floor and the boys on the lower floor and the Agudo sister, Aurora, prepared food for everyone.  More Ivatans from [[Batangas]] and [[Cavite]] sought refuge at the Agudo family house.  Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo suggested for the new Ivatans who sought refuge to go to the house of Congressman Vicente Agan, Representative of Batanes; however, there was likewise no space. A messenger from Congressman Agan sent a note to the Agudo household regarding a Japanese sponsored boat that would take Ivatans back to Batanes with free passage.\n\n==Military service==\n\nDuring World War II, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was drafted into the 7th Military Police Command. Silvino Barsana Agudo received military police training in [[Cavite]], [[Rizal]], and [[Nueva Ecija]] and was told his unit was to do service in Tokyo upon the surrender of the Japanese Imperial Army. However, the trip to was rescheduled by General Douglas McAurthur because of the unconditional surrender of Japan on September 3, 1945.\n\nIn the Basco Program of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines two veterans received decoration for their service. Atty. Eliseo Reyes, who at the outbreak of the war in the Pacific was a constabulary soldier in Cebu, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. Commador Geronimo Cabal and Capt. Teofilo Vatoner, the highest officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association pinned the three medals and three ribbons on Atty. Eliseo Reyes and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo.\n\n==Marriage and family life==\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo married Honorata Arcilla civilly in May 1949 and formally through the Catholic Church on December 10, 1949.\n\n==As a lawyer==\n\nAgudo also presided as a defense lawyer in various criminal cases that made appeals in the Supreme Court of the Philippines on behalf of defendants with limited resources prosecuted for murder<ref name=\"Case 1\">{{cite web|title=THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. AQUILINO PACALA and TRANQUILINO PACALA, JR. alias CHACOY|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1974/aug1974/gr_l_26647_1974.html|publisher=Supreme Court of the Philippines|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> and rape.<ref name=\"Case 2\">{{cite web|title=THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. EDGARDO SANTOS Y BASA|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1978/oct1978/gr_41525_1978.html|publisher=The Supreme Court of the Philippines|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nSilvino Agudo's law office, Agudo, Reyes, Estrella and Associates, was located in rooms 205 - 208 0f the [[Puzon Building]] in Quezon City (1974).\n\nSilvino Agudo hired and trained a young [[Diosdado_Peralta|Diosdado Peralta]], now Chief Justice of Supreme Court under President Rodrigo Duterte, to work in his law firm. Agudo took Diosdado Peralta, a recent University of Santo Tomas law school graduate, and [https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/243235-things-to-know-supreme-court-chief-justice-diosdado-peralta assigned him to junior projects] related to Cosmos Bottling company, which Silvino helped establish. \n\n[[File:Batanes Governor Agudo.jpg|thumb|Silvino Barsana Agudo]]\n\n== Nominations for Governor of Batanes ==\n\nAs the 1967 mid-election approached President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] moved to ensure that his [[Nacionalista Party]] would be victorius by electing most of the Senators, Governors, and Mayors of the country. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] asked Chairman Manuel \"Maning\" Agudo to choose Silvino Barsana Agudo as candidate for Governor who will most likely win in [[Batanes]].  Manuel Agudo's reputation was critically important to Silvino Barsana Agudo's endorsement to run for Governor of [[Batanes]] because of his Chairmanship of the Civil Service Board of Appeals, tenure as Congressman of Batanes (1958\u20131961), and service as administrative officer in the Office of the President in [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] during the tenure of six Presidents of the Philippines, namely: [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]], [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], [[Manuel Roxas]], [[Elpidio Quirino]], [[Ramon Magsaysay]], and [[Carlos P. Garcia]].\n\nDuring this time Silvino Barsana Agudo was a successful law practitioner with many clients in the Filipino, American, Spanish, and Chinese communities. Precisely because of his success in law practice Silvino Barasana Agudo was induced to run for Governor of Batanes. Silvino Barsana Agudo agreed to participate in the Provincial Convention in Batanes and then boarded a Philippine Navy boat to [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]] in the month of August 1967.\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo's trip was delayed by a typhoon but when he arrived in [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], the town was as he described it a \"gog.\" Manuel and Renee Agudo rented a house to stay and Silvino Barsana Agudo stayed in the house of his Uncle, Jose Barona, and Auntie Bilay (Severa) Barsana Barona, sister of Silvino's mother. On the night of his arrival the Batanes Veteran Association, a Chapter of the Veterans Association of the Philippines, had a program in the High School auditorium in which Silvino Barsana Agudo was recognized as a Veteran of World War II by the highest-ranking officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association.\n\nTwo days after Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived in  [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], the Nacionalista Party Convention was held on top Tukon Hill. There was a band to render music while waiting for the delegates from each town: [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], Itbayat, [[Mahatao]], [[Uyugan]], and Sabtang. When all the delegates arrived, nominations were made and three were nominated for Governor: Jose Aceron of Ivana, Tobias Abad of Basco, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo of Ivana. After the nominations, Jose Martinez, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo's campaign manager, talked to delegates in each town without consulting Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. After the short campaigning, voting was done by secret ballot.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mrs. Renee Agudo, Chairwoman of the Batanes [[Nacionalista Party]] announced the winning party candidates:\nGovernor: Atty. Silvino B. Agudo; \nVice Governor: Tobais Abad; \nBoard Members (2): Emmanuel Aguasha of [[Mahatao]] and Francisco Bidayan of [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]]\n\nAfter the convention all the official candidates took the same Philippine Navy Boat back to Manila.\n\nMrs. Renee Agudo reported to President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and Senator [[Gil Puyat]] the official candidates for the [[Nacionalista Party]] in Batanes. Within one month President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] invited all the candidates for governor and city mayor to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] for individual conversations with the President. To everyone's surprise, President Marcos knew all candidates' names by heart. All candidates were also brought into a room filled with 6-foot piles of legal-sized brown envelopes. The President's aid gave one envelope to each candidate. However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was pulled aside and given a second envelope which was to be for the six candidates for mayor in the Province. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo took a taxi home and examined the contents of the brown envelopes \u2013 each containing US$10,000 in $10 bills or $20,000 in all. In remembrance of President, Atty, Silvino Barsana Agudo bought a new refrigerator to change the old fridge. The rest of the money was distributed and spent for provisions to the Batanes campaign.\n\n== As Governor of Batanes ==\n\n\n[[File:Batanes Governor.jpg|Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo in Provincial Governor's Office in Basco, Batanes ]]\n\n\nDuring his term (1968\u20131971), Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo supported the preservation and promotion of Batanes culture through various initiatives including research of archaic Itbayaten numeral writing systems.<ref name=Research>{{cite web|last=Yamada|first=Yukihiro|title=Speech Disguise in Itbayaten Numerals|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-10-01-1972/yamada-speech%20disguise%20itbayaten%20numerals.pdf|publisher=The University of the Philippines Diliman|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Suzuki Boys ==\n\nGovernor Silvino Agudo presided over [[Batanes]] during one of the province's most tumultuous times and played an instrumental role in preventing election fraud and protecting [[Ivatan people]] from armed thugs.\n\n\nIn less than a week after the November 11, 1969 Congressional Elections, Ivatans, the residents of Batanes, were up in arms against the takeover of their islands by gangster-rule during the elections. Reports of the terror that gripped Batanes province have filtered to Manila only several days after the elections, and there was nothing they could do to change the results. All they could do was call attention public attention to the \"rape of the ballot\" in their province. Their grievances were not the sour grapes of defeated politicians. They come from plain citizens talking not as NPs or LPs but, as outraged citizens who were robbed of their right to vote at gunpoint.\n\n\nThe takeover of the Batanes group by the thugs is a classic example of a swift coup that isolated the group from the rest of the country. It was cut off from airline flights and from telephone and telegraph communications. There were five candidates for the lone congressional seat of the province.\n\nThe important candidates were:\n\n- Mrs. Renee Agudo (NP)\n\n- former Congressmen Jorge Abad (father of [[Department of Budget and Management]] Secretary [[Florencio Abad]])\n\n- Rufino Antonio Jr. (Independent-NP)\n\nWeeks before the November 11, 1969 Elections, about 100 strange faces (non-Ivatans) landed in Basco and scattered in the six towns of the province. Crates also landed in [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]]. In late October, Provincial Commander (PC), Captain Fulgencio Albano, collected licensed firearms from the residents \"for verification.\" Provincial Command soldiers met Philippine Airline (PAL) Flights on October 26, 28 and November 2,4,and 6 to Basco to search landing passengers and their luggage for firearms.\n\nOn November 9, PAL suspended flights to Basco because of man-caused obstructions in the runway. A number of privately owned planes, including light aircraft including a helicopter and [[Douglas DC-3]] blocked Basco's runway. The PAL plane that carried Ivatan voters from Manila had to turn back.\n\nOn November 10, a day before the elections, telegraph communications from Basco through the Bureau of Telecommunications and Station and Radio Communications of the Philippines Incorporated (RCPI) subsequently went dead. Armed goons had allegedly destroyed all private and government wireless facilities and drove away operators of the telcom and RCPI stations; an operator of the weather bureau was reportedly tear gassed. The equipment was destroyed, however, some operators who fled to the mountains used a transmitter to report \"goon activities\" and request the Provincial Commander Fulgencio Albano and President Ferdinand Marcos for aid. Later during the night of November 10, the Bureau of Public Highways compound was raided and vehicles were destroyed.\n\nEven before this, on October 24, Ivatans in Manila held a meeting at D & E Restaurant in [[Quezon City]] and decided to ask Provincial Command and Comelec to relieve Captain Fulgencio Albano of Batanes Provincial Command. On November 2, Major Benjamin Amante became the new Batanes PC Commander. On November 7, Major Amante and Representative Roque Ablan (Ilocos Norte) flew to Basco in Ablan's plane. Major Amante stayed only a few days then left Basco before elections. The PC Officer in charge was Captain Velasco.\n\nOn election day November 11, 1969, the roads leading to the six towns of Batanes were barricaded by checkpoints manned by armed thugs. Governor Agudo and his party making tours of the towns were turned back at one of the checkpoints and warned if they proceeded  they might be ambushed. An American Peace Corps Volunteer, Larry Jones, was given six hours to surrender photographs of goons terrorizing voters at precincts.\n\nThree days after the elections, Batanes was one of the few provinces from which results of the congressional elections were not heard. In the past elections, which were peaceful, results were known by the next day, there being only less than 5,000 votes to count. In Manila, Governor Silvino Agudo's wife, Honorata Agudo, asked Executive Secretary [[Ernesto Maceda]] to assign security men to her house near Quezon City because suspicious looking men were loitering near their home.\n\n==Batanes Bicentennial Commission==\n\nGov. Silvino Barsana Agudo remained active in provincial affairs into his retired days as President of the Batanes Bicentennial Commission in 1983.<ref name=BatanesOnline>{{cite web|title=IVATANS TO COMMEMORATE BATANES BICENTENNIAL|url=http://www.batanesonline.com/Yesteryears/ContentsYesteryears/Bicentenial.htm|publisher=BatanesOnline|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1983, on the initiative of the Dominican Fathers in Santo Domingo Church in [[Quezon City]], a Bicentennial Commission was created to plan the celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Christianization of [[Batanes]] and establishment of a centralized civil government therein. (In 1773, two missionaries from the Dominican Order from [[Tuguegarao]], [[Cagayan]] landed in [[Ivana, Batanes]] and stayed to put up their church. Ten years later in June 1783, the Civil Government was established in [[Basco, Batanes]])\n\nThe Bicentennial Commission was composed of Ivatans from [[Manila]] environs invited by the [[Santo Domingo]] Fathers. The Fathers consulted Engineer Anastacio Agan, former Congressmen from Batanes and at that time incumbent [[Quezon City]] Engineer.  Congressmen Agan was also the structural engineer who built the Santo Domingo Church on [[Quezon Avenue]] in [[Quezon City]]. He was assisted in the job of construction of the Santo Domingo Church by Engineer Ruperto Agudo.\n\nThe assembly of Ivatans who were invited to form the Commission elected the following officers: President, Ex-Governor Silvino B. Agudo; Vice President and Chairman of the Committee on Public Information, Dr. Florentino H. Hornedo; Secretary, Fr. Alfonso Loreto, O.P.; Treasurer, Rev. Fr. Rey Adadlid, O.P.; Committee of Ways and Means: Chairman-Dr. Francisco Roman; Co-Chairman Mrs. Josefina Castro-Valera. Members were Mrs. Rucela Barsana Acacio, Mrs. Ana G. Agagan; Atty.

When the Spanish missionaries observed that people had no formal name upon arrival to Batanes, the missionaries assigned names.

A messenger from Congressman Agan sent a note to the Agudo household regarding a Japanese sponsored boat that would take Ivatans back to Batanes with free passage.\n\n==Military service==\n\nDuring World War II, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was drafted into the 7th Military Police Command. Silvino Barsana Agudo received military police training in [[Cavite]], [[Rizal]], and [[Nueva Ecija]] and was told his unit was to do service in Tokyo upon the surrender of the Japanese Imperial Army. However, the trip to was rescheduled by General Douglas McAurthur because of the unconditional surrender of Japan on September 3, 1945.\n\nIn the Basco Program of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines two veterans received decoration for their service. Atty. Eliseo Reyes, who at the outbreak of the war in the Pacific was a constabulary soldier in Cebu, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. Commador Geronimo Cabal and Capt. Teofilo Vatoner, the highest officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association pinned the three medals and three ribbons on Atty. Eliseo Reyes and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo.\n\n==Marriage and family life==\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo married Honorata Arcilla civilly in May 1949 and formally through the Catholic Church on December 10, 1949.\n\n==As a lawyer==\n\nAgudo also presided as a defense lawyer in various criminal cases that made appeals in the Supreme Court of the Philippines on behalf of defendants with limited resources prosecuted for murder<ref name=\"Case 1\">{{cite web|title=THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. AQUILINO PACALA and TRANQUILINO PACALA, JR. alias CHACOY|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1974/aug1974/gr_l_26647_1974.html|publisher=Supreme Court of the Philippines|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> and rape.<ref name=\"Case 2\">{{cite web|title=THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES vs. EDGARDO SANTOS Y BASA|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1978/oct1978/gr_41525_1978.html|publisher=The Supreme Court of the Philippines|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nSilvino Agudo's law office, Agudo, Reyes, Estrella and Associates, was located in rooms 205 - 208 0f the [[Puzon Building]] in Quezon City (1974).\n\nSilvino Agudo hired and trained a young [[Diosdado_Peralta|Diosdado Peralta]], now Chief Justice of Supreme Court under President Rodrigo Duterte, to work in his law firm. Agudo took Diosdado Peralta, a recent University of Santo Tomas law school graduate, and [https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/243235-things-to-know-supreme-court-chief-justice-diosdado-peralta assigned him to junior projects] related to Cosmos Bottling company, which Silvino helped establish. \n\n[[File:Batanes Governor Agudo.jpg|thumb|Silvino Barsana Agudo]]\n\n== Nominations for Governor of Batanes ==\n\nAs the 1967 mid-election approached President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] moved to ensure that his [[Nacionalista Party]] would be victorius by electing most of the Senators, Governors, and Mayors of the country. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] asked Chairman Manuel \"Maning\" Agudo to choose Silvino Barsana Agudo as candidate for Governor who will most likely win in [[Batanes]].  Manuel Agudo's reputation was critically important to Silvino Barsana Agudo's endorsement to run for Governor of [[Batanes]] because of his Chairmanship of the Civil Service Board of Appeals, tenure as Congressman of Batanes (1958\u20131961), and service as administrative officer in the Office of the President in [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] during the tenure of six Presidents of the Philippines, namely: [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]], [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], [[Manuel Roxas]], [[Elpidio Quirino]], [[Ramon Magsaysay]], and [[Carlos P. Garcia]].\n\nDuring this time Silvino Barsana Agudo was a successful law practitioner with many clients in the Filipino, American, Spanish, and Chinese communities. Precisely because of his success in law practice Silvino Barasana Agudo was induced to run for Governor of Batanes. Silvino Barsana Agudo agreed to participate in the Provincial Convention in Batanes and then boarded a Philippine Navy boat to [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]] in the month of August 1967.\n\nSilvino Barsana Agudo's trip was delayed by a typhoon but when he arrived in [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], the town was as he described it a \"gog.\" Manuel and Renee Agudo rented a house to stay and Silvino Barsana Agudo stayed in the house of his Uncle, Jose Barona, and Auntie Bilay (Severa) Barsana Barona, sister of Silvino's mother. On the night of his arrival the Batanes Veteran Association, a Chapter of the Veterans Association of the Philippines, had a program in the High School auditorium in which Silvino Barsana Agudo was recognized as a Veteran of World War II by the highest-ranking officers of the Batanes Veteran's Association.\n\nTwo days after Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo arrived in  [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], the Nacionalista Party Convention was held on top Tukon Hill. There was a band to render music while waiting for the delegates from each town: [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]], Itbayat, [[Mahatao]], [[Uyugan]], and Sabtang. When all the delegates arrived, nominations were made and three were nominated for Governor: Jose Aceron of Ivana, Tobias Abad of Basco, and Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo of Ivana. After the nominations, Jose Martinez, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo's campaign manager, talked to delegates in each town without consulting Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo. After the short campaigning, voting was done by secret ballot.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mrs. Renee Agudo, Chairwoman of the Batanes [[Nacionalista Party]] announced the winning party candidates:\nGovernor: Atty. Silvino B. Agudo; \nVice Governor: Tobais Abad; \nBoard Members (2): Emmanuel Aguasha of [[Mahatao]] and Francisco Bidayan of [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]]\n\nAfter the convention all the official candidates took the same Philippine Navy Boat back to Manila.\n\nMrs. Renee Agudo reported to President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and Senator [[Gil Puyat]] the official candidates for the [[Nacionalista Party]] in Batanes. Within one month President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] invited all the candidates for governor and city mayor to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] for individual conversations with the President. To everyone's surprise, President Marcos knew all candidates' names by heart. All candidates were also brought into a room filled with 6-foot piles of legal-sized brown envelopes. The President's aid gave one envelope to each candidate. However, Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo was pulled aside and given a second envelope which was to be for the six candidates for mayor in the Province. Atty. Silvino Barsana Agudo took a taxi home and examined the contents of the brown envelopes \u2013 each containing US$10,000 in $10 bills or $20,000 in all. In remembrance of President, Atty, Silvino Barsana Agudo bought a new refrigerator to change the old fridge. The rest of the money was distributed and spent for provisions to the Batanes campaign.\n\n== As Governor of Batanes ==\n\n\n[[File:Batanes Governor.jpg|Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo in Provincial Governor's Office in Basco, Batanes ]]\n\n\nDuring his term (1968\u20131971), Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo supported the preservation and promotion of Batanes culture through various initiatives including research of archaic Itbayaten numeral writing systems.<ref name=Research>{{cite web|last=Yamada|first=Yukihiro|title=Speech Disguise in Itbayaten Numerals|url=http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-10-01-1972/yamada-speech%20disguise%20itbayaten%20numerals.pdf|publisher=The University of the Philippines Diliman|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Suzuki Boys ==\n\nGovernor Silvino Agudo presided over [[Batanes]] during one of the province's most tumultuous times and played an instrumental role in preventing election fraud and protecting [[Ivatan people]] from armed thugs.\n\n\nIn less than a week after the November 11, 1969 Congressional Elections, Ivatans, the residents of Batanes, were up in arms against the takeover of their islands by gangster-rule during the elections. Reports of the terror that gripped Batanes province have filtered to Manila only several days after the elections, and there was nothing they could do to change the results. All they could do was call attention public attention to the \"rape of the ballot\" in their province. Their grievances were not the sour grapes of defeated politicians. They come from plain citizens talking not as NPs or LPs but, as outraged citizens who were robbed of their right to vote at gunpoint.\n\n\nThe takeover of the Batanes group by the thugs is a classic example of a swift coup that isolated the group from the rest of the country. It was cut off from airline flights and from telephone and telegraph communications. There were five candidates for the lone congressional seat of the province.\n\nThe important candidates were:\n\n- Mrs. Renee Agudo (NP)\n\n- former Congressmen Jorge Abad (father of [[Department of Budget and Management]] Secretary [[Florencio Abad]])\n\n- Rufino Antonio Jr. (Independent-NP)\n\nWeeks before the November 11, 1969 Elections, about 100 strange faces (non-Ivatans) landed in Basco and scattered in the six towns of the province. Crates also landed in [[Basco, Batanes|Basco]]. In late October, Provincial Commander (PC), Captain Fulgencio Albano, collected licensed firearms from the residents \"for verification.\" Provincial Command soldiers met Philippine Airline (PAL) Flights on October 26, 28 and November 2,4,and 6 to Basco to search landing passengers and their luggage for firearms.\n\nOn November 9, PAL suspended flights to Basco because of man-caused obstructions in the runway. A number of privately owned planes, including light aircraft including a helicopter and [[Douglas DC-3]] blocked Basco's runway. The PAL plane that carried Ivatan voters from Manila had to turn back.\n\nOn November 10, a day before the elections, telegraph communications from Basco through the Bureau of Telecommunications and Station and Radio Communications of the Philippines Incorporated (RCPI) subsequently went dead. Armed goons had allegedly destroyed all private and government wireless facilities and drove away operators of the telcom and RCPI stations; an operator of the weather bureau was reportedly tear gassed. The equipment was destroyed, however, some operators who fled to the mountains used a transmitter to report \"goon activities\" and request the Provincial Commander Fulgencio Albano and President Ferdinand Marcos for aid. Later during the night of November 10, the Bureau of Public Highways compound was raided and vehicles were destroyed.\n\nEven before this, on October 24, Ivatans in Manila held a meeting at D & E Restaurant in [[Quezon City]] and decided to ask Provincial Command and Comelec to relieve Captain Fulgencio Albano of Batanes Provincial Command. On November 2, Major Benjamin Amante became the new Batanes PC Commander. On November 7, Major Amante and Representative Roque Ablan (Ilocos Norte) flew to Basco in Ablan's plane. Major Amante stayed only a few days then left Basco before elections. The PC Officer in charge was Captain Velasco.\n\nOn election day November 11, 1969, the roads leading to the six towns of Batanes were barricaded by checkpoints manned by armed thugs. Governor Agudo and his party making tours of the towns were turned back at one of the checkpoints and warned if they proceeded  they might be ambushed. An American Peace Corps Volunteer, Larry Jones, was given six hours to surrender photographs of goons terrorizing voters at precincts.\n\nThree days after the elections, Batanes was one of the few provinces from which results of the congressional elections were not heard. In the past elections, which were peaceful, results were known by the next day, there being only less than 5,000 votes to count. In Manila, Governor Silvino Agudo's wife, Honorata Agudo, asked Executive Secretary [[Ernesto Maceda]] to assign security men to her house near Quezon City because suspicious looking men were loitering near their home.\n\n==Batanes Bicentennial Commission==\n\nGov. Silvino Barsana Agudo remained active in provincial affairs into his retired days as President of the Batanes Bicentennial Commission in 1983.<ref name=BatanesOnline>{{cite web|title=IVATANS TO COMMEMORATE BATANES BICENTENNIAL|url=http://www.batanesonline.com/Yesteryears/ContentsYesteryears/Bicentenial.htm|publisher=BatanesOnline|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1983, on the initiative of the Dominican Fathers in Santo Domingo Church in [[Quezon City]], a Bicentennial Commission was created to plan the celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Christianization of [[Batanes]] and establishment of a centralized civil government therein. (In 1773, two missionaries from the Dominican Order from [[Tuguegarao]], [[Cagayan]] landed in [[Ivana, Batanes]] and stayed to put up their church. Ten years later in June 1783, the Civil Government was established in [[Basco, Batanes]])\n\nThe Bicentennial Commission was composed of Ivatans from [[Manila]] environs invited by the [[Santo Domingo]] Fathers. The Fathers consulted Engineer Anastacio Agan, former Congressmen from Batanes and at that time incumbent [[Quezon City]] Engineer.  Congressmen Agan was also the structural engineer who built the Santo Domingo Church on [[Quezon Avenue]] in [[Quezon City]]. He was assisted in the job of construction of the Santo Domingo Church by Engineer Ruperto Agudo.\n\nThe assembly of Ivatans who were invited to form the Commission elected the following officers: President, Ex-Governor Silvino B. Agudo; Vice President and Chairman of the Committee on Public Information, Dr. Florentino H. Hornedo; Secretary, Fr. Alfonso Loreto, O.P.; Treasurer, Rev. Fr. Rey Adadlid, O.P.; Committee of Ways and Means: Chairman-Dr. Francisco Roman; Co-Chairman Mrs. Josefina Castro-Valera. Members were Mrs. Rucela Barsana Acacio, Mrs. Ana G. Agagan; Atty. Antonio Alcantara, Sor. Pia Alcazar, O.P., Captain Pedro Doplito, Atty. Carlos Castano, Bro. N. Comaya, O.P. Captain Pedro Doplito, Atty. Antonio Escalante; Mrs. Agapita Fagar, Fr. Ermito De Sagun, O.P., and Mrs. Eutropia Hornedo-Silvestre.\n\nThe Bicentennial Anniversary was celebrated in two places, one in the Aquinas School at Sanctuario de Sto. Cristo at [[Blumentritt Road]], San Juan Del Monte, Metro Manila and the other was held in [[Basco, Batanes]] under the joint auspices of the Provincial Government and the Bishop of Batanes Msgr. Mario Baltazar O.P. Silvino Agudo, as President of the Commission lead both occasions.\n\n==YouTube hit success==\n\nMost recently, Governor Silvino Barsana Agudo's YouTube videos recorded by his grandchildren, Patrick and Caroline Agudo Waterman, highlight Governor Agudo singing native Ivatan songs, {{YouTube|SUbZ-sORWuc|\"IVASAY KAMOSAWEN\"}}<ref name=YouTube>{{cite web|last=Agudo|first=Silvino|title=Ivatan Song|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUbZ-sORWuc|publisher=Patrick Waterman|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref> and {{YouTube|B-Zfh7fImRs|\"YAHES MO DU VITUGEN\"}}.<ref name=\"YouTube 2\">{{cite web|title=Yahes Mo Du Vitugen|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Zfh7fImRs|publisher=Patrick Waterman|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>  At the age of 91, Silvino Barsana Agudo's folk renditions has gained the attention from the Ivatan diaspora.\n\n==Death==\n\nGovernor Silvino Barsana Agudo passed away at the age of 93 years old on December 17, 2010, in [[Sacramento,_California|Sacramento, California]].

Bartik and her colleagues developed and codified many of the fundamentals of [[Programming language|programming]] while working on the ENIAC, since it was the first computer of its kind.\n\nAfter her work on ENIAC, Bartik went on to work on [[BINAC]] and [[UNIVAC]], and spent time at a variety of technical companies as a writer, manager, engineer and programmer. She spent her later years as a real estate agent and died in 2011 from congestive heart failure complications.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn '''Betty Jean Jennings''' in [[Gentry County, Missouri]], in 1924, she was the sixth of seven children.

However, according to a Northrop Aircraft programmer, despite claims that the BINAC didn't work once it was moved to Northrop Aircraft were erroneous and the BINAC was working well into the mid-1950s.<ref name=\":autobio\" />  Besides, BINAC, Jean's more important work involved her responsibilities in designing the UNIVAC's [[Logic gate|logic circuits]] among other UNIVAC programming and design tasks.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bartik also co-programmed with her life-long friend [[Betty Holberton]] the first generative programming system ([[Sort Merge Generator|SORT/MERGE]]) for a computer.<ref name=\":5\" />  Recalling her time working with Eckert and Mauchly on these projects, she described their close group of computer engineers as a \"technical Camelot.\"<ref name=\"NYTobit\" /><ref name=\":autobio\" /><ref name=\"YA Bio\" >{{cite book|last1=Reed|first1=Jennifer|title=Computer Scientist Jean Bartik (STEM Trailblazer Bios)|publisher=Lerner Publications|isbn=1512413100}}</ref><ref name=\":autobio\" /><ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn the early 1950s, once the [[Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation|Eckert-Mauchly Corporation]] was sold to [[Remington Rand]] Bartik went on to help train on how to program and use the UNIVAC for the first six UNIVACs sold, including the programmers at the United States Census Bureau (first UNIVAC sold) and Atomic Energy Commission.<ref name=\":autobio\" />  Later, Bartik moved to Philadelphia when her husband, William \"Bill\" Bartik, took a job with Remington Rand.  Unfortunately, due to a company policy at the time about husbands and wives working together, Jean Bartik, was asked to resign from the company. Between 1951 and 1954, prior to her first child's birth, Jean did mostly free-lance programming assignments for [[John Mauchly]] and was a helpmate to her husband.  Once her son was born, Jean walked away from her career in computing to concentrate on raising a family, during which time she had two other children with her husband.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":autobio\" /><ref name=\"YA Bio\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> It was sometime during this 1950s period that Bartik began going by the name \"Jean\" rather than her birth first name \"Betty\", which is what she had been known as during her ENIAC, UNIVAC and Remington-Rand years.\n\nEven though Bartik played an integral part in developing ENIAC, her work at University of Pennsylvania and on the ENIAC was completely hidden until her pioneering work was documented by columnist [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB848618358629375500 Tom Petzinger] in several articles for the [[Wall Street Journal]] on Bartik and Holberton.<ref name=\":autobio\" /><ref name=\"YA Bio\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":autobio\" /> Later, a film called [[Top Secret Rosies: The Female \"Computers\" of WWII]] helped shed even more light on Bartik's pioneering work in computing along with Kathy Kleiman's [http://eniacprogrammers.org/ ENIAC Programmers Project].\n\n==Later life==\nAfter getting her master's degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1967 and making the decision to divorce her husband, Bartik joined the [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/26/nyregion/isaac-l-auerbach-is-dead-at-71-was-early-advocate-of-computers.html Auerbach Corporation] writing and editing technical reports on [[minicomputer]]s.<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=ieee/> Bartik remained with Auerbach for eight years, then moved among positions with a variety of other companies for the rest of her career as a manager, writer, and engineer.<ref name=\":1\"/> Jean Bartik and William Bartik divorced by 1968.<ref name=\"NYTobit\"/> Bartik ultimately retired from the computing industry in 1986 when her final employer, Data Decisions (a publication of Ziff-Davis), was sold; Bartik spent the following 25 years as a real estate agent.\n\nStarting in 1996, once the importance of their role in the development of computing was re-discovered, Bartik along with Betty Holberton and Bartik's other friend of over 60 years [[Kathleen Antonelli]] (ENIAC programmer and wife of ENIAC co-inventor [[John Mauchly]]) began to finally receive the acknowledgement and honors for their pioneering work in the early field of computing.  Bartik and Antonelli became invited speakers both at home and abroad to share their experiences working with the ENIAC, BINAC and UNIVAC.  Bartik especially went on to receive many honors and awards for her pioneering role programming the ENIAC, BINAC and UNIVAC, the latter of which helped to launch the commercial computer industry, and for turning the ENIAC into the world's first stored program computer.  The [https://www.nwmissouri.edu/archives/computing/index.htm Jean Jennings Bartik Computing Museum] was opened in 2002 on the campus of [[Northwest Missouri State University]], Bartik's alma mater, in her honor.  Bartik was inducted into the [[Computer History Museum|Computer History Museum's]] distinguished Hall of Fellows along with [[Linus Torvalds]], creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel and [[Robert Metcalf]], father of Ethernet, in 2008.  Bartik wrote her autobiography \"[https://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-Programmer-Jennings-Computer-Changed/dp/1612480861/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518753785&sr=8-1&keywords=Jean+Bartik Pioneer Programmer:  Jean Jennings Bartik and the Computer that Changed the World]\" prior to her death in 2011 with the help of long-time colleagues, Dr. Jon T.
