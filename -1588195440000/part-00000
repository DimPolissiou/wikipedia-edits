Observations and surveying were conducted on the islands and [[oceanographic]] measurements performed in the sea around it.

However, the British position was weakened by Norris's sighting of two islands and the uncertainty as to whether he had been on Thompson or Liverpool (i.e. Bouvet) Island. Norris's positioning deviating from the correct location combined with the island's small size and lack of a [[natural harbour]] made the UK accept the Norwegian claim.<ref>Kyvik (2008): 52</ref> This resulted in diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and in November 1929, Britain renounced its claim to the island.<ref name=b63 />\n\nThe [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen#The Norvegia expeditions|Second ''Norvegia'' Expedition]] arrived in 1928 with the intent of establishing a manned meteorological radio station, but a suitable location could not be found.<ref name=b63 /> By then both the flagpole and hut from the previous year had been washed away.

In 1978\u201379 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding [[penguins]] on the island, consisting of [[macaroni penguin]]<!--Eudyptes chrysolophus--> and, to a lesser extent, [[chinstrap penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis antarctica--> and [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis adeliae-->, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989\u201390. Nyr\u00f8ysa is the most important [[bird colony|colony]] for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Lars\u00f8ya. [[Southern fulmar]]<!--Fulmarus glacialoides--> is by far the most common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of [[Cape petrel]]<!--Daption capense-->, [[Antarctic prion]]<!--Pachyptila desolata-->, [[Wilson's storm petrel]]<!--Oceanites oceanicus-->, [[black-bellied storm petrel]]<!--Fregetta tropica-->, [[subantarctic skua]]<!--Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi-->, [[southern giant petrel]]<!--Macronectes giganteus-->, [[snow petrel]]<!--Pagodroma nivea-->, [[slender-billed prion]]<!--Pachyptila belcheri--> and [[Antarctic tern]]<!--Sterna vittata-->. [[Kelp gull]]<!--Larus dominicanus--> is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the [[king penguin]], [[wandering albatross]], [[black-browed albatross]], [[Campbell albatross]], [[Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross]], [[sooty albatross]], [[light-mantled albatross]], [[northern giant petrel]], [[Antarctic petrel]], [[blue petrel]], [[soft-plumaged petrel]], [[Kerguelen petrel]], [[white-headed petrel]], [[fairy prion]], [[white-chinned petrel]], [[great shearwater]], [[common diving petrel]], [[south polar skua]] and [[parasitic jaeger]].<ref name=birdlife />\n\nThe only non-bird [[vertebrate]]s on the island are [[pinniped|seals]], specifically the [[southern elephant seal]] and [[Antarctic fur seal]], which both breed on the island.

The flora are representative for the maritime Antarctic and are [[phytogeographically]] similar to the [[South Sandwich Islands]] and [[South Shetland Islands]]. Vegetation is limited because of the ice cover, although [[snow algae]] are recorded. The remaining vegetation is located in snow-free areas such as [[nunatak]] ridges and other parts of the summit plateau, the coastal cliffs, capes and beaches. At Nyr\u00f8ysa, five species of moss, six ascomycetes (including five lichens), and twenty algae have been recorded. Most snow-free areas are so steep and subject to frequent [[avalanche]]s that only [[crustose]] lichens and algal formations are sustainable. There are six [[endemic]] ascomycetes, three of which are lichenized.<ref name=birdlife />\n[[File:Bouvet island.jpg|thumb|left|Cape Valdivia, Bouvet Island, 2009]]\nThe island has been designated as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]] because of its importance as a [[breeding ground]] for [[seabird]]s. In 1978\u201379 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding [[penguins]] on the island, consisting of [[macaroni penguin]]<!--Eudyptes chrysolophus--> and, to a lesser extent, [[chinstrap penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis antarctica--> and [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]<!--Pygoscelis adeliae-->, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989\u201390. Nyr\u00f8ysa is the most important [[bird colony|colony]] for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Lars\u00f8ya. [[Southern fulmar]]<!--Fulmarus glacialoides--> is by far the most common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of [[Cape petrel]]<!--Daption capense-->, [[Antarctic prion]]<!--Pachyptila desolata-->, [[Wilson's storm petrel]]<!--Oceanites oceanicus-->, [[black-bellied storm petrel]]<!--Fregetta tropica-->, [[subantarctic skua]]<!--Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi-->, [[southern giant petrel]]<!--Macronectes giganteus-->, [[snow petrel]]<!--Pagodroma nivea-->, [[slender-billed prion]]<!--Pachyptila belcheri--> and [[Antarctic tern]]<!--Sterna vittata-->. [[Kelp gull]]<!--Larus dominicanus--> is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the [[king penguin]], [[wandering albatross]], [[black-browed albatross]], [[Campbell albatross]], [[Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross]], [[sooty albatross]], [[light-mantled albatross]], [[northern giant petrel]], [[Antarctic petrel]], [[blue petrel]], [[soft-plumaged petrel]], [[Kerguelen petrel]], [[white-headed petrel]], [[fairy prion]], [[white-chinned petrel]], [[great shearwater]], [[common diving petrel]], [[south polar skua]] and [[parasitic jaeger]].<ref name=birdlife />\n\nThe only non-bird [[vertebrate]]s on the island are [[pinniped|seals]], specifically the [[southern elephant seal]] and [[Antarctic fur seal]], which both breed on the island.

Hazel is after the heart of a boy named Almond. Most of the Pok\u00e9mon in the manga series can speak a human language. [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]], author of ''Manga: The Complete Guide'', wrote that, based on the plot, it \"might as well not be about Pok\u00e9mon at all\".<ref name=ThompsonPT/>\n\nThe manga is licensed in English in North America by [[Viz Media]] and in Singapore by [[Chuang Yi]]. Viz published seven of the ten volumes flipped to the Western left-to-right format.\n\nA spinoff series, {{nihongo|'''''Pocket Monsters Chamo-Chamo \u2605 Pretty \u266a'''''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30c1\u30e3\u30e2\u30c1\u30e3\u30e2\u2605\u3077\u308a\u3066\u3043\u266a|Pocketto Monsut\u0101 Chamochamo\u2605Puriti\u266a}}, features the adventures and exploits of Clefairy and Pikachu, as well as Torchic and Mightyena. The chamo-chamo refers to \"Achamo\", [[Torchic]]'s Japanese name.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans===\n; {{nihongo|Hazel|\u30de\u30ed\u30f3|Maron}}\n:The main character of this series. She's a bubble-headed blonde who's madly in love with her friend Almond, and adores cute Pok\u00e9mon such as [[Pikachu]] and [[Clefairy]]. As a child, she was an irrepressible tomboy who enjoyed playing pranks on Almond; now that she's older, she's still quite hyper, but in a more girlish way.\n\n; {{nihongo|Almond|\u30a2\u30fc\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Aamondo}}\n:The love interest of the series. He calls himself a Pok\u00e9mon trainer, but it's not known what Pok\u00e9mon he has, or even if he has any besides Squirtle, who is more of a friend than a trained Pok\u00e9mon. Almond shows little to no interest in either Hazel or Coconut, until the final volume...\n\n; {{nihongo|Coconut|\u30b3\u30b3\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4|Kokonattsu}}\n:Grandpa's granddaughter, and Hazel's rival for Almond's love. She's a brilliant scientist, and so spends much of her time brewing love potions that backfire in some manner, usually injuring her [[Eevee]]. Later on, a man named Caraway confesses his love for Coconut, but she isn't interested.\n\n; {{nihongo|Grandpa|\u3058\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093|Jii-chan}}\n:Isn't Hazel's grandfather, as she points out to Almond when Coconut first appears. He's simply a crazy old man whom everybody calls \"Grandpa\". He likes to ogle young women, even though he's married to Ginger. He made Hazel the outfit she wears much of the time; it has magical properties that can protect her from injury and even drowning. Owns  POG  Inc., but left because running a business isn't fun, and Ginger took over for him.\n\n; {{nihongo|Peanut|\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9|Piisu}}\n:A sickly boy who recently moved to Hazel's town for reasons related to his health. His Pok\u00e9mon is a hotheaded [[Charmander]]. His bad health is caused by a mass of dark [[qi]] surrounding him; he is able to communicate with and control this qi, which is quite unusual.\n\n; {{nihongo|Pistachio|\u30d4\u30b9\u30bf\u30c1\u30aa|Pisutachio}}\n:Peanut's brother, a florist who has a thing for Hazel. Due to a mix-up on Viz's website, many people believe that in the Japanese version of the manga, he's really attracted to Almond; however, this is not true. Pistachio's [[Bulbasaur]], named Danerina, has a crush on him, as does Chiko the [[Chikorita]].\n\n; {{nihongo|Walnut|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb|Wooru}}\n:A [[ninja]]-in-training under the great ninja master Ditto. He's a bumbling goof, though. When he's not training, he works in his family's bakery. Wal wears glasses when not training, and contact lenses when in ninja uniform.\n\n; {{nihongo|Sandy|\u30ca\u30ae\u30b5|Nagisa}}\n:A 150-year-old ghost. When she first appears, [[Raichu]] is angry with her. Sandy's parents left him in a box by the ocean because he had a tendency to shock people, and Sandy promised to meet him there; however, just before they could meet, they were both killed by a tidal wave. Once Sandy explains this, Raichu forgives her and they are able to \"cross over\". They appear in later chapters to help pacify an angry Golduck ghost, and are reincarnated in the final volume.\n\n; {{nihongo|Apricot|\u5c0f\u6885|Koume}}\n:First appears in the eighth volume. Since only the first seven volumes were translated into English in America, most fans don't know of her, even though she's an important character. She is also a ninja-in-training, though she's much more accomplished than Walnut. Her master, [[Azumarill]], is even more talented than [[Ditto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ditto]]; Azumarill's daughter, a [[Marill]] named Marimaru, is Koume's partner. Apricot is addicted to bread, and winds up falling in love with Walnut.\n\n; {{nihongo|Plum|\u30d7\u30e9\u30e0|Puramu}}\n:First appears in the ninth volume. She's an [[exorcist]] nurse who travels around with her senior, a Chansey, exorcising bad qi. She discovers the reason for Peanut's ill health, but she is unable to exorcise it. She falls in love with Peanut.\n\n; {{nihongo|Caraway|\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4|Kyarawei}}\n:First appears in the tenth and final volume. As soon as he meets Coconut, he falls for her and kisses her on the lips. Because of this, Coconut absolutely refuses to even give him a chance, until he helps her with an experiment she's working on. After that, she becomes friends with Caraway, but still isn't romantically interested in him.\n\n; {{nihongo|Ginger | \u30b8\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc | Ginger }}\n:First  appears  in  the  seventh  volume. She  is  Grandpa's  wife! She  came  to  issue  him  a challenge 'Win  best  inventions  prize  at  the  upcoming \ninventors  contest  or  move  back  home. She  has  a Natu  and  Girafarig. She  is  currently  running  POG  Inc.!\n\n; {{nihongo|Haruka|\u30cf\u30eb\u30ab|Haruka}}\n:A character featured in the spin-off series after obtaining her first Pok\u00e9mon, [[Torchic]]. She is based on, or as largely same as [[May (Pok\u00e9mon)|May]] from [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon anime series]], with only costumes changed.\n\n===Pok\u00e9mon characters===\n; {{nihongo|[[Pikachu]]|\u30d4\u30ab\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6|Pikachuu}}\n:The first Pok\u00e9mon to appear in this series, is Hazel's best friend -- not surprising, as both of them can be described as scatterbrains. Pikachu is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon in MPJ who cannot speak human language. Pikachu appears as a male one.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Clefairy]]|\u30d4\u30c3\u30d4|Pippi}}\n:Hazel's second Pok\u00e9mon friend, and is a scaredy cat. He dislikes battling because he views himself as weak, even though his Metronome technique is quite powerful. He also uses Minimize often, usually when he gets frightened (which can happen at the drop of a hat).\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Jigglypuff]]|\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3|Purin}}\n:A spoiled princess Pok\u00e9mon whose family lives in a castle. Jigglypuff loves to cook, but she's terrible at it while looks delicious at first glance. Not seeming to realize this, she gets horribly offended when nobody wants to eat the food she makes.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Squirtle]]|\u30bc\u30cb\u30ac\u30e1|Zenigame}}\n:The only boy Pok\u00e9mon to live at the Jigglypuff mansion. He calls Almond his \"big brother\", but at the same time seems to be absorbed by him.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Eevee]]|\u30a4\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4|Iibui}}\n:Coconut's Pok\u00e9mon and lab assistant. He's usually in the way when her experiments go wrong, and is quite an unlucky fellow. In the sixth volume, he meets and falls in love with...\n\n; {{nihongo|Lu|\u308b\u30fc|Ruu}}\n:A female Eevee. At first, she loved Eevee from afar, but she managed to confess her feelings to him at the prompting of Hazel and Coconut. Later, she has to move away, but she occasionally visits Eevee.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Charmander]]|\u30d2\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2|Hitokage}}\n:Peanut's companion, and his fiery temper is in stark contrast to the boy's quiet personality. Charmander gets angry when things don't go his way, which happens more often than not. At first he seemed to have a thing for Coconut's Eevee (who is male), but in later volumes he seems more attracted to Chiko.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Bulbasaur]]|\u30c0\u30cd\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Daneriina}}\n:Danerina is Pistachio's Bulbasaur. She seems to be possessive and will get angry if Pistachio talks to other women.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Ditto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ditto]]|\u30d3\u30fc|Bii}}\n:Wal's ninja master. He's a quite accomplished ninja, even though he's just a pink blob.\n\n; {{nihongo|Marimaru|\u30de\u30ea\u4e38|Marimaru}}\n:The [[Marill]] is Koume's ninja partner, both of them training under Marimaru's mother, '''Azumarill'''.\n\n; {{nihongo|Roko|\u30ed\u30b3|Roko|| and}} {{nihongo|Arashi|\u30a2\u30e9\u30b7|Arashi}}\n:Two of Caraway's Pok\u00e9mon. Roko the Vulpix (''Rokon'' is the Japanese name of ''Vulpix'') has a thing for Arashi the Cyndaquil (''Hinoarashi'' is the Japanese name of ''Cyndaquil''), despite his being somewhat dim-witted. They meet Coconut while searching for a Fire Stone.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Chansey]]|\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc|Rakkii}}\n:Plum's senior, an exorcist nurse. She uses her magical egg powers in conjunction with Plum's cross to purify people troubled by bad qi.\n\n; {{nihongo|[[Raichu]]|\u30e9\u30a4\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6|Raichuu}}\n:Sandy's Pok\u00e9mon, was abandoned by the shore.\n\n; {{nihongo|Chiko|\u30c1\u30b3|Chiko}}\n:Appears in order to challenge Danerina the Bulbasaur's claim on Pistachio. They have a contest to see which one is good enough to him, with Chiko winning. However, Pistachio prefers Danerina's company, as she is his Pok\u00e9mon and Chiko is an interloper. (But Pistachio's not thrilled with the Pok\u00e9mon being in love with him....) After this, Chikorita falls in love with Almond, and then with Charmander.\n\n; {{nihongo|Yousuke|\u30e8\u30a6\u30b9\u30b1|Yousuke}}\n:A male Bayleef belonging to a traveling psychic named Akira. He has a thing for Chiko, but she prefers Charmander.\n\n; {{nihongo|Azumarill | \u30de\u30ea\u30eb\u30ea| Marilli }}\nAzumarill is Apricot's ninja teacher and Marimaru's mother.\n\n; {{nihongo|Torchic | \u30a2\u30c1\u30e3\u30e2 | Achamo }}\n:Owned by Haruka, Torchic quickly meets and becomes friends with Pikachu and Clefairy, and then meets Poochyena, with whom she winds up arguing frequently. Soon after that, she meets Mightyena, Poochyena's older brother, who she falls in love with. Torchic dreads the thought of ever evolving. She believes that Combusken and [[Blaziken]] are ugly Pok\u00e9mon and can't stand the thought of not being cute and adorable anymore.\n\n;{{nihongo|Poochyena| \u30dd\u30c1\u30a8\u30ca| Pochaena}}\n:Owned by Kanata, Poochyena is introduced where Torchic mistakes him as a Prince Charming. Poochyena doesn't get along with Torchic at all; he calls her \"shorty\" and she calls him \"hick-Poochy\".

He also saved Hazel who got injured by skiing in the mountains. \n\n;[[Onix and Steelix|Onix]]\n:A harmless and friendly rock snake Pok\u00e9mon, he only appears to save humans.

Hazel wants to see what Tangela's face looks like beneath the vines. However, Tangela is frightened by the intrusive Hazel and constricts her. Luckily, the confusion is settled and Tangela, who communicates by pressing a vine to a person's forehead, agrees to let Hazel see its face. Though because of her clumsy painting skills, still no one knows how Tangela looks like of except Hazel.\n\n;Dragonair\n:A male dragon Pok\u00e9mon, he appears in the sky snowing.

He was arrested and exiled several times, spending time in most of Russia's large jails.<ref name=\"MOSCOW\">[http://www.mos.ru/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9SP0o83izECfXQHMPIwODQFMTAyMXFwNnFydvYwMLc_3InNT0xORK_Qj9KDOc6gxM9QtyXBUB5pPFAQ!!?nID=6_6TBEQ7H200Q5402DD0CDBK3005&cID=6_6TBEQ7H200Q5402DD0CDBK3005&rubricId=14050&documentId=100197]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Moscow City Government</ref>\n\nNogin was considered a \"conciliator\" Bolshevik. In 1910, following the split between the Bolsheviks and the [[Menshevik]]s, he convinced the leadership to try to reunite the party, despite strong opposition from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]. This ultimately failed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n[[File:Nogin polits. kart. 1907.jpg|thumb|right| Nogin police card, 1907]]\n\nBy 1917 Nogin was one of the leaders of the Moscow branch of Bolsheviks. He was a member of the Provisional Committee during the struggle against General [[Lavr Kornilov]]'s [[Kornilov affair|failed coup]] in [[Petrograd]].<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/> He was a member of the Executive Committee of [[Mossovet|Moscow Soviet of People's Deputies]]. As Chairman of the Moscow Military-Revolutionary Committee, Nogin tried to lead a peaceful and bloodless transfer of power to the Bolsheviks, hoping to avoid more bloodshed in Moscow.<ref>''The Russian Revolution: 1917-1921'', Ronald I. Kowalski, page 95</ref> Before a session of the RSDLP Central Committee on 1 November 1917 he joined [[Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Vladimir Milyutin|Milyutin]] in advocating the creation of a coalition government involving all of the socialist parties, claiming that a Bolshevik-only government could only be sustained through terror. He left government on 4 November 1917.<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/>\n\nAfter he formally admitted his mistakes on 29 November 1917, Nogin was appointed to a national post, where he helped restore the nation's textile industry which had been damaged in the revolution. He enjoyed great authority in foreign trade and industry circles.<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/> He accompanied [[Leonid Krasin]] to [[London]] for the negotiations over the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]]. In 1923, Nogin traveled to the United States to arrange a major cotton purchase. While there, he helped the [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] administration communicate with Moscow using the code of the Soviet government, in an attempt to establish friendly relations between the two countries.<ref>''Reform and Revolution: The Life and Times of Raymond Robins'', Neil V. Salzman, page 313</ref>\n\nViktor Nogin is buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] in [[Red Square]], Moscow.\n\n==Positions held==\nSome of the Bolshevik party and government positions held by Viktor Nogin are listed below:<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/>\n*Executive Committee of the Moscow Soviet of Workers' Deputies (before 1917)\n*Central Committee member at the [[6th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)|Sixth Congress of the RSDLP]] (July \u2013 August 1917)\n*[[People's Commissariat for Trade and Industry|People's Commissar for Trade and Industry]] in the first cabinet of the Council of People's Commissars at the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets\n*Chairman of the Moscow Soviet of Workers' Deputies, succeeding Menshevik L.M.

He was arrested and exiled several times, spending time in most of Russia's large jails.<ref name=\"MOSCOW\">[http://www.mos.ru/wps/portal/!ut/p/c0/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9SP0o83izECfXQHMPIwODQFMTAyMXFwNnFydvYwMLc_3InNT0xORK_Qj9KDOc6gxM9QtyXBUB5pPFAQ!!?nID=6_6TBEQ7H200Q5402DD0CDBK3005&cID=6_6TBEQ7H200Q5402DD0CDBK3005&rubricId=14050&documentId=100197]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Moscow City Government</ref>\n\nNogin was considered a \"conciliator\" Bolshevik. In 1910, following the split between the Bolsheviks and the [[Menshevik]]s, he convinced the leadership to try to reunite the party, despite strong opposition from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]. This ultimately failed.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n[[File:Nogin polits. kart. 1907.jpg|thumb|right| Nogin police card, 1907]]\n\nBy 1917 Nogin was one of the leaders of the Moscow branch of Bolsheviks. He was a member of the Provisional Committee during the struggle against General [[Lavr Kornilov]]'s [[Kornilov affair|failed coup]] in [[Petrograd]].<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/> He was a member of the Executive Committee of [[Mossovet|Moscow Soviet of People's Deputies]]. As Chairman of the Moscow Military-Revolutionary Committee, Nogin tried to lead a peaceful and bloodless transfer of power to the Bolsheviks, hoping to avoid more bloodshed in Moscow.<ref>''The Russian Revolution: 1917-1921'', Ronald I. Kowalski, page 95</ref> Before a session of the RSDLP Central Committee on 1 November 1917 he joined [[Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]] and [[Vladimir Milyutin|Milyutin]] in advocating the creation of a coalition government involving all of the socialist parties, claiming that a Bolshevik-only government could only be sustained through terror. He left government on 4 November 1917.<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/>\n\nAfter he formally admitted his mistakes on 29 November 1917, Nogin was appointed to a national post, where he helped restore the nation's textile industry which had been damaged in the revolution. He enjoyed great authority in foreign trade and industry circles.<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/> He accompanied [[Leonid Krasin]] to [[London]] for the negotiations over the [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]]. In 1923, Nogin traveled to the United States to arrange a major cotton purchase. While there, he helped the [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] administration communicate with Moscow using the code of the Soviet government, in an attempt to establish friendly relations between the two countries.<ref>''Reform and Revolution: The Life and Times of Raymond Robins'', Neil V. Salzman, page 313</ref>\n\nViktor Nogin is buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] in [[Red Square]], Moscow.\n\n==Positions held==\nSome of the Bolshevik party and government positions held by Viktor Nogin are listed below:<ref name=\"MOSCOW\"/>\n*Executive Committee of the Moscow Soviet of Workers' Deputies (before 1917)\n*Central Committee member at the [[6th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)|Sixth Congress of the RSDLP]] (July \u2013 August 1917)\n*[[People's Commissariat for Trade and Industry|People's Commissar for Trade and Industry]] in the first cabinet of the Council of People's Commissars at the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets\n*Chairman of the Moscow Soviet of Workers' Deputies, succeeding Menshevik L.M.
