Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a ''match'') is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a \"tie\" or \"draw\", in which there is no single winner; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]] to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]].\n\nSport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sports |title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events |publisher=The Olympic Movement|date=2018-11-14 }}</ref> and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<ref name=council/> However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[xiangqi]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=World Mind Games |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&idContent=658 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021848/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&idContent=658 |archivedate=8 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=Members |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&idIndex=32 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507073823/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&idIndex=32 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<ref name=sportaccord/>\n\nSport is usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.\n\nRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]]. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sport betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.\n\nAccording to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |journal=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}</ref> The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while [[association football]] is the most popular spectator sport.<ref name=wa/>\n\n==Meaning and usage==\n===Etymology===\nThe word \"sport\" comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning \"[[leisure]]\", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being \"anything humans find amusing or entertaining\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&searchmode=none |title=sport (n.) |accessdate=20 April 2008 |first=Douglas |last=Harper |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nOther meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.<ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher=G&C Merriam Company |location=Springfield, MA |page=2206 |year=1967}}</ref> Roget's defines the noun sport as an \"activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement\" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://archive.org/details/rogetsiiinewthes00houg |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-618-25414-9 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe singular term \"sport\" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. \"children taking part in sport\"), with \"sports\" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. \"football and rugby are the most popular sports in England\"). American English uses \"sports\" for both terms.\n\n===Definition===\n{{see also|Game#Definitions}}\n[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The [[International Olympic Committee]] recognises some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]\n[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]\nThe precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.\n\nSportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:<ref name=sportaccord/>\n* have an element of competition\n* be in no way harmful to any living creature\n* not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])\n* not rely on any \"luck\" element specifically designed into the sport.\n\nThey also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[Go (game)|Go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).<ref name=sportaccord/>\n\nThe inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201 |date=2015-09-22}}</ref> Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.\n\nThere has been an increase in the application of the term \"sport\" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to [[Council of Europe]], European Sports Charter, article 2.i, {{\"'}}Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.\"<ref>Council of Europe, [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016804c9dbb Revised European Sports Charter] (2001)</ref>\n\n===Competition===\nThere are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sports]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.<ref name=sportaccord/>\n\nOther bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.\n\nIn order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.<ref>{{cite news |last=Front |first=Rebecca |work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=ParentDish |title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}</ref>\n\nIn competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their \"result\" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with \"handicaps\" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving (sport)|diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of sport}}\n[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]\n\nArtifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm |title=Sports History in China}}</ref> Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past.

Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the [[Olympic Games]], which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title=Ancient Olympic Games|date=2018-07-30}}</ref>\n\nSports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes&nbsp;\u2013 all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st&nbsp;century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].<ref>''Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections'', p. 111, Sarah K. Fields (2014){{ISBN?}}|</ref>\n\n==Fair play==\n===Sportsmanship===\n{{Main article|Sportsmanship}}\n{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}\n\nSportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Sportsmanship}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fish |first1=Joel |last2=Magee |first2=Susan |year=2003 |title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent |publisher=Fireside |page=168}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lacey |first=David |date=10 November 2007 |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html |title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nSportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's \"not that you won or lost but how you played the game\", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: \"The most important thing... is not winning but taking part\" are typical expressions of this sentiment.\n\n===Cheating===\n{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}\nKey principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.\n\nParticipants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.\n\n===Doping and drugs===\n{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}\nThe competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].\n\nAll sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.\n\n===Violence===\n[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.\n\n==Participation==\n===Gender participation===\n[[File:100 metres race winner Sina Schielke (192) and the other Runners - ISTAF 2006 - Berlin, 3 September.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|International level female athletes at [[ISTAF Berlin]], 2006]]\n{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}\n{{see also|Women's sports|Women's professional sports|Women's sports in the United States}}\nFemale participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]]. Despite gains during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973\u201374 to a 63% increase in 1994\u201395.

According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including [[concussion]].

As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.\n\n===Spectator involvement===\n[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]\n{{Main article|Spectator sport}}\nThe competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].\n\nBoth amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.\n\nIt is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700&nbsp;million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of 135&nbsp;million in India alone.<ref>{{Cite news |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |date=10 April 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |accessdate=1 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013151/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.<ref name=\"SB15\">{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html |title=Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html |title=Super Bowl most watched television show in US history |work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref>\nSuper Bowl Sunday is a ''de facto'' national holiday in America;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanfootballinternational.com/super-bowl-sunday-worldwide-american-football-holiday/ |title=Super Bowl Sunday is a Worldwide American Football Holiday |publisher=American Football International Review |date=1 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o2QpA0fGyiIC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=super+bowl+de+facto+holiday#v=onepage&q=super%20bowl%20de%20facto%20holiday&f=false |last1=Markovits |first1=Andrei |last2=Rensmann |first2=Lars |title=Gaming the World: How Sports Are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture |page=94 |date=2010 |accessdate=8 June 2015|isbn=9781400834662 }}</ref> the viewership being so great that in 2015, advertising space was reported as being sold at [[$]]4.5m for a 30-second slot.<ref name=\"SB15\"/>\n\n==Amateur and professional==\n[[File:Volleyball-5 (9786053885).jpg|thumb|Women's volleyball team of a U.S. university.]]\n{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}\nSport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]).

Until the mid-20th&nbsp;century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fulton |first=Gareth |last2=Bairner |first2=Alan |year=2007 |title=Sport, Space and National Identity in Ireland: The GAA, Croke Park and Rule&nbsp;42. |url= |journal=Space & Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201374 |via=}}</ref> is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule&nbsp;21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.\n\n[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.\n\nSport and politics collided in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].\n\nA study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5&nbsp;percent.

Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as na\u00efvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.<ref>[[\u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie]], ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (1549), Part 2</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Religious views==\n[[File:Panathenaic amphora Kleophrades Louvre F277.jpg|thumb|The foot race was one of the events dedicated to Zeus.

The [[ancient Olympic Games]], called the Olympiad, were held in honour of the head deity, [[Zeus]], and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods.<ref>Gardinier, Norman E., 'The Olympic Festival' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London: MacMillan, 1910, p.195</ref> As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them.\n\nThe practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of [[idolatry]], in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.\"<ref name=Watson1>''Sports and Christianity: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives'', Nick J. Watson, ed. (Routledge: 2013), p. 178.</ref> Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of \"collective pride\" and \"national self-deification\" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.<ref name=Watson1/>\n\n[[Tertullian]] condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting \"the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry.\"<ref>[[Tertullian]], ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Chapter 4.</ref> The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:\n<blockquote>\nGod has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them&nbsp;\u2013 the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.<ref>''[[De spectaculis]]'' Chapter 15.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Popularity==\nPopularity in 2018 of major sports by size of [[fandom|fan base]]:<ref name=\"wa\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html|title=The Most Popular Sports in the World|publisher=World Atlas|date=2018|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=60% style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:center;\"\n! # !!

Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in [[team]]s or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as [[racing]], many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a ''match'') is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a \"tie\" or \"draw\", in which there is no single winner; others provide [[tie-breaking methods]] to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a [[tournament]] producing a [[champion]]. Many [[sports league]]s make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular [[sports season]], followed in some cases by [[playoffs]].\n\nSport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical [[athleticism]] or physical [[dexterity]], with the largest major competitions such as the [[Olympic Games]] admitting only sports meeting this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/sports |title=List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports and Events |publisher=The Olympic Movement|date=2018-11-14 }}</ref> and other organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]] using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports.<ref name=council/> However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as [[mind sport]]s. The International Olympic Committee (through [[Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations|ARISF]]) recognises both [[chess]] and [[Contract bridge|bridge]] as ''bona fide'' sports, and [[SportAccord]], the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, [[draughts]] (checkers), [[Go (game)|Go]] and [[xiangqi]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=World Mind Games |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&idContent=658 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021848/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/multi-sports-games/index.php?idIndex=35&idContent=658 |archivedate=8 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=SportAccord |title=Members |url=http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&idIndex=32 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507073823/http://www.sportaccord.com/en/members/index.php?idContent=644&idIndex=32 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<ref name=sportaccord/>\n\nSport is usually governed by a set of [[regulation of sport|rules]] or [[tradition|customs]], which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring [[goal (sport)|goals]] or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.\n\nRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in [[sports journalism|sport news]]. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with [[spectator sport]] drawing large crowds to [[sport venue]]s, and reaching wider audiences through [[broadcasting of sports events|broadcasting]]. [[Sport betting]] is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.\n\nAccording to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21585012-sportswomen-are-beginning-score-more-commercial-goalsbut-they-still-have-lot-ground |title=Women in sport: Game, sex and match |journal=The Economist |date=7 September 2013}}</ref> The world's most accessible and practised sport is [[running]], while [[association football]] is the most popular spectator sport.<ref name=wa/>\n\n==Meaning and usage==\n===Etymology===\nThe word \"sport\" comes from the [[Old French]] ''desport'' meaning \"[[leisure]]\", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being \"anything humans find amusing or entertaining\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sport&searchmode=none |title=sport (n.) |accessdate=20 April 2008 |first=Douglas |last=Harper |work=Online Etymological Dictionary}}</ref>\n\nOther meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.<ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |publisher=G&C Merriam Company |location=Springfield, MA |page=2206 |year=1967}}</ref> Roget's defines the noun sport as an \"activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement\" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roget's II: The New Thesaurus, Third Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://archive.org/details/rogetsiiinewthes00houg |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-618-25414-9 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe singular term \"sport\" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. \"children taking part in sport\"), with \"sports\" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. \"football and rugby are the most popular sports in England\"). American English uses \"sports\" for both terms.\n\n===Definition===\n{{see also|Game#Definitions}}\n[[File:ChessStartingPosition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The [[International Olympic Committee]] recognises some board games as sports including [[chess]].]]\n[[File:Showjumping white horse.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Show jumping]], an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sport]]\nThe precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by [[SportAccord]], which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including [[association football]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], [[tennis]], [[equestrianism|equestrian sports]], and more), and is therefore the ''de facto'' representative of international sport.\n\nSportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:<ref name=sportaccord/>\n* have an element of competition\n* be in no way harmful to any living creature\n* not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as [[arena football]])\n* not rely on any \"luck\" element specifically designed into the sport.\n\nThey also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as [[rugby union|rugby]] or [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]]), primarily mind (such as [[chess]] or [[Go (game)|Go]]), predominantly motorised (such as [[Formula 1]] or [[powerboating]]), primarily co-ordination (such as [[cue sports|billiard sports]]), or primarily animal-supported (such as [[equestrian sport]]).<ref name=sportaccord/>\n\nThe inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Judicial review of 'sport' or 'game' decision begins |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34320201 |date=2015-09-22}}</ref> Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.\n\nThere has been an increase in the application of the term \"sport\" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as [[video game]]s, also called [[esports]], especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According to [[Council of Europe]], European Sports Charter, article 2.i, {{\"'}}Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.\"<ref>Council of Europe, [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016804c9dbb Revised European Sports Charter] (2001)</ref>\n\n===Competition===\nThere are opposing views on the necessity of [[competition]] as a defining element of a sport, with almost all [[professional sport]] involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.<ref name=sportaccord/>\n\nOther bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, the [[Council of Europe]] include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.\n\nIn order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school [[sports day]]s, although moves like this are often controversial.<ref>{{cite news |last=Front |first=Rebecca |work=The Guardian |title=A little competition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/school-sport-competitive-children-achievement-ambition |date=17 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher=ParentDish |title=Why parents hate school sports day |last=Scrimgeour |first=Heidi |date=17 June 2011 |url=http://www.parentdish.co.uk/2011/06/17/why-parents-hate-school-sports-day/}}</ref>\n\nIn competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their \"result\" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with \"handicaps\" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. In [[gymnastics]] or [[diving (sport)|diving]] the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of sport}}\n[[File:Greek statue discus thrower 2 century aC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] bronze reduction of [[Myron]]'s [[Discobolos]], 2nd century AD.]]\n\nArtifacts and structures suggest [[sport in China]] as early as 2000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/aa032301a.htm |title=Sports History in China}}</ref> Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past.

Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the [[Olympic Games]], which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] called [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/ancient/index_uk.asp |title=Ancient Olympic Games|date=2018-07-30}}</ref>\n\nSports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought increased [[leisure time]], letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent of [[mass media]] and global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes&nbsp;\u2013 all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st&nbsp;century, there has been increasing debate about whether [[transgender]] sportspersons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition [[gender identity]].<ref>''Sport and the Law: Historical and Cultural Intersections'', p. 111, Sarah K. Fields (2014){{ISBN?}}|</ref>\n\n==Fair play==\n===Sportsmanship===\n{{Main article|Sportsmanship}}\n{{See also|Gamesmanship|Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing}}\n\nSportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=sportsmanship |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Sportsmanship}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fish |first1=Joel |last2=Magee |first2=Susan |year=2003 |title=101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent |publisher=Fireside |page=168}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lacey |first=David |date=10 November 2007 |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html |title=It takes a bad loser to become a good winner |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nSportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]], that it's \"not that you won or lost but how you played the game\", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: \"The most important thing... is not winning but taking part\" are typical expressions of this sentiment.\n\n===Cheating===\n{{see also|Match fixing|cheating}}\nKey principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.\n\nParticipants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence of [[gambling]] on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for [[match fixing]], where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.\n\n===Doping and drugs===\n{{main article|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport}}\nThe competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as [[Blood doping|increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means]].\n\nAll sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.\n\n===Violence===\n[[Violence in sports]] involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration. [[Rioting]] or [[hooliganism]] by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.\n\n==Participation==\n===Gender participation===\n[[File:100 metres race winner Sina Schielke (192) and the other Runners - ISTAF 2006 - Berlin, 3 September.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|International level female athletes at [[ISTAF Berlin]], 2006]]\n{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}\n{{see also|Women's sports|Women's professional sports|Women's sports in the United States}}\nFemale participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for [[child development]] and [[physical fitness]].

Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics. Gender balance has been accelerating from a 32% increase in 1973\u201374 to a 63% increase in 1994\u201395.

According to the [[Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus)#Research and education|Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital]], the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including [[concussion]].

As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as ''adapted sports''. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.\n\n===Spectator involvement===\n[[File:1906 Athens stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Spectators at the 1906 unofficial Olympic Games]]\n{{Main article|Spectator sport}}\nThe competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of [[spectator sport]].\n\nBoth amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including [[radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]] and [[internet]] broadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or [[pay-per-view]] television broadcast.\n\nIt is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures. The football [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] attracts a global [[television]] audience of hundreds of millions; the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup Finals|final]] alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700&nbsp;million and the [[2011 Cricket World Cup Final]]  attracted an estimated audience of 135&nbsp;million in India alone.<ref>{{Cite news |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |date=10 April 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |accessdate=1 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803013151/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/CorporateNews/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archivedate=3 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the championship game of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the [[Super Bowl]], has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.<ref name=\"SB15\">{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/super-bowl-sets-viewership-record-161138960.html |title=Super Bowl XLIX was the most-viewed television program in U.S. history |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cbc8df2a-aafd-11e4-81bc-00144feab7de.html |title=Super Bowl most watched television show in US history |work=Financial Times |date=2 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref>\nSuper Bowl Sunday is a ''de facto'' national holiday in America;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanfootballinternational.com/super-bowl-sunday-worldwide-american-football-holiday/ |title=Super Bowl Sunday is a Worldwide American Football Holiday |publisher=American Football International Review |date=1 February 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o2QpA0fGyiIC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=super+bowl+de+facto+holiday#v=onepage&q=super%20bowl%20de%20facto%20holiday&f=false |last1=Markovits |first1=Andrei |last2=Rensmann |first2=Lars |title=Gaming the World: How Sports Are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture |page=94 |date=2010 |accessdate=8 June 2015|isbn=9781400834662 }}</ref> the viewership being so great that in 2015, advertising space was reported as being sold at [[$]]4.5m for a 30-second slot.<ref name=\"SB15\"/>\n\n==Amateur and professional==\n[[File:Volleyball-5 (9786053885).jpg|thumb|Women's volleyball team of a U.S. university.]]\n{{See also|professional sport|amateur sport}}\nSport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a [[wage]] or [[salary]]).

Until the mid-20th&nbsp;century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sports administered by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) if she/he played or supported [[Association football]], or other games seen to be of [[Great Britain|British]] origin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and [[rugby union]] at Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fulton |first=Gareth |last2=Bairner |first2=Alan |year=2007 |title=Sport, Space and National Identity in Ireland: The GAA, Croke Park and Rule&nbsp;42. |url= |journal=Space & Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201374 |via=}}</ref> is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in [[Croke Park]] while [[Lansdowne Road]] was redeveloped into [[Aviva Stadium]]. Until recently, under Rule&nbsp;21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.\n\n[[Nationalism]] is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the [[Football War]]. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.\n\nSport and politics collided in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as the [[Munich massacre]].\n\nA study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5&nbsp;percent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.<ref>{{cite news |title=Will Ohio State's Football Team Decide Who Wins the White House? |author1=Tyler Cowen |author2=Kevin Grier |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html |accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Also, when [[Washington Redskins]] win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the [[Redskins Rule]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2012/11/03/will-redskins-rule-again-determine-outcome-of-presidential-election/ |title=Will Redskins Rule again determine outcome of presidential election? |author=Mike Jones |date=3 November 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2012/10/redskins-rule-mnfs-hirdt-on-intersection-of-football-politics/ |title='Redskins Rule': MNF's Hirdt on intersection of football & politics |work=ESPN Front Row|date=2012-10-30 }}</ref>\n\n===As a means of controlling and subduing populations===\n[[\u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie]], in his essay ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.\n<blockquote>\nDo not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvelous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as na\u00efvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.<ref>[[\u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie]], ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (1549), Part 2</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Religious views==\n[[File:Panathenaic amphora Kleophrades Louvre F277.jpg|thumb|The foot race was one of the events dedicated to Zeus. Panathenaic amphora, Kleophrades painter, circa 500 BC, Louvre museum.]]\nSport was an important form of worship in [[Ancient Greek religion]]. The [[ancient Olympic Games]], called the Olympiad, were held in honour of the head deity, [[Zeus]], and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods.<ref>Gardinier, Norman E., 'The Olympic Festival' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London: MacMillan, 1910, p.195</ref> As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them.\n\nThe practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of [[idolatry]], in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.\"<ref name=Watson1>''Sports and Christianity: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives'', Nick J. Watson, ed. (Routledge: 2013), p. 178.</ref> Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of \"collective pride\" and \"national self-deification\" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.<ref name=Watson1/>\n\n[[Tertullian]] condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting \"the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry.\"<ref>[[Tertullian]], ''[[De spectaculis]]'', Chapter 4.</ref> The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:\n<blockquote>\nGod has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them&nbsp;\u2013 the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.<ref>''[[De spectaculis]]'' Chapter 15.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Popularity==\nPopularity in 2018 of major sports by size of [[fandom|fan base]]:<ref name=\"wa\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html|title=The Most Popular Sports in the World|publisher=World Atlas|date=2018|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=60% style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:center;\"\n! # !!

This was the third season with [[Joe Maddon]] managing the club. After being plagued by futility as the Devil Rays, amassing just a .399 winning percentage over their first 11 years as a franchise, the team finished their first season as the Rays with a record of 97 wins and 65 losses, and won their first of two division titles to date, after having finished higher than last place in the AL East just once in their first 11 seasons (2004). In the postseason, they handily beat the Chicago White Sox 3 games to 1, and beat the defending World-Series champion Boston Red Sox in 7 games in the ALCS to advance to their first world-series in franchise history. They would go on to lose to the Philadelphia Phillies in 5 games. To date, the 2008 season remains the last time the Rays have advanced past the Division Series, losing in the first round to the Texas Rangers in 2010 and 2011, to the Boston Red Sox in 2013, and to the Houston Astros in 2019.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Spring training===\nThe Rays, with their off-season acquisitions and continued prospect development, fostered high hopes both within the organization and from analysts for the team to perform well during the 2008 season.  Their performance on the field during spring training justified those hopes.  On March 23, they won their team-record 15th spring training game, and finished with a record of 18\u20138 with two ties and two cancellations due to rain, along with having the highest winning percentage of all teams in spring training.\n\nThere were lingering questions, however.  Ace pitcher [[Scott Kazmir]] had been dogged with arm soreness all spring, and was placed on the 15-day [[disabled list]], retroactive to March 21.  He was expected to be ready in early May. [[Ben Zobrist]], who had been groomed for a super-utility role, suffered a broken thumb during the second week of spring training. [[Rocco Baldelli]], after missing most of the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2007 season]] with a hamstring injury, was sidelined indefinitely due to chronic fatigue believed to be caused by [[mitochondrial disease]], and placed on the 60-day [[disabled list]] just days before the start of the season.\n\n[[Elliot Johnson (baseball)|Elliot Johnson]], an infielder prospect on the 40-man roster who spent the previous season with the [[Durham Bulls]], made headlines during a game against the [[New York Yankees]] when he crashed into Yankees prospect [[catcher]] [[Francisco Cervelli]] in a play at the plate.  He was tagged out, but the collision led to Cervelli breaking his wrist.  While the Yankee organization said the move was uncalled-for, most analysts claimed that it was a good baseball play.  Johnson himself stated he never intended to hurt Cervelli.  The act is believed to have led to heightened tensions in their next game on March 12, leading to an incident where Yankees outfielder [[Shelley Duncan]] slid with his spikes high into [[Akinori Iwamura]], leading to a fight between Duncan and [[Jonny Gomes]].  During the [[bench-clearing brawl]], [[Melky Cabrera]] punched Rays [[third baseman]] [[Evan Longoria]].  Duncan, Cabrera and Gomes were suspended for three, three, and two games respectively. All three dropped their appeals, and had their suspensions reduced by a game.\n\n[[Pitcher]] [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]], the #1 pick in the 2007 Amateur Draft, made his spring training debut on March 8 (prior to the Elliot Johnson incident), accidentally hitting Francisco Cervelli on the arm before striking out 2 to get through the inning.  His [[fastball]] reached 99&nbsp;mph on radar guns.  After three appearances, he was officially assigned to High-A [[Vero Beach Devil Rays|Vero Beach]] but was expected to advance quickly through the minor leagues.\n\nThe initial starting rotation for the Rays was [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]], [[Matt Garza]], [[Andy Sonnanstine]], [[Edwin Jackson (baseball)|Edwin Jackson]] and [[Jason Hammel (baseball)|Jason Hammel]].\n\n===April===\nApril turned into feast-or-famine for the Rays. The bullpen, which was derided as the worst in baseball in 2007, was the best in the league at the end of the month, with a 2.52 ERA. New closer [[Troy Percival]] saved 5 games, and did not allow a single run.\n\n[[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] was bringing the lumber that made him a superstar in 2007, having six home runs in the first 20 games, but finished the month with 31 strikeouts, and had difficulty getting on base with a batting average of just .200. The bigger surprise has been [[Eric Hinske]]. Appearing in 25 games, he hit .293 with 6 home runs and 15 RBI. On April 22, against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], he was a single away from [[hitting for the cycle]], which would have made him the first Ray to ever accomplish such a feat. For the second year in a row, the Rays won a sweep during the home series at Champion Stadium.\n\n[[Evan Longoria]] was one of the last cuts in spring training, surprising Rays fans. He was called up on April 11 after their chosen third baseman, [[Willy Aybar]], went on the disabled list. After six appearances, he was signed to a six-year, $15 million contract. His future seemed promising for the season, with a .250 average and 3 home runs in April. In one game against the Yankees, Longoria hit a home run that capped a 5-run inning to tie the game, and a few weeks later, he homered off of [[Josh Beckett]] of the Red Sox, which provided a cushion for the team to complete their first sweep of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in franchise history.\n\n[[James Shields (pitcher)|James Shields]], with the absence of [[Scott Kazmir]], became the team's ace pitcher. In six starts, he went 3\u20131, with the one loss coming to the New York Yankees, opposite their ace [[Chien-Ming Wang]]. On April 27, he pitched his first [[complete game]] of his career in a game against the Red Sox, where he allowed only 3 batters to reach base. Just a few days after his career outing, he was named [[American League|AL]] Player of the Week.\n\nAfter their sweep of the Red Sox, the Rays were 14\u201311, which was the latest the team had ever been 3 games over .500 in a season. In 26 games during the month, the Rays went 14\u201312, which marked the first time in franchise history that the team had a winning record for the month of April.\n\n===May===\nAfter winning a series in Baltimore on May 1, the Rays were 16\u201312, the first time ever the team was 4 games over .500.

In the previous game, Red Sox center fielder [[Coco Crisp]] attempted to steal second base, and slid into the base head first. Rays Shortstop [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] who was covering the base on the play, knelt on his left knee while attempting to catch the throw from Catcher [[Dioner Navarro]], which blocked the base and caused Crisp to make contact with Bartlett's leg, jamming Crisp's thumb. Crisp was safe on the play. Crisp stated that Bartlett's actions were \"not something you do. You can do that, but that's shady. And he's not a bad dude, but that was shady. If you going to hurt me, I'm gonna come back and hurt you.\"\n\nIn the same game, Crisp reached base in his next at-bat, and attempted to steal second base once again. On this steal attempt however, Rays second baseman [[Akinori Iwamura]] was covering the bag. Unlike his previous steal attempt, Crisp slid feet first, resembling the way a runner attempts to break up a double play by sliding into the player covering the base. Crisp was out on the play. Rays manager Joe Maddon engaged in a heated argument with Crisp upon Maddon making a mound visit, with Crisp being in the Red Sox dugout at that time. Joe Maddon said after the game's conclusion, \"I was not pleased with the slide. I totally felt there was intent to hurt our middle infielder and that's what I was upset with.

After giving up a leadoff home run, he retired the next three batters, capping off a 6\u20134 win for the Rays in their first playoff game in franchise history, giving them a one-game lead in the 5-game series.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=281002130 Longoria's two homers help Rays power past ChiSox]</ref>\n\nPe\u00f1a was expected to start [[2008 American League Division Series#Game 2, October 3 2|Game 2]], but was scratched before the first pitch. Still, the Rays continued to shine. After starter [[Scott Kazmir]] allowed the bases to become loaded in the 1st inning, and gave up two runs to put the Rays in an early hole, the pitching staff did not allow another run as the Rays' offense came through strong for the second consecutive night. In the 2nd inning, [[Dioner Navarro]] cut the deficit to 2\u20131 on an RBI single. [[Akinori Iwamura]] hit a 2-run home run in the 5th inning to put the Rays ahead 3\u20132. Adding some insurance runs in the 8th inning from three RBI singles by [[Carl Crawford]], [[Rocco Baldelli]], and Navarro, the Rays had a comfortable 6\u20132 lead going into the final inning. [[Chad Bradford]] came in to finish the game off, and did so by striking out [[Jim Thome]] of the White Sox to give the Rays a commanding two games to none lead in the best-of-five series, with a chance to win their first ever playoff series, and a trip to the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in Game 3 as the series moved to Chicago.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081003&content_id=3587385&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Never counted out, Rays take Game 2]</ref>\n\nThe Rays looked to be in shape to win the series early in [[2008 American League Division Series#Game 3, October 5 2|Game 3]], after Akinori Iwamura hit an infield single to bring in the game's first run, but starter [[Matt Garza]] allowed the White Sox to tie the game in the 3rd inning, and then take a 4\u20131 lead in the 4th inning. [[Juan Uribe]] of the White Sox added an RBI single in the 6th inning to increase the lead for Chicago. [[B.J. Upton]] hit a 2-run home run for the Rays in the 7th inning to make the game a bit closer, but the Rays could not get their bats going enough.

[[Cliff Floyd]] added an RBI double, followed by a Dioner Navarro RBI single in the 4th inning put the Rays ahead by 4 runs. [[Paul Konerko]] put the White Sox on the board with a solo home run in the 4th inning, but was answered in the 5th inning by a Carlos Pe\u00f1a single that scored one run, giving the Rays a 5\u20131 lead. [[Jermaine Dye]] had a solo home run in the 6th inning, but once again the Rays answered back with another RBI single by Pe\u00f1a in the 7th inning. Grant Balfour came in to close the game and struck out [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] to end the game, and in their first playoff series in franchise history, the Rays took the series three games to one, and advanced to the [[American League Championship Series]].<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081006&content_id=3597628&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Rays clinch, punch ticket to ALCS]</ref>\n\n====American League Championship Series: vs. [[Boston Red Sox]]====\n{{details|2008 American League Championship Series}}\nThe Rays' next round opponent was their division rivals, the Boston Red Sox. Boston won the American League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]], and advanced to the ALCS by defeating the team who had finished the regular season with the best record in baseball, the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], three games to one in their ALDS series. The Rays won the season series against the Red Sox 10\u20138. In those 18 games, the visiting team won only three times.\n\nIn [[2008 ALCS#Game 1|Game 1]] neither team scored until the 5th inning when [[Jed Lowrie]] of the Red Sox hit a sacrifice fly that scored a run from third base. Red Sox starter [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]] held a [[no-hitter]] through six innings until a hit by [[Carl Crawford]] leading off the 7th inning. Following Crawford's base hit, [[Cliff Floyd]] singled, advancing Crawford to a scoring position. However, the Rays could not capitalize as the next three batters were retired to end the inning. In the 8th inning, [[Kevin Youkilis]] hit a fly ball to left field for the Red Sox, which went off the end of Carl Crawford's glove, scoring [[Dustin Pedroia]] from first base and giving the Red Sox a 2\u20130 lead. The 8th inning for the Rays saw the first two batter reach base to send [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] to the plate with none out. With three balls and no strikes, Rays manager Joe Maddon gave Pena the green light to swing away, a move which backfired as Pe\u00f1a flew out to right field. [[Evan Longoria]] then grounded into an inning ending double play. The Red Sox held on to their lead and shut out the Rays by a score of 2\u20130, taking the first game of the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081010&content_id=3609518&vkey=news_tb&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Missed chances haunt Rays]</ref>\n\nWhile the first game of the series was a pitchers' duel, [[2008 ALCS#Game 2|Game 2]] was the exact opposite. The scoring opened up quickly, as the Red Sox put on a 2-out rally against Rays starter [[Scott Kazmir]] in the 1st inning from a [[Jason Bay]] double that scored Kevin Youkilis and [[David Ortiz]] to put the Red Sox up 2\u20130. The Rays answered in their half of the 1st inning off Red Sox starter [[Josh Beckett]], with a 2-out home run by Evan Longoria which also brought in Carlos Pe\u00f1a, evening the game at 2\u20132. Dustin Pedroia hit a solo home run to left field in the 3rd inning, which was again answered by the Rays with [[B.J. Upton]] hitting a solo home run of his own to left field to tie the game back up at 3\u20133. Carl Crawford hit a single to score Evan Longoria, and the Rays took their first lead of the night at 4\u20133. Cliff Floyd went deep to center field in the 4th inning to give the Rays a 5\u20133 lead. The Red Sox hit three solo home runs in the 5th inning, including Dustin Pedroia for his second long ball of the night, Kevin Youkilis, and Jason Bay, respectively, putting the Red Sox back on top at 6\u20135.  The Rays also scored three separate times in the 5th inning, off of a single from Carlos Pe\u00f1a, a double by Evan Longoria, and a single by Carl Crawford, retaking the lead at 8\u20136. The Red Sox did not go away quietly as Jason Bay hit a bases-loaded single to center field and cut the Rays' lead to 8\u20137. With [[Dan Wheeler]] in to pitch for the Rays in the 8th, a wild pitch scored Dustin Pedroia from third base to again tie the game at 8\u20138. The game went extra innings, where in the 11th inning, and Dan Wheeler still pitching for the Rays, walked a batter with one out, and rookie [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] came in for the Rays. Price walked the first batter he faced but stuck out [[Mark Kotsay]], and was able to get [[Coco Crisp]] to ground into a force out at second base. For the Rays in the 11th inning, [[Dioner Navarro]] walked to lead off, and [[Fernando Perez (baseball)|Fernando Perez]] came in to pinch run. [[Ben Zobrist]] then walked, and a ground out by [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] advanced the runners. The Red Sox intentionally walked [[Akinori Iwamura]] to set up a double play chance, but B.J. Upton hit a fly ball to right field deep enough to score Fernando Perez from third base on a sacrifice fly, ending the game in the Rays' favor 9\u20138, knotting the series at one game each as the series shifted to [[Fenway Park]] for the next three games. The time that the game took to complete was 5 hours and 27 minutes.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081011&content_id=3612260&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Worth the wait: Rays even up ALCS]</ref>\n\n[[2008 ALCS#Game 3|Game 3]] did play out very well for the Rays. Red Sox starter [[Jon Lester]] threw four pitches in the 1st inning, but gave up one run in the 2nd inning to put his team in an early hole. In the 3rd inning, the Rays distanced themselves from their opponents. B.J. Upton hit a 3-run home run, and two batters later, Evan Longoria added a solo home run to put the Rays up 5\u20130 in Boston. Rays starter [[Matt Garza]] held the Red Sox scoreless until a sacrifice fly scored a run in the 7th inning, the Rays still having a 5\u20131 advantage. [[Rocco Baldelli]] and Carlos Pe\u00f1a put the final nails in the Red Sox' coffin as far as Game 3 was concerned, Baldelli with a 3-run home run, and Pe\u00f1a with a solo shot in the 8th and 9th innings, respectively. The Rays won 9\u20131, taking a two games to one lead in the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081013&content_id=3617151&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Monster inning wins Game 3 for Rays]</ref>\n\nIt was more of the same for Tampa Bay in [[2008 ALCS#Game 4|Game 4]], jumping out to a 3\u20130 lead in the 1st inning on Red Sox starter [[Tim Wakefield]] with a 2-run home run by Carlos Pe\u00f1a, immediately followed by a solo home run by Evan Longoria. [[Willy Aybar]] added a 2-run home run of his own in the 3rd inning to make it 5\u20130. [[Kevin Cash]] put the Red Sox on the board in the bottom half of the 3rd inning with a solo home run. The Rays however, were not finished with their offensive explosion, putting together a lead of 11\u20131 through six innings. The Red Sox scored a run in the 8th inning, causing Rays manager [[Joe Maddon]] to pull starter [[Andy Sonnanstine]]. Both teams scored two runs in the 8th inning, but the Rays' lead proved to be insurmountable for the Red Sox, and they won by a final score of 13\u20134.\n\n[[2008 ALCS#Game 5|Game 5]], for the longest time, looked as if it was going to be the clinching win for the Rays. B.J. Upton hit a two-run home run in the 1st inning to make it 2\u20130. Carlos Pe\u00f1a hit one of his own in the 3rd inning, immediately followed by a home run by Evan Longoria, giving the Rays a 5\u20130 lead. Upton double in the 7th inning, scoring two more runs, increasing the lead to 7\u20130. In the bottom half of the 7th inning, with Rays starter Scott Kazmir having been removed from the game by manager Joe Maddon, the Red Sox began to rally. Boston scored four runs in that inning via a Dustin Pedroia RBI single, and a 3-run home run by David Ortiz which cut the Rays' lead to 7\u20134. With the Rays' bats quiet in the 8th inning, [[J. D. Drew]] hit a 2-run home run to bring the Red Sox within one run, and Coco Crisp singled home the tying run to make the score even at 7\u20137. In the 9th inning, with the score still tied and two out, Kevin Youkilis hit a ground ball to Rays third baseman Evan Longoria who made an errant throw which allowed Youkilis to advance to second base. After an intentional walk issued by the Rays, J. D. Drew came up big for Boston once again, sailing a fly ball over the head of right fielder [[Gabe Gross]] which fell to the ground and then bounced over the right field wall, scoring Youkilis on the ground rule double and capping off the largest comeback by a team facing elimination in postseason history. The Rays series lead was now down to only one game heading into Game 6, but returned home as the series shifted back to Tropicana Field.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081016&content_id=3625190&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Rays unable to finish off Red Sox]</ref>\n\n[[2008 ALCS#Game 6|Game 6]] began well for the Rays, with B.J. Upton continuing his postseason emergence with a solo home run in the 1st inning and giving the Rays the first lead of the night. The Red Sox returned that with a solo home run by Kevin Youkilis, leveling the score at 1\u20131. Youkilis gave the Red Sox the lead in the 3rd inning by grounding out, but scoring Dustin Pedroia from third base. In the 5th inning, Jason Bartlett hit his second home run of the entire season, another solo shot which tied the game at 2\u20132. Again, Boston quickly answered back, with a solo home run by captain [[Jason Varitek]], his first base hit of the ALCS, Boston now having a 3\u20132 lead. Later in the inning, Coco Crisp singled, and in the next at-bat, Jason Bartlett committed a throwing error to First Base, allowing Crisp to advance to third base. David Ortiz then hit a single to give the Red Sox a 4\u20132 cushion, having scored Crisp. The Rays were unable to make a comeback, and lost the game by that score, their series lead now erased as a Game 7 had to be played to decide the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081018&content_id=3629432&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb No time to dwell on loss for Rays]</ref>\n\nThe starting pitchers of [[2008 ALCS#Game 7|Game 7]] were Jon Lester of the Red Sox, and Matt Garza of the Rays, a rematch of Game 3. Lester, who was the losing pitcher in Game 3, had never lost consecutive outings in his career. Dustin Pedroia wasted no time, homering off of Garza in the 1st inning for the early 1\u20130 lead in favor of Boston. After that, Garza was almost unhittable until his departure. Lester was also great early, retiring the first nine batters he faced before allowing a single in the 4th inning. Later in the inning, Evan Longoria dropped a double into right field, and scored Carlos Pe\u00f1a all the way from 1st Base to tie the game at 1\u20131. Rocco Baldelli knocked a single into left field in the 5th inning, scoring Willy Aybar from second base and putting the Rays ahead for the first time in the game, 2\u20131. With one out the 6th inning for the Red Sox, with Dustin Pedroia on first base and David Ortiz at the plate, Matt Garza was able to get \"Big Papi\" to swing and miss for the strikeout, and Dioner Navarro gunned down Pedroia at second base, who was attempting to steal on the pitch, ending that half of the inning. Willy Aybar belt a solo home run for the Rays in the 7th inning to give them a slightly more comfortable lead at 3\u20131. Garza was removed with one out in the 8th inning, having allowed only two hits and striking out nine batters, and receiving a standing ovation from Rays fans at the game as he left the field. The defending world champion Red Sox did not go away though, loading the bases in that inning. Joe Maddon elected to go with rookie David Price in hopes of ending the threat. Price did just that by striking out J. D. Drew on a check swing. Price returned to close out the game in the 9th inning, and after two strikeouts and a walk, Jed Lowrie hit a ground ball to Rays second baseman Akinori Iwamura, who stepped on second base to make the final out and send the Tampa Bay Rays to their first World Series in franchise history, defeating the Boston Red Sox four games to three. Garza, who had won two games in the series, was named [[ALCS MVP]].<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081019&content_id=3631606&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Magnificent 7: Rays amaze, top Sox]</ref>\n\n====World Series: vs. [[Philadelphia Phillies]]====\n{{details|2008 World Series}}\nThe Rays now stood only four wins from their first world championship, with only the Phillies in their way. Philadelphia won the [[NL East]] division title, disposed of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in their division series in four games, and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2008 NLCS|NLCS]] in five games. The Rays had home field advantage because of the American League's win in the [[2008 MLB All-Star Game|2008 All-Star Game]].\n\n=====Game 1=====\n[[File:October 22, 2008 World Series Game 1.jpg|thumb|right|The teams on the field before Game 1]]\nIn [[2008 World Series#Game one|Game 1]], Rays starting pitcher [[Scott Kazmir]] did not get off to a good start to the Rays' first ever World Series game, giving up a 2-run home run to the Phillies' [[Chase Utley]] in the 1st inning. The Rays had a chance to get on the scoreboard in the 3rd inning with the bases loaded and one out, but did not score as [[B.J. Upton]] hit into a double play. The Phillies added another run in the 4th inning on an RBI groundout, jumping out to a 3\u20130 lead. [[Carl Crawford]] the longest tenured Ray on the team's roster, gave the Rays their first run in World Series history, by hitting a solo home run off of Phillies' starter [[Cole Hamels]] in the 4th inning, cutting the deficit of 3\u20131. In the 5th inning, [[Akinori Iwamura]] hit an RBI double to bring the Rays within one. The Rays were not able to put up any more offense, with the Phillies relief pitchers retiring the Rays' last six batters and winning the game 3\u20132, taking the first game of the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081022&content_id=3637025&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Rays in familiar spot after narrow loss]</ref>\n\n=====Game 2=====\n[[2008 World Series#Game two|Game 2]], saw an impressive performance by the Rays' [[James Shields (baseball)|\"Big Game James\" Shields]]. In this game, it was the Rays taking a 2\u20130 lead in the 1st inning, on two consecutive RBI groundouts, each scoring a runner from third base. In the 3rd inning, B.J. Upton singled home [[Dioner Navarro]], with [[Rocco Baldelli]] being thrown out at home plate after the score, giving the Rays a 3\u20130 lead. Shields was taken out of the game in the 6th inning after getting into a jam, but he did not give up any runs to the Phillies in the game. [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] eventually came into the game for the Rays in the 7th inning, and allowed the Phillies to get on the scoreboard from a solo home run by pinch-hitter [[Eric Bruntlett]] to make the score 4\u20131 with the Rays still ahead. Price finished the game, with the Phillies making it interesting by scoring a runner from second base because of an error by Rays' third baseman [[Evan Longoria]], who deflected the ball into shallow left field. Already with one out, Price then struck out Chase Utley, and retired [[Ryan Howard]] on a groundout to end the game and give the Rays the 4\u20132 win. The series moved to Philadelphia and [[Citizens Bank Park]], tied at one game for each team.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081023&content_id=3639298&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb New life for Rays after Game 2 victory]</ref>\n\n=====Game 3=====\nWith the start of [[2008 World Series#Game three|Game 3]] delayed by rain for an hour and 31 minutes, the series finally resumed in Philadelphia just after 10 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]. [[Jamie Moyer]] became the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game, facing off against ALCS MVP [[Matt Garza]]. Philadelphia was on the board early, as Chase Utley was put out on a ground ball that scored a runner from third. The Rays evened the game at one run each in the 2nd inning as [[Gabe Gross]] flew out on a sacrifice fly. The Phillies took back the back in the 2nd inning after a solo home run by [[Carlos Ruiz (baseball)|Carlos Ruiz]]. The Phillies made it 4\u20131 in the 6th inning from back-to-back home runs by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Gabe Gross scored Carl Crawford by grounding out, and [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] did the same to score Dioner Navarro during the next at-bat to make the score 4\u20133 Philadelphia. In the 8th inning for the Rays, B.J. Upton singled to reach base. During Evan Longoria's at-bat, Upton stole second base, and later steal third base in the same at-bat. Trying to throw out Upton at third base, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz made a throwing error which allowed Upton to score and tie the game at 4\u20134. The 9th inning went sour for the Rays defensively, as Phillies batter Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch. When Bruntlett attempted to steal second base, Rays catcher Dioner Navarro made a throwing error which allowed Bruntlett to advance to third base. The Rays intentionally walked the next two batters, which loaded the bases with no outs. Carlos Ruiz hit a soft ground ball down the third base line, which was fielded cleanly by Rays third baseman Evan Longoria, but trying to toss to Navarro at home to make a forceout, sailed the throw over the catcher's head, and the winning run was scored by the Phillies to win the game 5\u20134, and take a two games to one series lead. Because of the game's late start, it was not completed until 1:47 am EST.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081026&content_id=3645815&vkey=news_tb&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Night to remember in Philly]</ref>\n\n=====Game 4=====\nThe Phillies scored in the 1st inning of [[2008 World Series#Game four|Game 4]] on a bases-loaded walk, and never looked back. [[Pedro Feliz]] drove in a run in the 3rd inning to make it a 2\u20130 Phillies lead. In the 4th inning, Carl Crawford hit a solo home run to cut the deficit in half to just one run for the Rays, but in the bottom half of the inning, Ryan Howard knocked a 3-run home run to make it a 5\u20131 game. [[Eric Hinske]] hit a solo home run to make it 5\u20132, but Phillies pitcher [[Joe Blanton]] hit a solo home run of his own to make it 6\u20132. In the 8th inning for the Phillies, [[Jayson Werth]] and Ryan Howard each hit 2-run home runs, finishing off the Rays in the most one-sided game the series had seen by a score of 10\u20132. The Phillies now had the Rays on the ropes, needing just one more win to become World Champions.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081026&content_id=3646121&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Stakes are Rays'd after Game 4 loss]</ref>\n\n=====Game 5=====\n[[2008 World Series#Game five|Game 5]] was perhaps the most interesting game of the series. The Phillies scored in the 1st inning again, on a bases-loaded single by [[Shane Victorino]] to make it 2\u20130. Evan Longoria scored Carlos Pe\u00f1a to make it a 2\u20131 game.\n\nAt one point, it began to rain, and the weather conditions got worse as the game continued. There was much speculation, including that from [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox baseball]] commentators [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]], that the game may be called early because of the weather. Major League Baseball rules state that the game could have been called after the 5th inning, ending the game and resulting in the Phillies winning the World Series. MLB commissioner [[Bud Selig]] had made it clear to both teams prior to the game anyway, that the game was not going to be called early under any circumstance, as he would not allow such an important game like this to be ended before the 9th inning. However, such a controversy was prevented from happening because of the events on the field, when in the 6th inning, Carlos Pe\u00f1a scored B.J. Upton to tie the game at 2\u20132.\n\nFollowing the completion of the top of the 6th inning, the tarps were pulled over the infield, and the game was delayed until 11:10 pm EST, when it was officially announced that the game was suspended, making it the first time ever for a World Series game. It was not resumed the next day, as it continued to rain in Philadelphia, but the day following that, the game resumed.\n\nThe Phillies had scored in the 1st inning in each game of the World Series in Philadelphia, and essentially did the same again as Jayson Werth singled on a pop up that scored a run in the bottom of the 6th inning to give the Phillies a 3\u20132 lead. [[Rocco Baldelli]] kept the Rays in it with a solo home run in the 7th inning to tie the game again. Pedro Feliz answered that home run with an RBI single that ended up being the game winner, as Phillies closer [[Brad Lidge]] struck out Eric Hinske in the 9th inning to end the game. The Philadelphia Phillies had defeated the Rays four games to one to win their second World Series title, and first since {{wsy|1980}}, and the first championship for the city of Philadelphia since the [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] swept the [[1983 NBA Finals]].

This was the third season with [[Joe Maddon]] managing the club. After being plagued by futility as the Devil Rays, amassing just a .399 winning percentage over their first 11 years as a franchise, the team finished their first season as the Rays with a record of 97 wins and 65 losses, and won their first of two division titles to date, after having finished higher than last place in the AL East just once in their first 11 seasons (2004). In the postseason, they handily beat the Chicago White Sox 3 games to 1, and beat the defending World-Series champion Boston Red Sox in 7 games in the ALCS to advance to their first world-series in franchise history. They would go on to lose to the Philidelphia Phillies in 5 games. To date, the 2008 season remains the last time the Rays have advanced past the Division Series, losing in the first round to the Texas Rangers in 2010 and 2011, to the Boston Red Sox in 2013, and to the Houston Astros in 2019.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Spring training===\nThe Rays, with their off-season acquisitions and continued prospect development, fostered high hopes both within the organization and from analysts for the team to perform well during the 2008 season.  Their performance on the field during spring training justified those hopes.  On March 23, they won their team-record 15th spring training game, and finished with a record of 18\u20138 with two ties and two cancellations due to rain, along with having the highest winning percentage of all teams in spring training.\n\nThere were lingering questions, however.  Ace pitcher [[Scott Kazmir]] had been dogged with arm soreness all spring, and was placed on the 15-day [[disabled list]], retroactive to March 21.  He was expected to be ready in early May. [[Ben Zobrist]], who had been groomed for a super-utility role, suffered a broken thumb during the second week of spring training. [[Rocco Baldelli]], after missing most of the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|2007 season]] with a hamstring injury, was sidelined indefinitely due to chronic fatigue believed to be caused by [[mitochondrial disease]], and placed on the 60-day [[disabled list]] just days before the start of the season.\n\n[[Elliot Johnson (baseball)|Elliot Johnson]], an infielder prospect on the 40-man roster who spent the previous season with the [[Durham Bulls]], made headlines during a game against the [[New York Yankees]] when he crashed into Yankees prospect [[catcher]] [[Francisco Cervelli]] in a play at the plate.  He was tagged out, but the collision led to Cervelli breaking his wrist.  While the Yankee organization said the move was uncalled-for, most analysts claimed that it was a good baseball play.  Johnson himself stated he never intended to hurt Cervelli.  The act is believed to have led to heightened tensions in their next game on March 12, leading to an incident where Yankees outfielder [[Shelley Duncan]] slid with his spikes high into [[Akinori Iwamura]], leading to a fight between Duncan and [[Jonny Gomes]].  During the [[bench-clearing brawl]], [[Melky Cabrera]] punched Rays [[third baseman]] [[Evan Longoria]].  Duncan, Cabrera and Gomes were suspended for three, three, and two games respectively. All three dropped their appeals, and had their suspensions reduced by a game.\n\n[[Pitcher]] [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]], the #1 pick in the 2007 Amateur Draft, made his spring training debut on March 8 (prior to the Elliot Johnson incident), accidentally hitting Francisco Cervelli on the arm before striking out 2 to get through the inning.  His [[fastball]] reached 99&nbsp;mph on radar guns.  After three appearances, he was officially assigned to High-A [[Vero Beach Devil Rays|Vero Beach]] but was expected to advance quickly through the minor leagues.\n\nThe initial starting rotation for the Rays was [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]], [[Matt Garza]], [[Andy Sonnanstine]], [[Edwin Jackson (baseball)|Edwin Jackson]] and [[Jason Hammel (baseball)|Jason Hammel]].\n\n===April===\nApril turned into feast-or-famine for the Rays. The bullpen, which was derided as the worst in baseball in 2007, was the best in the league at the end of the month, with a 2.52 ERA. New closer [[Troy Percival]] saved 5 games, and did not allow a single run.\n\n[[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] was bringing the lumber that made him a superstar in 2007, having six home runs in the first 20 games, but finished the month with 31 strikeouts, and had difficulty getting on base with a batting average of just .200. The bigger surprise has been [[Eric Hinske]]. Appearing in 25 games, he hit .293 with 6 home runs and 15 RBI. On April 22, against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], he was a single away from [[hitting for the cycle]], which would have made him the first Ray to ever accomplish such a feat. For the second year in a row, the Rays won a sweep during the home series at Champion Stadium.\n\n[[Evan Longoria]] was one of the last cuts in spring training, surprising Rays fans. He was called up on April 11 after their chosen third baseman, [[Willy Aybar]], went on the disabled list. After six appearances, he was signed to a six-year, $15 million contract. His future seemed promising for the season, with a .250 average and 3 home runs in April. In one game against the Yankees, Longoria hit a home run that capped a 5-run inning to tie the game, and a few weeks later, he homered off of [[Josh Beckett]] of the Red Sox, which provided a cushion for the team to complete their first sweep of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in franchise history.\n\n[[James Shields (pitcher)|James Shields]], with the absence of [[Scott Kazmir]], became the team's ace pitcher. In six starts, he went 3\u20131, with the one loss coming to the New York Yankees, opposite their ace [[Chien-Ming Wang]]. On April 27, he pitched his first [[complete game]] of his career in a game against the Red Sox, where he allowed only 3 batters to reach base. Just a few days after his career outing, he was named [[American League|AL]] Player of the Week.\n\nAfter their sweep of the Red Sox, the Rays were 14\u201311, which was the latest the team had ever been 3 games over .500 in a season. In 26 games during the month, the Rays went 14\u201312, which marked the first time in franchise history that the team had a winning record for the month of April.\n\n===May===\nAfter winning a series in Baltimore on May 1, the Rays were 16\u201312, the first time ever the team was 4 games over .500.  Although they suffered a sweep to the Red Sox at [[Fenway Park]] immediately following, they bounced back with a series win against the Blue Jays at [[Rogers Centre]] and a sweep of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Angels]] at Tropicana Field. After a win over the Yankees in extra innings [[Hank Steinbrenner]], Senior Vice President and part-owner of the [[New York Yankees]], expressed his frustration with his team at the time, saying that the Yankees \"got to start playing the way the Rays are playing\", and that he wished the Rays were in a different division. Hank also stated that he was happy for the Rays, but that he wished they played in the [[National League]] instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/rays/2008/05/hank-yanks-need.html |title=Hank: Yanks need to be more like Rays |publisher=Blogs.tampabay.com |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617075726/http://blogs.tampabay.com/rays/2008/05/hank-yanks-need.html |archivedate=June 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a win on [[Memorial Day]], the Rays became the first team in over 100 years to hold the best record in the league through Memorial Day after having the worst record in the league the year before.  The last team to do it was the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] in 1903.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kazmir leads Rays over Rangers 7-3 |url=https://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008May26/0,4675,BBARangersRays,00.html |accessdate=2019-12-22 |work=[[Fox News]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=26 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nCloser [[Troy Percival]] was placed on the disabled list for precautionary measures following his removal from a game in which he felt tightness in his hamstring after striking out a batter and then falling to the ground. Percival threw several warm-up pitches but then left the game.\n\n[[Scott Kazmir]] set a new franchise record for the most wins in one month. Kazmir lost his first start of the season in Boston, but then won his next five starts following that loss, also sporting a 1.22 ERA in all six starts. Because of this, he was named American League Pitcher of the Month.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Topkin |first1=Marc |title=Kaz is AL's Mr. May |url=http://blogs.tampabay.com/rays/2008/06/kaz-is-als-mr-m.html |work=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |accessdate=2019-12-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025015250/http://blogs.tampabay.com/rays/2008/06/kaz-is-als-mr-m.html |archivedate=2008-10-25 |date=2 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Rays finished May with a 34\u201322 record, the best record in the American League, leading the division by one game over the Boston Red Sox, and had their first winning record in the month of May (19\u201310).\n\n===June===\n[[File:Massive fenway brawl.jpg|right|thumb|The Rays and Red Sox brawl at Fenway Park, 2008.]]\n[[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] fractured his left index finger on June 4, and was placed on the disabled list. He returned to the team on June 26, wearing a protective padding outside of his left batting glove to help ease impact. Rays manager Joe Maddon stated that once the Rays finished interleague play, and returned to playing American League teams, he would consider putting Pena in the [[designated hitter]] role to help ease the workload on his left index finger, as the Rays were more concerned about his ability to throw the ball, more than having to swing the bat.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080627&content_id=3014497&vkey=news_tb&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Pena returns to Rays; Zobrist sent down]</ref>\n\nOn June 5 the Rays were involved in a benches clearing brawl at [[Fenway Park]] with the [[Boston Red Sox]] following a series of events leading up from the previous night's game. In the previous game, Red Sox center fielder [[Coco Crisp]] attempted to steal second base, and slid into the base head first. Rays Shortstop [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] who was covering the base on the play, knelt on his left knee while attempting to catch the throw from Catcher [[Dioner Navarro]], which blocked the base and caused Crisp to make contact with Bartlett's leg, jamming Crisp's thumb. Crisp was safe on the play. Crisp stated that Bartlett's actions were \"not something you do. You can do that, but that's shady. And he's not a bad dude, but that was shady. If you going to hurt me, I'm gonna come back and hurt you.\"\n\nIn the same game, Crisp reached base in his next at-bat, and attempted to steal second base once again. On this steal attempt however, Rays second baseman [[Akinori Iwamura]] was covering the bag. Unlike his previous steal attempt, Crisp slid feet first, resembling the way a runner attempts to break up a double play by sliding into the player covering the base. Crisp was out on the play. Rays manager Joe Maddon engaged in a heated argument with Crisp upon Maddon making a mound visit, with Crisp being in the Red Sox dugout at that time. Joe Maddon said after the game's conclusion, \"I was not pleased with the slide. I totally felt there was intent to hurt our middle infielder and that's what I was upset with. There's no place for that when you intentionally try to hurt somebody.\"<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20080604&content_id=2840010&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Rays fall out of first, not happy with Sox]</ref>\n\nThe next night, Rays pitcher [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]] hit Crisp below the waist on the first pitch in Crisp's first at-bat of the game.

On June 27, it was announced that Iwamura's suspension was upheld, while Crisp's was reduced to 5 games, no longer making him the longest suspended player of all involved. Iwamura was unhappy that his suspension was upheld so that he had to miss the first game of the next series against the Red Sox.

The chance to vote began on July 6 after the initial All-Star lineups were announced. Longoria was reported to have received over 9 million votes out of 47.8 million total votes cast.

Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he should have called for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, he was able to get the job done.

The scoring opened up quickly, as the Red Sox put on a 2-out rally against Rays starter [[Scott Kazmir]] in the 1st inning from a [[Jason Bay]] double that scored Kevin Youkilis and [[David Ortiz]] to put the Red Sox up 2\u20130. The Rays answered in their half of the 1st inning off Red Sox starter [[Josh Beckett]], with a 2-out home run by Evan Longoria which also brought in Carlos Pe\u00f1a, evening the game at 2\u20132. Dustin Pedroia hit a solo home run to left field in the 3rd inning, which was again answered by the Rays with [[B.J. Upton]] hitting a solo home run of his own to left field to tie the game back up at 3\u20133. Carl Crawford hit a single to score Evan Longoria, and the Rays took their first lead of the night at 4\u20133. Cliff Floyd went deep to center field in the 4th inning to give the Rays a 5\u20133 lead. The Red Sox hit three solo home runs in the 5th inning, including Dustin Pedroia for his second long ball of the night, Kevin Youkilis, and Jason Bay, respectively, putting the Red Sox back on top at 6\u20135.  The Rays also scored three separate times in the 5th inning, off of a single from Carlos Pe\u00f1a, a double by Evan Longoria, and a single by Carl Crawford, retaking the lead at 8\u20136. The Red Sox did not go away quietly as Jason Bay hit a bases-loaded single to center field and cut the Rays' lead to 8\u20137. With [[Dan Wheeler]] in to pitch for the Rays in the 8th, a wild pitch scored Dustin Pedroia from third base to again tie the game at 8\u20138. The game went extra innings, where in the 11th inning, and Dan Wheeler still pitching for the Rays, walked a batter with one out, and rookie [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] came in for the Rays. Price walked the first batter he faced but stuck out [[Mark Kotsay]], and was able to get [[Coco Crisp]] to ground into a force out at second base. For the Rays in the 11th inning, [[Dioner Navarro]] walked to lead off, and [[Fernando Perez (baseball)|Fernando Perez]] came in to pinch run. [[Ben Zobrist]] then walked, and a ground out by [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] advanced the runners. The Red Sox intentionally walked [[Akinori Iwamura]] to set up a double play chance, but B.J. Upton hit a fly ball to right field deep enough to score Fernando Perez from third base on a sacrifice fly, ending the game in the Rays' favor 9\u20138, knotting the series at one game each as the series shifted to [[Fenway Park]] for the next three games. The time that the game took to complete was 5 hours and 27 minutes.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081011&content_id=3612260&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Worth the wait: Rays even up ALCS]</ref>\n\n[[2008 ALCS#Game 3|Game 3]] did play out very well for the Rays. Red Sox starter [[Jon Lester]] threw four pitches in the 1st inning, but gave up one run in the 2nd inning to put his team in an early hole. In the 3rd inning, the Rays distanced themselves from their opponents. B.J. Upton hit a 3-run home run, and two batters later, Evan Longoria added a solo home run to put the Rays up 5\u20130 in Boston. Rays starter [[Matt Garza]] held the Red Sox scoreless until a sacrifice fly scored a run in the 7th inning, the Rays still having a 5\u20131 advantage. [[Rocco Baldelli]] and Carlos Pe\u00f1a put the final nails in the Red Sox' coffin as far as Game 3 was concerned, Baldelli with a 3-run home run, and Pe\u00f1a with a solo shot in the 8th and 9th innings, respectively. The Rays won 9\u20131, taking a two games to one lead in the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081013&content_id=3617151&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Monster inning wins Game 3 for Rays]</ref>\n\nIt was more of the same for Tampa Bay in [[2008 ALCS#Game 4|Game 4]], jumping out to a 3\u20130 lead in the 1st inning on Red Sox starter [[Tim Wakefield]] with a 2-run home run by Carlos Pe\u00f1a, immediately followed by a solo home run by Evan Longoria. [[Willy Aybar]] added a 2-run home run of his own in the 3rd inning to make it 5\u20130. [[Kevin Cash]] put the Red Sox on the board in the bottom half of the 3rd inning with a solo home run. The Rays however, were not finished with their offensive explosion, putting together a lead of 11\u20131 through six innings. The Red Sox scored a run in the 8th inning, causing Rays manager [[Joe Maddon]] to pull starter [[Andy Sonnanstine]]. Both teams scored two runs in the 8th inning, but the Rays' lead proved to be insurmountable for the Red Sox, and they won by a final score of 13\u20134.\n\n[[2008 ALCS#Game 5|Game 5]], for the longest time, looked as if it was going to be the clinching win for the Rays. B.J. Upton hit a two-run home run in the 1st inning to make it 2\u20130. Carlos Pe\u00f1a hit one of his own in the 3rd inning, immediately followed by a home run by Evan Longoria, giving the Rays a 5\u20130 lead. Upton double in the 7th inning, scoring two more runs, increasing the lead to 7\u20130. In the bottom half of the 7th inning, with Rays starter Scott Kazmir having been removed from the game by manager Joe Maddon, the Red Sox began to rally. Boston scored four runs in that inning via a Dustin Pedroia RBI single, and a 3-run home run by David Ortiz which cut the Rays' lead to 7\u20134. With the Rays' bats quiet in the 8th inning, [[J. D. Drew]] hit a 2-run home run to bring the Red Sox within one run, and Coco Crisp singled home the tying run to make the score even at 7\u20137. In the 9th inning, with the score still tied and two out, Kevin Youkilis hit a ground ball to Rays third baseman Evan Longoria who made an errant throw which allowed Youkilis to advance to second base. After an intentional walk issued by the Rays, J. D. Drew came up big for Boston once again, sailing a fly ball over the head of right fielder [[Gabe Gross]] which fell to the ground and then bounced over the right field wall, scoring Youkilis on the ground rule double and capping off the largest comeback by a team facing elimination in postseason history. The Rays series lead was now down to only one game heading into Game 6, but returned home as the series shifted back to Tropicana Field.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081016&content_id=3625190&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Rays unable to finish off Red Sox]</ref>\n\n[[2008 ALCS#Game 6|Game 6]] began well for the Rays, with B.J. Upton continuing his postseason emergence with a solo home run in the 1st inning and giving the Rays the first lead of the night. The Red Sox returned that with a solo home run by Kevin Youkilis, leveling the score at 1\u20131. Youkilis gave the Red Sox the lead in the 3rd inning by grounding out, but scoring Dustin Pedroia from third base. In the 5th inning, Jason Bartlett hit his second home run of the entire season, another solo shot which tied the game at 2\u20132. Again, Boston quickly answered back, with a solo home run by captain [[Jason Varitek]], his first base hit of the ALCS, Boston now having a 3\u20132 lead. Later in the inning, Coco Crisp singled, and in the next at-bat, Jason Bartlett committed a throwing error to First Base, allowing Crisp to advance to third base. David Ortiz then hit a single to give the Red Sox a 4\u20132 cushion, having scored Crisp. The Rays were unable to make a comeback, and lost the game by that score, their series lead now erased as a Game 7 had to be played to decide the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081018&content_id=3629432&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb No time to dwell on loss for Rays]</ref>\n\nThe starting pitchers of [[2008 ALCS#Game 7|Game 7]] were Jon Lester of the Red Sox, and Matt Garza of the Rays, a rematch of Game 3. Lester, who was the losing pitcher in Game 3, had never lost consecutive outings in his career. Dustin Pedroia wasted no time, homering off of Garza in the 1st inning for the early 1\u20130 lead in favor of Boston. After that, Garza was almost unhittable until his departure. Lester was also great early, retiring the first nine batters he faced before allowing a single in the 4th inning. Later in the inning, Evan Longoria dropped a double into right field, and scored Carlos Pe\u00f1a all the way from 1st Base to tie the game at 1\u20131. Rocco Baldelli knocked a single into left field in the 5th inning, scoring Willy Aybar from second base and putting the Rays ahead for the first time in the game, 2\u20131. With one out the 6th inning for the Red Sox, with Dustin Pedroia on first base and David Ortiz at the plate, Matt Garza was able to get \"Big Papi\" to swing and miss for the strikeout, and Dioner Navarro gunned down Pedroia at second base, who was attempting to steal on the pitch, ending that half of the inning. Willy Aybar belt a solo home run for the Rays in the 7th inning to give them a slightly more comfortable lead at 3\u20131. Garza was removed with one out in the 8th inning, having allowed only two hits and striking out nine batters, and receiving a standing ovation from Rays fans at the game as he left the field. The defending world champion Red Sox did not go away though, loading the bases in that inning. Joe Maddon elected to go with rookie David Price in hopes of ending the threat. Price did just that by striking out J. D. Drew on a check swing. Price returned to close out the game in the 9th inning, and after two strikeouts and a walk, Jed Lowrie hit a ground ball to Rays second baseman Akinori Iwamura, who stepped on second base to make the final out and send the Tampa Bay Rays to their first World Series in franchise history, defeating the Boston Red Sox four games to three. Garza, who had won two games in the series, was named [[ALCS MVP]].<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20081019&content_id=3631606&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Magnificent 7: Rays amaze, top Sox]</ref>\n\n====World Series: vs. [[Philadelphia Phillies]]====\n{{details|2008 World Series}}\nThe Rays now stood only four wins from their first world championship, with only the Phillies in their way. Philadelphia won the [[NL East]] division title, disposed of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in their division series in four games, and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2008 NLCS|NLCS]] in five games. The Rays had home field advantage because of the American League's win in the [[2008 MLB All-Star Game|2008 All-Star Game]].\n\n=====Game 1=====\n[[File:October 22, 2008 World Series Game 1.jpg|thumb|right|The teams on the field before Game 1]]\nIn [[2008 World Series#Game one|Game 1]], Rays starting pitcher [[Scott Kazmir]] did not get off to a good start to the Rays' first ever World Series game, giving up a 2-run home run to the Phillies' [[Chase Utley]] in the 1st inning. The Rays had a chance to get on the scoreboard in the 3rd inning with the bases loaded and one out, but did not score as [[B.J. Upton]] hit into a double play. The Phillies added another run in the 4th inning on an RBI groundout, jumping out to a 3\u20130 lead. [[Carl Crawford]] the longest tenured Ray on the team's roster, gave the Rays their first run in World Series history, by hitting a solo home run off of Phillies' starter [[Cole Hamels]] in the 4th inning, cutting the deficit of 3\u20131. In the 5th inning, [[Akinori Iwamura]] hit an RBI double to bring the Rays within one. The Rays were not able to put up any more offense, with the Phillies relief pitchers retiring the Rays' last six batters and winning the game 3\u20132, taking the first game of the series.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081022&content_id=3637025&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Rays in familiar spot after narrow loss]</ref>\n\n=====Game 2=====\n[[2008 World Series#Game two|Game 2]], saw an impressive performance by the Rays' [[James Shields (baseball)|\"Big Game James\" Shields]]. In this game, it was the Rays taking a 2\u20130 lead in the 1st inning, on two consecutive RBI groundouts, each scoring a runner from third base. In the 3rd inning, B.J. Upton singled home [[Dioner Navarro]], with [[Rocco Baldelli]] being thrown out at home plate after the score, giving the Rays a 3\u20130 lead. Shields was taken out of the game in the 6th inning after getting into a jam, but he did not give up any runs to the Phillies in the game. [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] eventually came into the game for the Rays in the 7th inning, and allowed the Phillies to get on the scoreboard from a solo home run by pinch-hitter [[Eric Bruntlett]] to make the score 4\u20131 with the Rays still ahead. Price finished the game, with the Phillies making it interesting by scoring a runner from second base because of an error by Rays' third baseman [[Evan Longoria]], who deflected the ball into shallow left field. Already with one out, Price then struck out Chase Utley, and retired [[Ryan Howard]] on a groundout to end the game and give the Rays the 4\u20132 win. The series moved to Philadelphia and [[Citizens Bank Park]], tied at one game for each team.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081023&content_id=3639298&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb New life for Rays after Game 2 victory]</ref>\n\n=====Game 3=====\nWith the start of [[2008 World Series#Game three|Game 3]] delayed by rain for an hour and 31 minutes, the series finally resumed in Philadelphia just after 10 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]. [[Jamie Moyer]] became the oldest pitcher to start a World Series game, facing off against ALCS MVP [[Matt Garza]]. Philadelphia was on the board early, as Chase Utley was put out on a ground ball that scored a runner from third. The Rays evened the game at one run each in the 2nd inning as [[Gabe Gross]] flew out on a sacrifice fly. The Phillies took back the back in the 2nd inning after a solo home run by [[Carlos Ruiz (baseball)|Carlos Ruiz]]. The Phillies made it 4\u20131 in the 6th inning from back-to-back home runs by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Gabe Gross scored Carl Crawford by grounding out, and [[Jason Bartlett (baseball)|Jason Bartlett]] did the same to score Dioner Navarro during the next at-bat to make the score 4\u20133 Philadelphia. In the 8th inning for the Rays, B.J. Upton singled to reach base. During Evan Longoria's at-bat, Upton stole second base, and later steal third base in the same at-bat. Trying to throw out Upton at third base, Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz made a throwing error which allowed Upton to score and tie the game at 4\u20134. The 9th inning went sour for the Rays defensively, as Phillies batter Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch. When Bruntlett attempted to steal second base, Rays catcher Dioner Navarro made a throwing error which allowed Bruntlett to advance to third base. The Rays intentionally walked the next two batters, which loaded the bases with no outs. Carlos Ruiz hit a soft ground ball down the third base line, which was fielded cleanly by Rays third baseman Evan Longoria, but trying to toss to Navarro at home to make a forceout, sailed the throw over the catcher's head, and the winning run was scored by the Phillies to win the game 5\u20134, and take a two games to one series lead. Because of the game's late start, it was not completed until 1:47 am EST.<ref>[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081026&content_id=3645815&vkey=news_tb&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Night to remember in Philly]</ref>\n\n=====Game 4=====\nThe Phillies scored in the 1st inning of [[2008 World Series#Game four|Game 4]] on a bases-loaded walk, and never looked back. [[Pedro Feliz]] drove in a run in the 3rd inning to make it a 2\u20130 Phillies lead. In the 4th inning, Carl Crawford hit a solo home run to cut the deficit in half to just one run for the Rays, but in the bottom half of the inning, Ryan Howard knocked a 3-run home run to make it a 5\u20131 game. [[Eric Hinske]] hit a solo home run to make it 5\u20132, but Phillies pitcher [[Joe Blanton]] hit a solo home run of his own to make it 6\u20132. In the 8th inning for the Phillies, [[Jayson Werth]] and Ryan Howard each hit 2-run home runs, finishing off the Rays in the most one-sided game the series had seen by a score of 10\u20132. The Phillies now had the Rays on the ropes, needing just one more win to become World Champions.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081026&content_id=3646121&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Stakes are Rays'd after Game 4 loss]</ref>\n\n=====Game 5=====\n[[2008 World Series#Game five|Game 5]] was perhaps the most interesting game of the series. The Phillies scored in the 1st inning again, on a bases-loaded single by [[Shane Victorino]] to make it 2\u20130. Evan Longoria scored Carlos Pe\u00f1a to make it a 2\u20131 game.\n\nAt one point, it began to rain, and the weather conditions got worse as the game continued. There was much speculation, including that from [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox baseball]] commentators [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]], that the game may be called early because of the weather. Major League Baseball rules state that the game could have been called after the 5th inning, ending the game and resulting in the Phillies winning the World Series. MLB commissioner [[Bud Selig]] had made it clear to both teams prior to the game anyway, that the game was not going to be called early under any circumstance, as he would not allow such an important game like this to be ended before the 9th inning. However, such a controversy was prevented from happening because of the events on the field, when in the 6th inning, Carlos Pe\u00f1a scored B.J. Upton to tie the game at 2\u20132.\n\nFollowing the completion of the top of the 6th inning, the tarps were pulled over the infield, and the game was delayed until 11:10 pm EST, when it was officially announced that the game was suspended, making it the first time ever for a World Series game. It was not resumed the next day, as it continued to rain in Philadelphia, but the day following that, the game resumed.\n\nThe Phillies had scored in the 1st inning in each game of the World Series in Philadelphia, and essentially did the same again as Jayson Werth singled on a pop up that scored a run in the bottom of the 6th inning to give the Phillies a 3\u20132 lead. [[Rocco Baldelli]] kept the Rays in it with a solo home run in the 7th inning to tie the game again. Pedro Feliz answered that home run with an RBI single that ended up being the game winner, as Phillies closer [[Brad Lidge]] struck out Eric Hinske in the 9th inning to end the game. The Philadelphia Phillies had defeated the Rays four games to one to win their second World Series title, and first since {{wsy|1980}}, and the first championship for the city of Philadelphia since the [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] swept the [[1983 NBA Finals]]. Cole Hamels was named MVP of the series.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081028&content_id=3650850&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tb Dream season ends in disappointment]</ref>\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Season standings===\n{{2008 AL East standings|highlight=Tampa Bay Rays}}\n\n===Record vs. Opponents===\n{{2008 AL Record vs. opponents|team=TB}}\n\n==Walk-off wins==\nA key component of the success of the Rays in 2008 was its ability to hang on late in games.
