Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

The most common county name, with 31, is [[Washington County (disambiguation)|Washington County]], for America's first president, [[George Washington]]. Up until 1871, there was a [[Washington County, District of Columbia|Washington County]] within the [[District of Columbia]], but it was dissolved by the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|District of Columbia Organic Act]]. [[Jefferson County (disambiguation)|Jefferson County]], for [[Thomas Jefferson]], is next with 26. The most recent president to have [[Harding County, New Mexico|a county]] named for him was [[Warren G. Harding]], reflecting the slowing rate of county creation since [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] became states in 1912. The most common names for counties not named after a president are [[Franklin County (disambiguation)|Franklin]] (25), [[Clay County (disambiguation)|Clay]] (18), and [[Montgomery County (disambiguation)|Montgomery]] (18).\n\nAfter people, the next most common source of county names are geographic features and locations, with some counties even being named after counties in other states, or for places in countries such as the United Kingdom. The most common geographic county name is [[Lake County (disambiguation)|Lake]]. Words from Native American languages, as well as the names of Native American leaders and tribes, lend their names to many counties.<ref>[[William Bright|Bright, William]] (2004). ''Native American Placenames of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|080613576X}}</ref> Quite a few counties bear names of French or Spanish origin, such as [[Marquette County (disambiguation)|Marquette County]] being named after French missionary [[Jacques Marquette|Father Jacques Marquette]].<ref name=\"Kane 2004 vii-xii\" />\n\nThe county's equivalent in the state of Louisiana, the [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] (Fr. ''paroisse civile'' and Sp. ''parroquia'') took its name during the state's French and Spanish colonial periods. Before the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and granting of statehood, government was often administered in towns where major church [[parish]]es were located. Of the original 19 civil parishes of Louisiana that date from statehood in 1807, nine were named after the Roman Catholic parishes from which they were governed.\n\n==County government==\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe structure and powers of a county government may be defined by the general law of the state or by a [[charter]] specific to that county. States may allow only general-law counties, only charter counties, or both. Generally, general-law local governments have less autonomy than chartered local governments.<ref>[https://ballotpedia.org/General_law_local_government#Total_charter_counties_by_state General law local government], from [[Ballotpedia]]</ref>\n\nCounties are usually governed by an elected body, variously called the [[county commission]], [[board of supervisors]], [[commissioners' court]], [[county council]], [[board of chosen freeholders]], [[county court]], or [[Administrative divisions of New York#County|county Legislature]]. In cases in which a [[consolidated city-county]] or [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] exists, a [[City Council]] usually governs city/county or city affairs. In some counties, day-to-day operations are overseen by an elected [[county executive]] or by a chief administrative officer or [[county administrator]] who reports to the board, the mayor, or both.\n\nIn many states, the board in charge of a county holds powers that transcend all three traditional branches of government. It has the legislative power to enact ordinances for the county; it has the executive power to oversee the executive operations of county government; and it has quasi-judicial power with regard to certain limited matters (such as hearing appeals from the planning commission if one exists).\n\nIn many states, several important officials are elected separately from the board of commissioners or supervisors and cannot be fired by the board. These positions may include [[Clerk (municipal official)|county clerk]], county [[treasurer]], county surrogate, [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], and others.\n\n[[District attorney]]s or state attorneys are usually state-level as opposed to county-level officials, but in many states, counties and state judicial districts have coterminous boundaries.\n\nThe site of a county's administration, and often the county [[courthouse]], is generally called the [[county seat]] (\"parish seat\" in Louisiana, \"borough seat\" in Alaska, or \"[[shire town]]\" in several New England counties). The county seat usually resides in a municipality. However, some counties may have multiple seats or no seat. In some counties with no incorporated municipalities, a large settlement may serve as the county seat.\n\n===Scope of power===\nThe power of county governments varies widely from state to state, as does the relationship between counties and incorporated cities.\n\nThe powers of counties arise from state law and vary widely.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Local Government Law|last=Reynolds|first=Osborne M., Jr.|publisher=West Group|year=2001|edition=2nd|location=St. Paul|page=26}}</ref>\nIn [[List of counties in Connecticut|Connecticut]] and [[List of counties in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392376|title=Connecticut State Register and Manual, Section VI: Counties|publisher=[[Secretary of the State of Connecticut|Connecticut Secretary of the State]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127033757/http://www.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392376|archive-date=November 27, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2010|quote=There are no county seats in Connecticut.

Throughout the United States, counties may contain other independent, self-governing [[municipality|municipalities]].\n\n====Minimal scope====\nIn New England, counties function at most as judicial court districts and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff's departments]] (presently, in [[Connecticut]] only as judicial court districts\u2014and in [[Rhode Island]], they have lost both those functions and all others), and most of the governmental authority below the state level is in the hands of [[New England town|towns and cities]]. In several of Maine's sparsely populated counties, small towns rely on the county for law enforcement, and in [[New Hampshire]] several social programs are administered at the state level. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts, counties are now only geographic designations, and they do not have any governmental powers. All government is either done at the state level or at the municipal level. In Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts, regional councils have been established to partially fill the void left behind by the abolished county governments.<ref group=lower-alpha>Unlike in Massachusetts, Connecticut's regional councils do not conform to the old county lines, but rather, they are composed of towns that share the same geographic region and have similar demographics.</ref> The regional councils' authority is limited compared with a county government\u2014they have authority only over infrastructure and land use planning, distribution of state and federal funds for infrastructure projects, emergency preparedness, and limited law enforcement duties.\n\n====Moderate scope====\nIn the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Midwest]], counties typically provide, at a minimum, courts, [[public utility|public utilities]], libraries, hospitals, [[public health]] services, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails. There is usually a county registrar, recorder, or clerk (the exact title varies) who collects [[Vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]], holds elections (sometimes in coordination with a separate elections office or commission), and prepares or processes certificates of births, deaths, marriages, and dissolutions (divorce decrees). The county recorder normally maintains the official record of all real estate transactions. Other key county officials include the [[coroner]]/[[medical examiner]], [[treasurer]], [[assessor (property)|assessor]], [[auditor]], [[comptroller]], and [[district attorney]].\n\nIn most states, the [[Sheriffs in the United States|county sheriff]] is the chief law enforcement officer in the county. However, except in major emergencies where clear chains of command are essential, the county sheriff normally does not directly control the police departments of city governments, but merely cooperates with them (e.g., under [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] pacts). Thus, the most common interaction between county and city law enforcement personnel is when city police officers deliver suspects to sheriff's deputies for detention or incarceration in the county jail.\n\nIn most states, the [[State court (United States)|state courts]] and local law enforcement are organized and implemented along county boundaries, but nearly all of the substantive and procedural law adjudicated in state trial courts originates from the state legislature and state appellate courts. In other words, most criminal defendants are prosecuted for violations of state law, not local ordinances, and if they, the district attorney, or police seek reforms to the criminal justice system, they will usually have to direct their efforts towards the state legislature rather than the county (which merely implements state law). \n\nA typical criminal defendant will be arraigned and subsequently indicted or held over for trial before a trial court in and for a particular county where the crime occurred, kept in the county jail (if he is not granted bail or cannot make bail), prosecuted by the county's district attorney, and tried before a jury selected from that county. But long-term incarceration is rarely a county responsibility, execution of [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] is never a county responsibility, and the state's responses to prisoners' appeals are the responsibility of the [[state attorney general]], who has to defend before the state appellate courts the prosecutions conducted by locally elected district attorneys in the name of the state. Furthermore, county-level trial court judges are officers of the judicial branch of the state government rather than county governments.\n\nIn many states, the county controls all [[unincorporated area|unincorporated lands]] within its boundaries. In states with a township tier, unincorporated land is controlled by the townships. Residents of unincorporated land who are dissatisfied with county-level or township-level resource allocation decisions can attempt to vote to incorporate as a [[city]], [[town]], or [[village (United States)|village]].\n\nA few counties directly provide [[public transport]]ation themselves, usually in the form of a simple bus system. However, in most counties, public transportation is provided by one of the following: a [[special-purpose district]] that is coterminous with the county (but exists separately from the county government), a multi-county regional transit authority, or a state agency.\n\n====Broad scope====\nIn [[Western United States|western]] and [[Southern United States|southern]] states, more populated counties provide many facilities, such as airports, [[convention center]]s, museums, [[Community centre|recreation centers]],\nbeaches, harbors, zoos, clinics, [[law library|law libraries]], and [[public housing]]. They provide services such as child and family services, elder services, mental health services, welfare services, veterans assistance services, [[Animal control officer|animal control]], [[probation]] supervision, historic preservation, food safety regulation, and environmental health services. They have many additional officials like [[public defender]]s, arts commissioners, human rights commissioners, and planning commissioners. \n\nThere may be a county fire department and a county police department \u2013 as distinguished from fire and police departments operated by individual cities, special districts, or the state government. For example, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]], and its county seat, the city of [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]], each have their own police departments. (A separate county sheriff's department is responsible for security of the county courts and administration of the county jail.) In several southern states, [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] systems are organized and administered at the county level.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|County statistics of the United States}}\n{{Further information|List of United States counties and county-equivalents}}\n{{as of|2016|07|01|alt=As of 2016}}, there were 3,007 counties, [[List of parishes in Louisiana|64 parishes]], [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|19 organized boroughs]], [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|11 census areas]], [[Independent city (United States)|41 independent cities]],{{#tag:ref|Prior to July 1, 2016, there were 42 independent cities.

The most common county name, with 31, is [[Washington County (disambiguation)|Washington County]], for America's first president, [[George Washington]]. Up until 1871, there was a [[Washington County, District of Columbia|Washington County]] within the [[District of Columbia]], but it was dissolved by the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871|District of Columbia Organic Act]]. [[Jefferson County (disambiguation)|Jefferson County]], for [[Thomas Jefferson]], is next with 26. The most recent president to have [[Harding County, New Mexico|a county]] named for him was [[Warren G. Harding]], reflecting the slowing rate of county creation since [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] became states in 1912. The most common names for counties not named after a president are [[Franklin County (disambiguation)|Franklin]] (25), [[Clay County (disambiguation)|Clay]] (18), and [[Montgomery County (disambiguation)|Montgomery]] (18).\n\nAfter people, the next most common source of county names are geographic features and locations, with some counties even being named after counties in other states, or for places in countries such as the United Kingdom. The most common geographic county name is [[Lake County (disambiguation)|Lake]]. Words from Native American languages, as well as the names of Native American leaders and tribes, lend their names to many counties.<ref>[[William Bright|Bright, William]] (2004). ''Native American Placenames of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. {{ISBN|080613576X}}</ref> Quite a few counties bear names of French or Spanish origin, such as [[Marquette County (disambiguation)|Marquette County]] being named after French missionary [[Jacques Marquette|Father Jacques Marquette]].<ref name=\"Kane 2004 vii-xii\" />\n\nThe county's equivalent in the state of Louisiana, the [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] (Fr. ''paroisse civile'' and Sp. ''parroquia'') took its name during the state's French and Spanish colonial periods. Before the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and granting of statehood, government was often administered in towns where major church [[parish]]es were located. Of the original 19 civil parishes of Louisiana that date from statehood in 1807, nine were named after the Roman Catholic parishes from which they were governed.\n\n==County government==\n\n=== Organization ===\nThe structure and powers of a county government may be defined by the general law of the state or by a [[charter]] specific to that county. States may allow only general-law counties, only charter counties, or both. Generally, general-law local governments have less autonomy than chartered local governments.<ref>[https://ballotpedia.org/General_law_local_government#Total_charter_counties_by_state General law local government], from [[Ballotpedia]]</ref>\n\nCounties are usually governed by an elected body, variously called the [[county commission]], [[board of supervisors]], [[commissioners' court]], [[county council]], [[board of chosen freeholders]], [[county court]], or [[Administrative divisions of New York#County|county Legislature]]. In cases in which a [[consolidated city-county]] or [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] exists, a [[City Council]] usually governs city/county or city affairs. In some counties, day-to-day operations are overseen by an elected [[county executive]] or by a chief administrative officer or [[county administrator]] who reports to the board, the mayor, or both.\n\nIn many states, the board in charge of a county holds powers that transcend all three traditional branches of government. It has the legislative power to enact ordinances for the county; it has the executive power to oversee the executive operations of county government; and it has quasi-judicial power with regard to certain limited matters (such as hearing appeals from the planning commission if one exists).\n\nIn many states, several important officials are elected separately from the board of commissioners or supervisors and cannot be fired by the board. These positions may include [[Clerk (municipal official)|county clerk]], county [[treasurer]], county surrogate, [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], and others.\n\n[[District attorney]]s or state attorneys are usually state-level as opposed to county-level officials, but in many states, counties and state judicial districts have coterminous boundaries.\n\nThe site of a county's administration, and often the county [[courthouse]], is generally called the [[county seat]] (\"parish seat\" in Louisiana, \"borough seat\" in Alaska, or \"[[shire town]]\" in several New England counties). The county seat usually resides in a municipality. However, some counties may have multiple seats or no seat. In some counties with no incorporated municipalities, a large settlement may serve as the county seat.\n\n===Scope of power===\nThe power of county governments varies widely from state to state, as does the relationship between counties and incorporated cities.\n\nThe powers of counties arise from state law and vary widely.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Local Government Law|last=Reynolds|first=Osborne M., Jr.|publisher=West Group|year=2001|edition=2nd|location=St. Paul|page=26}}</ref>\nIn [[List of counties in Connecticut|Connecticut]] and [[List of counties in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392376|title=Connecticut State Register and Manual, Section VI: Counties|publisher=[[Secretary of the State of Connecticut|Connecticut Secretary of the State]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127033757/http://www.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392376|archive-date=November 27, 2011|accessdate=January 23, 2010|quote=There are no county seats in Connecticut.

At the other extreme, [[List of counties in Maryland|Maryland counties]] and the county-equivalent [[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]] handle almost all services, including [[public education]], although the state retains an active oversight authority with many of these services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msde.maryland.gov/MSDE/schoolsystems/|title=Direct links to all 24 Maryland Local Education Agencies' web sites|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn most Midwestern and Northeastern states, counties are further subdivided into [[Civil township|townships]] or [[New England town|towns]], which sometimes exercise local powers or administration. Throughout the United States, counties may contain other independent, self-governing [[municipality|municipalities]].\n\n====Minimal scope====\nIn New England, counties function at most as judicial court districts and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff's departments]] (presently, in [[Connecticut]] only as judicial court districts\u2014and in [[Rhode Island]], they have lost both those functions and all others), and most of the governmental authority below the state level is in the hands of [[New England town|towns and cities]]. In several of Maine's sparsely populated counties, small towns rely on the county for law enforcement, and in [[New Hampshire]] several social programs are administered at the state level. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts, counties are now only geographic designations, and they do not have any governmental powers. All government is either done at the state level or at the municipal level. In Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts, regional councils have been established to partially fill the void left behind by the abolished county governments.<ref group=lower-alpha>Unlike in Massachusetts, Connecticut's regional councils do not conform to the old county lines, but rather, they are composed of towns that share the same geographic region and have similar demographics.</ref> The regional councils' authority is limited compared with a county government\u2014they have authority only over infrastructure and land use planning, distribution of state and federal funds for infrastructure projects, emergency preparedness, and limited law enforcement duties.\n\n====Moderate scope====\nIn the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[Midwest]], counties typically provide, at a minimum, courts, [[public utility|public utilities]], libraries, hospitals, [[public health]] services, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails. There is usually a county registrar, recorder, or clerk (the exact title varies) who collects [[Vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]], holds elections (sometimes in coordination with a separate elections office or commission), and prepares or processes certificates of births, deaths, marriages, and dissolutions (divorce decrees). The county recorder normally maintains the official record of all real estate transactions. Other key county officials include the [[coroner]]/[[medical examiner]], [[treasurer]], [[assessor (property)|assessor]], [[auditor]], [[comptroller]], and [[district attorney]].\n\nIn most states, the [[Sheriffs in the United States|county sheriff]] is the chief law enforcement officer in the county. However, except in major emergencies where clear chains of command are essential, the county sheriff normally does not directly control the police departments of city governments, but merely cooperates with them (e.g., under [[Mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] pacts). Thus, the most common interaction between county and city law enforcement personnel is when city police officers deliver suspects to sheriff's deputies for detention or incarceration in the county jail.\n\nIn most states, the [[State court (United States)|state courts]] and local law enforcement are organized and implemented along county boundaries, but nearly all of the substantive and procedural law adjudicated in state trial courts originates from the state legislature and state appellate courts. In other words, most criminal defendants are prosecuted for violations of state law, not local ordinances, and if they, the district attorney, or police seek reforms to the criminal justice system, they will usually have to direct their efforts towards the state legislature rather than the county (which merely implements state law). \n\nA typical criminal defendant will be arraigned and subsequently indicted or held over for trial before a trial court in and for a particular county where the crime occurred, kept in the county jail (if he is not granted bail or cannot make bail), prosecuted by the county's district attorney, and tried before a jury selected from that county. But long-term incarceration is rarely a county responsibility, execution of [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] is never a county responsibility, and the state's responses to prisoners' appeals are the responsibility of the [[state attorney general]], who has to defend before the state appellate courts the prosecutions conducted by locally elected district attorneys in the name of the state. Furthermore, county-level trial court judges are officers of the judicial branch of the state government rather than county governments.\n\nIn many states, the county controls all [[unincorporated area|unincorporated lands]] within its boundaries. In states with a township tier, unincorporated land is controlled by the townships. Residents of unincorporated land who are dissatisfied with county-level or township-level resource allocation decisions can attempt to vote to incorporate as a [[city]], [[town]], or [[village (United States)|village]].\n\nA few counties directly provide [[public transport]]ation themselves, usually in the form of a simple bus system. However, in most counties, public transportation is provided by one of the following: a [[special-purpose district]] that is coterminous with the county (but exists separately from the county government), a multi-county regional transit authority, or a state agency.\n\n====Broad scope====\nIn [[Western United States|western]] and [[Southern United States|southern]] states, more populated counties provide many facilities, such as airports, [[convention center]]s, museums, [[Community centre|recreation centers]],\nbeaches, harbors, zoos, clinics, [[law library|law libraries]], and [[public housing]]. They provide services such as child and family services, elder services, mental health services, welfare services, veterans assistance services, [[Animal control officer|animal control]], [[probation]] supervision, historic preservation, food safety regulation, and environmental health services. They have many additional officials like [[public defender]]s, arts commissioners, human rights commissioners, and planning commissioners. \n\nThere may be a county fire department and a county police department \u2013 as distinguished from fire and police departments operated by individual cities, special districts, or the state government. For example, [[Gwinnett County, Georgia]], and its county seat, the city of [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]], each have their own police departments. (A separate county sheriff's department is responsible for security of the county courts and administration of the county jail.) In several southern states, [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] systems are organized and administered at the county level.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|County statistics of the United States}}\n{{Further information|List of United States counties and county-equivalents}}\n{{as of|2016|07|01|alt=As of 2016}}, there were 3,007 counties, [[List of parishes in Louisiana|64 parishes]], [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|19 organized boroughs]], [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|11 census areas]], [[Independent city (United States)|41 independent cities]],{{#tag:ref|Prior to July 1, 2016, there were 42 independent cities.

The overall modern look and feel of the campus was inspired by the founders' vision of a \"college of the future\" \u2013 intentionally straying far from the traditional \"red-brick\" styles of older universities.\n\nEarly architecture on the campus (late 20th century) exhibits typical characteristics of [[Brutalism]], a popular civic style when the structures were designed and built. In accordance with this style, many of the early buildings are pale, off-white, precast concrete with repetitive structures. Most of these buildings are concentrated towards the north end of the Mall area, the most notable being the Founders Building, Eugene McDermott Library, and Administration Building.\n\nLater architecture (early 21st century) exhibits late modern or [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] features such as bronze glass, bronze aluminum frames, unadorned geometric shapes, unusual surfaces, and unorthodox layouts. This styling is seen in the Engineering and Computer Science building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles). To provide protection from inclement weather and extreme temperatures, many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of elevated indoor walking paths also referred to as [[skybridge]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/pardonourprogress/images/Indoor-Walking-Path-Map.pdf|title=Indoor Walking Path|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Student Services building, completed in 2010, is the first academic structure in Texas to be rated a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum facility by the [[U.S. Green Building Council|United States Green Building Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2011/2/10-8711_UT-Dallas-Building-Awarded-Highest-Green-Status_article.html|title=UT Dallas Building Awarded Highest Green Status|accessdate=February 8, 2011|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref>\n\n=== Landscape ===\n[[File:UTD mall.JPG|thumb|left|The Plinth, located between the McDermott Library (left) and the Student Union (right)]]\nA $30 million Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, largely funded by Margaret McDermott (wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott), was started in October 2008 and completed in late 2010. The project encompassed all aspects of landscape architecture from campus identity to pedestrian strategies, future growth patterns, sustainability and establishing a campus core. The first enhancement included the reforestation of the main entry drive with more than 5,000 native trees. Each tree was hand-picked and individually arranged by the landscape architect after study of native stands in Texas.\n\nThe next major enhancement a included the commitment to a [[Riparian zone|riparian]] corridor, consisting of a densely planted natural creek bed along the central entry median to the campus [[Avenue (landscape)|All\u00e9e]]. The main Mall (or 'All\u00e9e') includes 116 hand-picked columnar 'Claudia Wannamaker' Magnolias alongside five reflecting pools and four human-scale chess boards (to represent the achievements of the school's chess team). At the northern terminus of the Mall (between the McDermott Library and the Student Union) is a pavilion-sized plaza, referred to by many students as \"The Plinth\". The plaza includes a granite fountain complete with mist column, an overhead trellis covered in [[wisteria]] vines, and a temperature-modifying shade structure design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/facilities/files/CLEP-Executive-Summary-Nov-2010.pdf|title=Campus Landscape Enhancement Project\n|accessdate=January 1, 2011|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/enhance/downloads/enhancement-facts.pdf|title=Campus Enhancement Facts|date=April 16, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2010 |publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/president/viewpoint/2010/10/|title=President Viewpoint 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2011|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009021813/http://www.utdallas.edu/president/viewpoint/2010/10/|archive-date=October 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent major phase of the campus landscape upgrades began in 2013, which included to the main pedestrian walkways and corridors on campus, the outdoor space between the Founders and University Theatre buildings, and other areas on campus.<ref name=\"utdallas.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2013/4/9-23011_Regents-Approve-Projects-to-Expand-Enhance-Campus_article-wide.html?WT.mc_id=NewsHomePage|title=Regents Approve Projects to Expand, Enhance Campus| date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=April 9, 2013|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref> As a result of the Campus Enhancement Plan, the University was earned recognition by [[Tree Campus USA]] in the summer of 2017.

Green has become representative several iconic landmarks \u2013 the (former) surrounding cotton field, the (current) on-campus magnolia trees, and the green neon color of the Dallas skyline at night produced from the [[Bank of America Plaza (Dallas)|Bank of America Plaza]] building. The Whoosh (salute) is a way for students to show campus unity.<ref name=\":8\" /> The salute and hand gesture was named the \"Whoosh\" by students because it is the sound a comet would make if there was sound in space.\n\nSome of the traditions that give UT Dallas its distinctive flavor are Homecoming, Annual Oozeball Tournament, Ceremonial Mace, Legacy Lane, Welcome Week, Family Day, Splatterdance, Springapalooza and Cecil Green's Head.

The overall modern look and feel of the campus was inspired by the founders' vision of a \"college of the future\" \u2013 intentionally straying far from the traditional \"red-brick\" styles of older universities.\n\nEarly architecture on the campus (late 20th century) exhibits typical characteristics of [[Brutalism]], a popular civic style when the structures were designed and built. In accordance with this style, many of the early buildings are pale, off-white, precast concrete with repetitive structures. Most of these buildings are concentrated towards the north end of the Mall area, the most notable being the Founders Building, Eugene McDermott Library, and Administration Building.\n\nLater architecture (early 21st century) exhibits late modern or [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] features such as bronze glass, bronze aluminum frames, unadorned geometric shapes, unusual surfaces, and unorthodox layouts. This styling is seen in the Engineering and Computer Science building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles). To provide protection from inclement weather and extreme temperatures, many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of elevated indoor walking paths also referred to as [[skybridge]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/pardonourprogress/images/Indoor-Walking-Path-Map.pdf|title=Indoor Walking Path|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Student Services building, completed in 2010, is the first academic structure in Texas to be rated a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum facility by the [[U.S. Green Building Council|United States Green Building Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2011/2/10-8711_UT-Dallas-Building-Awarded-Highest-Green-Status_article.html|title=UT Dallas Building Awarded Highest Green Status|accessdate=February 8, 2011|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref>\n\n=== Landscape ===\n[[File:UTD mall.JPG|thumb|left|The Plinth, located between the McDermott Library (left) and the Student Union (right)]]\nA $30 million Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, largely funded by Margaret McDermott (wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott), was started in October 2008 and completed in late 2010. The project encompassed all aspects of landscape architecture from campus identity to pedestrian strategies, future growth patterns, sustainability and establishing a campus core. The first enhancement included the reforestation of the main entry drive with more than 5,000 native trees. Each tree was hand-picked and individually arranged by the landscape architect after study of native stands in Texas.\n\nThe next major enhancement a included the commitment to a [[Riparian zone|riparian]] corridor, consisting of a densely planted natural creek bed along the central entry median to the campus [[Avenue (landscape)|All\u00e9e]]. The main Mall (or 'All\u00e9e') includes 116 hand-picked columnar 'Claudia Wannamaker' Magnolias alongside five reflecting pools and four human-scale chess boards (to represent the achievements of the school's chess team). At the northern terminus of the Mall (between the McDermott Library and the Student Union) is a pavilion-sized plaza, referred to by many students as \"The Plinth\". The plaza includes a granite fountain complete with mist column, an overhead trellis covered in [[wisteria]] vines, and a temperature-modifying shade structure design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/facilities/files/CLEP-Executive-Summary-Nov-2010.pdf|title=Campus Landscape Enhancement Project\n|accessdate=January 1, 2011|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/enhance/downloads/enhancement-facts.pdf|title=Campus Enhancement Facts|date=April 16, 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2010 |publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/president/viewpoint/2010/10/|title=President Viewpoint 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2011|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009021813/http://www.utdallas.edu/president/viewpoint/2010/10/|archive-date=October 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent major phase of the campus landscape upgrades began in 2013, which included to the main pedestrian walkways and corridors on campus, the outdoor space between the Founders and University Theatre buildings, and other areas on campus.<ref name=\"utdallas.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/news/2013/4/9-23011_Regents-Approve-Projects-to-Expand-Enhance-Campus_article-wide.html?WT.mc_id=NewsHomePage|title=Regents Approve Projects to Expand, Enhance Campus| date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=April 9, 2013|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}</ref> As a result of the Campus Enhancement Plan, the University was earned recognition by [[Tree Campus USA]] in the summer of 2017.

Green has become representative several iconic landmarks \u2013 the (former) surrounding cotton field, the (current) on-campus magnolia trees, and the green neon color of the Dallas skyline at night produced from the [[Bank of America Plaza (Dallas)|Bank of America Plaza]] building. The Whoosh (salute) is a way for students to show campus unity.<ref name=\":8\" /> The salute and hand gesture was named the \"Whoosh\" by students because it is the sound a comet would make if there was sound in space.\n\nSome of the traditions that give UT Dallas its distinctive flavor are Homecoming, Annual Oozeball Tournament, Ceremonial Mace, Legacy Lane, Welcome Week, Family Day, Splatterdance, Springapalooza and Cecil Green's Head. Cecil Green helped found the University of Texas at Dallas and outside Green Hall there is a bronze bust of Cecil Green. Rubbing Green's head for good luck has become a tradition for many students on their way to exams or presentations. Holiday Sing is one of the oldest traditions on campus, the annual Holiday Sing started in 1976 and is hosted by the School of Arts and Humanities during the month of December. Resting in the courtyard of the Edith A. O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building is the sculpture ''Jack'', created in 1971 by artist [[Jim Love (artist)|Jim Love]] (1927\u20132005).
