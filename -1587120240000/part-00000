Johnson ordered Colonel [[William Rhett]] to engage the notorious [[pirate]] [[Stede Bonnet]]'s [[sloop]]s in the [[Battle of Cape Fear River]] with the Charleston Militia on sea in 1718.  His grandson was South Carolina Congressman [[Ralph Izard]].\n\n==Life==\nHe was the son of Sir [[Nathaniel Johnson (South Carolina politician)|Nathaniel Johnson]], governor of the Province of South Carolina from 1702 to 1708, and inherited a considerable estate from his father. On April 30, 1717, he was commissioned governor of South Carolina. Like his father, he soon won the confidence of the people, but coming at a time when the powers of the proprietors were already tottering, he was baffled in his efforts to conciliate the colonists, by the proprietors' own greed and folly, and in his endeavors to sustain their authority he lost whatever influence he might have exercised.\n\n== Settling the Frontier ==\nDuring his time as governor Johnson oversaw an innovative new approach to settling the South Carolina frontier with the hope of providing a buffer between Native Americans in the west and Charles Towne on the east coast<ref>{{Cite book|title=South Carolina: A Synoptic History for Laymen|last=Jones|first=Lewis P.|publisher=Sandlapper|year=1971|isbn=|location=Orangeburg|pages=52-53}}</ref>. This \"Township Scheme\" was essentially a government subsidized settlement plan that involved the creation of townships which were treated as mini-colonies, each comprising about 20,000 acres. New settlers would be given 50 acres a piece and once a township had reached 100 settlers it would be given two seats in South Carolina's Commons House of Assembly. Townships created under this program were [[Purrysburg, South Carolina|Purrysburg]], [[New Windsor, South Carolina|New Windsor]], [[Fredericksburg, South Carolina|Fredericksburg]], [[Queensborough, South Carolina|Queensborough]], [[Conway, South Carolina|Kingston]], [[St. Matthews, South Carolina|Amelia]], [[Williamsburg County, South Carolina|Williamsburg]], [[Saxe Gotha, South Carolina|Saxe Gotha]], [[Welsh Tract, South Carolina|Welsh Tract]], and [[Orangeburg, South Carolina|Orangebur]]<nowiki/>g.\n\n\n== Pirate Wars ==\nJohnson oversaw the suppression of the pirates who were preying upon the commerce of South Carolina and neighboring colonies. Fitting out an expedition, he personally commanded a victorious engagement with them off the bar of Charleston, and carried on the campaign until they were exterminated and their famous leader [[Stede Bonnet]] was captured and executed.

[[James Moore II]] was thereupon elected governor by the convention, and Johnson was set aside.\n\nNotwithstanding the loyalty thus shown to the proprietors, he was appointed first regular royal governor of the colony in December 1729, and upon his arrival at Charleston, early in 1731, was joyfully received by the people. His administration was marked by the issuance of several acts regarding the granting of land to new settlers, and by a protracted boundary dispute with North Carolina, the two colonies being for the first time constituted entirely separate provinces. He aided [[James Oglethorpe]] in the settlement of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] by providing food and escort to his colonists.

During that time, Indore was established the headquarters of British Central Agency. [[Ujjain]] was originally the commercial centre of Malwa.

User data is interspersed [[In-band signaling|in-band]] with Telnet control information in an 8-bit [[byte oriented]] data connection over the  [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).\n\nTelnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 855, and standardized as [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) Internet Standard [[STD 8]], one of the first Internet standards. The name stands for \"[[Teleprinter|'''tel'''etype]] '''net'''work\".<ref>Andrew Wheen. ''Dot-dash to Dot.Com: How Modern Telecommunications Evolved from the Telegraph to the Internet''.

However, because of serious security concerns when using Telnet over an open network such as the Internet, its use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of [[Secure Shell|SSH]].\n\nThe term ''telnet'' is also used to refer to the software that implements the client part of the protocol. Telnet client applications are available for virtually all [[Platform (computing)|computer platforms]]. ''Telnet'' is also used as a [[verb]]. ''To telnet'' means to establish a connection using the Telnet protocol, either with a command line client or with a graphical interface. For example, a common directive might be: \"''To change your password, telnet into the server, log in and run the [[passwd (command)|passwd]] command.''\" In most cases, a user would be ''telnetting'' into a [[Unix-like]] server system or a network device (such as a router).\n{{IPstack}}\n{{Shubham}}\nShubham surve here\n\n==History and standards==\nTelnet is a  [[client-server protocol]], based on a [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliable]] [[connection-oriented]] transport.  Typically, this protocol is used to establish a connection to [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) [[port number]] 23, where a Telnet server application (telnetd) is listening. Telnet, however, predates TCP/IP and was originally run over [[Network Control Program]] (NCP) protocols.\n\nEven though Telnet was an ad hoc protocol with no official definition until March 5, 1973,<ref>RFC 318 \u2014 documentation of old ad hoc telnet protocol</ref> the name actually referred to ''Teletype Over Network Protocol'' as the RFC 206 (NIC 7176) on Telnet makes the connection clear:<ref>Garth O. Bruen. ''WHOIS Running the Internet: Protocol, Policy, and Privacy''. Wiley, 1st edition (November 2, 2015). p. 25. {{ISBN|9781118679555}}.</ref>\n{{quote |text=The TELNET protocol is based upon the notion of a virtual [[Teleprinter|teletype]], employing a 7-bit [[ASCII]] character set.  The primary function of a User TELNET, then, is to provide the means by which its users can 'hit' all the keys on that virtual teletype.<ref>[http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc0206.txt The RFC 206 (NIC 7176)], 9 August 1971; Computer Research Lab, UCSB; J. White.</ref>}} Essentially, it used an 8-bit channel to exchange 7-bit ASCII data. Any byte with the high bit set was a special Telnet character. On March 5, 1973, a Telnet protocol standard was defined at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]<ref>RFC 495 \u2014 announcement of Telnet protocol</ref> with the publication of two NIC documents: Telnet Protocol Specification, NIC 15372, and Telnet Option Specifications, NIC 15373.\n\nMany extensions were made for Telnet because of its negotiable options protocol architecture. Some of these extensions have been adopted as [[Internet standard]]s, IETF documents STD 27 through STD 32. Some extensions have been widely implemented and others are proposed standards on the IETF standards track (see [[#Related RFCs|below]])\nTelnet is best understood in the context of a user with a simple terminal using the local Telnet program (known as the client program) to run a logon session on a remote computer where the user's communications needs are handled by a Telnet server program.\n\n==Security==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nWhen Telnet was initially developed in 1969, most users of networked computers were in the computer departments of academic institutions, or at large private and government research facilities. In this environment, security was not nearly as much a concern as it became after the bandwidth explosion of the 1990s. The rise in the number of people with access to the Internet, and by extension the number of people attempting to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] other people's [[Server (computing)|server]]s, made encrypted alternatives necessary.\n\nExperts in [[computer security]], such as [[SANS Institute]], recommend that the use of Telnet for remote logins should be discontinued under all normal circumstances, for the following reasons:\n\n* Telnet, by default, does not [[encryption|encrypt]] any data sent over the connection (including passwords), and so it is often feasible to eavesdrop on the communications and use the password later for malicious purposes; anybody who has access to a [[Router (computing)|router]], [[network switch|switch]], [[network hub|hub]] or [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateway]] located on the network between the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by and obtain login, password and whatever else is typed with a [[packet analyzer]].\n* Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure communication is carried out between the two desired [[server (computing)|host]]s and not [[Man-in-the-middle attack|intercepted in the middle]].\n* Several [[vulnerability (computer science)|vulnerabilities]] have been discovered over the years in commonly used Telnet [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s.\n\nThese security-related shortcomings have seen the usage of the Telnet protocol drop rapidly,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poulsen|first1=Kevin|title=Telnet, dead at 35...RIP|journal=Wired|date=2 April 2007|volume=April 2007|issue=2007-04|page=24|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/04/telnet_dead_at_/|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> especially on the public [[Internet]], in favor of the [[Secure Shell]] (SSH) protocol, first released in 1995. SSH has practically replaced Telnet, and the older protocol is used these days only in rare cases to access decades old legacy equipment that does not support more modern protocols.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ylonen|first1=Tatu|title=History of the SSH Protocol|url=https://www.ssh.com/ssh/telnet|website=SSH home page|publisher=SSH Communications Security, Inc.|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> SSH provides much of the functionality of telnet, with the addition of strong encryption to prevent sensitive data such as passwords from being intercepted, and [[public key]] authentication, to ensure that the remote computer is actually who it claims to be. As has happened with other early Internet protocols, extensions to the Telnet protocol provide [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) security and [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]] (SASL) authentication that address the above concerns.  However, most Telnet implementations do not support these extensions; and there has been relatively little interest in implementing these as SSH is adequate for most purposes.\n\nIt is of note that there are a large number of industrial and scientific devices which have only Telnet available as a communication option.  Some are built with only a standard RS-232 port and use a serial server hardware appliance to provide the translation between the TCP/Telnet data and the RS-232 serial data.  In such cases, SSH is not an option unless the interface appliance can be configured for SSH.\n\nTelnet is still used by hobbyists, especially among [[Amateur radio]] operators. The [[Winlink]] protocol supports packet radio via a Telnet connection.\n\n==Telnet 5250==\nIBM 5250 or 3270 workstation emulation is supported via custom telnet clients, TN5250/[[Telnet 3270|TN3270]], and [[IBM System i|IBM servers]]. Clients and servers designed to pass [[IBM 5250]] data streams over Telnet generally do support [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encryption, as SSH does not include 5250 emulation. Under [[OS/400]] (also known as [[IBM i]]), port 992 is the default port for secured telnet.<ref>{{cite web |others=IBM Technote |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1019667 |website=www-01.ibm.com |title=IBM TCP/IP Ports Required for Access for Windows and Related Functions - United States}}</ref>\n\n== Telnet data ==\nAll data [[Octet (computing)|octets]] except 0xff are transmitted over Telnet as is.\n(0xff, or 255 in decimal, is the IAC byte (Interpret As Command) which signals that the next byte is a telnet command. The command to insert 0xff into the stream is 0xff, so 0xff must be escaped by doubling it when sending data over the telnet protocol.)\n\nSome use Telnet client applications to establish an interactive TCP session to a port other than the Telnet server port. Connections to such ports do not use IAC and all octets are sent to the server without interpretation. For example, a user could make an HTTP request by hand by using a [[Command-line_interface|command line]] version of the telnet client to a web server on TCP port 80 as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ telnet www.example.com 80\nGET /path/to/file.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nConnection: close\n</source>\n\nHowever such services are implemented through ''network virtual terminal'' (NVT) rules and Telnet does not handle some of the other NVT requirements, such as the requirement for a bare carriage return character (CR, [[ASCII]] 13) to be followed by a NUL (ASCII 0) character.\n\nThere are other TCP terminal clients, such as [[netcat]] or [[socat]] on UNIX and [[PuTTY]] on Windows, which handle such requirements. Nevertheless, Telnet may still be used in [[debug]]ging network services such as [[SMTP]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[HTTP]], [[FTP]] or [[POP3]], to issue commands to a server and examine the responses.\n\n{{anchor|8-bit data}}Another difference between Telnet and other TCP terminal clients is that Telnet is not [[8-bit clean]] by default. 8-bit mode may be negotiated, but octets with the high bit set may be garbled until this mode is requested, as 7 bit is the default mode. The 8-bit mode (so named ''binary option'') is intended to transmit binary data, not ASCII characters. The standard suggests the interpretation of codes 0000\u20130176 as ASCII, but does not offer any meaning for high-bit-set ''data'' octets.

User data is interspersed [[In-band signaling|in-band]] with Telnet control information in an 8-bit [[byte oriented]] data connection over the  [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).\n\nTelnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 855, and standardized as [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) Internet Standard [[STD 8]], one of the first Internet standards. The name stands for \"[[Teleprinter|'''tel'''etype]] '''net'''work\".<ref>Andrew Wheen. ''Dot-dash to Dot.Com: How Modern Telecommunications Evolved from the Telegraph to the Internet''. Springer, 2011. p. 132. {{ISBN|9781441967596}}.</ref><ref>Christoph Meinel; Harald Sack. ''Internetworking: Technological Foundations and Applications''. X.media.publishing, 2013. p. 57. {{ISBN|3642353916}}.</ref>\n\nHistorically, Telnet provided access to a [[command-line interface]] on a remote host. However, because of serious security concerns when using Telnet over an open network such as the Internet, its use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of [[Secure Shell|SSH]].\n\nThe term ''telnet'' is also used to refer to the software that implements the client part of the protocol. Telnet client applications are available for virtually all [[Platform (computing)|computer platforms]]. ''Telnet'' is also used as a [[verb]]. ''To telnet'' means to establish a connection using the Telnet protocol, either with a command line client or with a graphical interface. For example, a common directive might be: \"''To change your password, telnet into the server, log in and run the [[passwd (command)|passwd]] command.''\" In most cases, a user would be ''telnetting'' into a [[Unix-like]] server system or a network device (such as a router).\n{{IPstack}}\n\n==History and standards==\nTelnet is a  [[client-server protocol]], based on a [[Reliability (computer networking)|reliable]] [[connection-oriented]] transport.  Typically, this protocol is used to establish a connection to [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) [[port number]] 23, where a Telnet server application (telnetd) is listening. Telnet, however, predates TCP/IP and was originally run over [[Network Control Program]] (NCP) protocols.\n\nEven though Telnet was an ad hoc protocol with no official definition until March 5, 1973,<ref>RFC 318 \u2014 documentation of old ad hoc telnet protocol</ref> the name actually referred to ''Teletype Over Network Protocol'' as the RFC 206 (NIC 7176) on Telnet makes the connection clear:<ref>Garth O. Bruen. ''WHOIS Running the Internet: Protocol, Policy, and Privacy''. Wiley, 1st edition (November 2, 2015). p. 25. {{ISBN|9781118679555}}.</ref>\n{{quote |text=The TELNET protocol is based upon the notion of a virtual [[Teleprinter|teletype]], employing a 7-bit [[ASCII]] character set.  The primary function of a User TELNET, then, is to provide the means by which its users can 'hit' all the keys on that virtual teletype.<ref>[http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc0206.txt The RFC 206 (NIC 7176)], 9 August 1971; Computer Research Lab, UCSB; J. White.</ref>}} Essentially, it used an 8-bit channel to exchange 7-bit ASCII data. Any byte with the high bit set was a special Telnet character. On March 5, 1973, a Telnet protocol standard was defined at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]<ref>RFC 495 \u2014 announcement of Telnet protocol</ref> with the publication of two NIC documents: Telnet Protocol Specification, NIC 15372, and Telnet Option Specifications, NIC 15373.\n\nMany extensions were made for Telnet because of its negotiable options protocol architecture. Some of these extensions have been adopted as [[Internet standard]]s, IETF documents STD 27 through STD 32. Some extensions have been widely implemented and others are proposed standards on the IETF standards track (see [[#Related RFCs|below]])\nTelnet is best understood in the context of a user with a simple terminal using the local Telnet program (known as the client program) to run a logon session on a remote computer where the user's communications needs are handled by a Telnet server program.\n\n==Security==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nWhen Telnet was initially developed in 1969, most users of networked computers were in the computer departments of academic institutions, or at large private and government research facilities. In this environment, security was not nearly as much a concern as it became after the bandwidth explosion of the 1990s. The rise in the number of people with access to the Internet, and by extension the number of people attempting to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] other people's [[Server (computing)|server]]s, made encrypted alternatives necessary.\n\nExperts in [[computer security]], such as [[SANS Institute]], recommend that the use of Telnet for remote logins should be discontinued under all normal circumstances, for the following reasons:\n\n* Telnet, by default, does not [[encryption|encrypt]] any data sent over the connection (including passwords), and so it is often feasible to eavesdrop on the communications and use the password later for malicious purposes; anybody who has access to a [[Router (computing)|router]], [[network switch|switch]], [[network hub|hub]] or [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateway]] located on the network between the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by and obtain login, password and whatever else is typed with a [[packet analyzer]].\n* Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure communication is carried out between the two desired [[server (computing)|host]]s and not [[Man-in-the-middle attack|intercepted in the middle]].\n* Several [[vulnerability (computer science)|vulnerabilities]] have been discovered over the years in commonly used Telnet [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]s.\n\nThese security-related shortcomings have seen the usage of the Telnet protocol drop rapidly,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poulsen|first1=Kevin|title=Telnet, dead at 35...RIP|journal=Wired|date=2 April 2007|volume=April 2007|issue=2007-04|page=24|url=https://www.wired.com/2007/04/telnet_dead_at_/|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> especially on the public [[Internet]], in favor of the [[Secure Shell]] (SSH) protocol, first released in 1995. SSH has practically replaced Telnet, and the older protocol is used these days only in rare cases to access decades old legacy equipment that does not support more modern protocols.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ylonen|first1=Tatu|title=History of the SSH Protocol|url=https://www.ssh.com/ssh/telnet|website=SSH home page|publisher=SSH Communications Security, Inc.|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> SSH provides much of the functionality of telnet, with the addition of strong encryption to prevent sensitive data such as passwords from being intercepted, and [[public key]] authentication, to ensure that the remote computer is actually who it claims to be. As has happened with other early Internet protocols, extensions to the Telnet protocol provide [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) security and [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]] (SASL) authentication that address the above concerns.  However, most Telnet implementations do not support these extensions; and there has been relatively little interest in implementing these as SSH is adequate for most purposes.\n\nIt is of note that there are a large number of industrial and scientific devices which have only Telnet available as a communication option.  Some are built with only a standard RS-232 port and use a serial server hardware appliance to provide the translation between the TCP/Telnet data and the RS-232 serial data.  In such cases, SSH is not an option unless the interface appliance can be configured for SSH.\n\nTelnet is still used by hobbyists, especially among [[Amateur radio]] operators. The [[Winlink]] protocol supports packet radio via a Telnet connection.\n\n==Telnet 5250==\nIBM 5250 or 3270 workstation emulation is supported via custom telnet clients, TN5250/[[Telnet 3270|TN3270]], and [[IBM System i|IBM servers]]. Clients and servers designed to pass [[IBM 5250]] data streams over Telnet generally do support [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encryption, as SSH does not include 5250 emulation. Under [[OS/400]] (also known as [[IBM i]]), port 992 is the default port for secured telnet.<ref>{{cite web |others=IBM Technote |url=http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=nas8N1019667 |website=www-01.ibm.com |title=IBM TCP/IP Ports Required for Access for Windows and Related Functions - United States}}</ref>\n\n== Telnet data ==\nAll data [[Octet (computing)|octets]] except 0xff are transmitted over Telnet as is.\n(0xff, or 255 in decimal, is the IAC byte (Interpret As Command) which signals that the next byte is a telnet command. The command to insert 0xff into the stream is 0xff, so 0xff must be escaped by doubling it when sending data over the telnet protocol.)\n\nSome use Telnet client applications to establish an interactive TCP session to a port other than the Telnet server port. Connections to such ports do not use IAC and all octets are sent to the server without interpretation. For example, a user could make an HTTP request by hand by using a [[Command-line_interface|command line]] version of the telnet client to a web server on TCP port 80 as follows:\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ telnet www.example.com 80\nGET /path/to/file.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nConnection: close\n</source>\n\nHowever such services are implemented through ''network virtual terminal'' (NVT) rules and Telnet does not handle some of the other NVT requirements, such as the requirement for a bare carriage return character (CR, [[ASCII]] 13) to be followed by a NUL (ASCII 0) character.\n\nThere are other TCP terminal clients, such as [[netcat]] or [[socat]] on UNIX and [[PuTTY]] on Windows, which handle such requirements. Nevertheless, Telnet may still be used in [[debug]]ging network services such as [[SMTP]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[HTTP]], [[FTP]] or [[POP3]], to issue commands to a server and examine the responses.\n\n{{anchor|8-bit data}}Another difference between Telnet and other TCP terminal clients is that Telnet is not [[8-bit clean]] by default. 8-bit mode may be negotiated, but octets with the high bit set may be garbled until this mode is requested, as 7 bit is the default mode. The 8-bit mode (so named ''binary option'') is intended to transmit binary data, not ASCII characters. The standard suggests the interpretation of codes 0000\u20130176 as ASCII, but does not offer any meaning for high-bit-set ''data'' octets.

{"title_page": "Port (computer networking)", "text_new": "{{short description|Communications endpoint in an operating system}}\n{{about|software communication ports|physical ports|Computer port (hardware)}}\n\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn [[computer networking]], a '''port''' is a communication endpoint. At the software level, within an [[operating system]], a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific [[process (computing)|process]] or a type of [[network service]]. Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the '''port number'''. The most common protocols that use port numbers are the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP).\n\nA port number is always associated with an [[IP address]] of a host and the [[network protocol|protocol]] type of the communication. It completes the destination or origination [[network address]] of a message. Specific port numbers are commonly reserved to identify specific services, so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application. For this purpose, the lowest numbered 1024 port numbers identify the historically most commonly used services, and are called the [[well-known port numbers]]. Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications and are known as [[ephemeral port]]s.\n\nWhen used as a service enumeration, ports provide a [[multiplexing]] service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address. In the [[client\u2013server model]] of application architecture multiple simultaneous communication sessions may be initiated for the same service.\n\n==Port number==\nA port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. For [[Transmission_Control_Protocol|TCP]], port number 0 is reserved and cannot be used, while for [[User_Datagram_Protocol|UDP]], the source port is optional and a value of zero means no port. A [[Process (computing)|process]] associates its input or output channels via an [[Internet socket]], which is a type of [[file descriptor]], with a [[transport protocol]], an [[IP address]], and a port number. This is known as ''binding'', and enables the process to send and receive data via the network. The operating system's networking software has the task of transmitting outgoing data from all application ports onto the network, and forwarding arriving [[network packet]]s to processes by matching the packet's IP address and port number. For TCP, only one process may bind to a specific IP address and port combination. Common application failures, sometimes called ''port conflicts'', occur when multiple programs attempt to use the same port number on the same IP address with the same protocol.\n\nApplications implementing common services often use specifically reserved [[well-known port numbers]] for receiving service requests from clients. This process is known as ''listening'', and involves the receipt of a request on the well-known port and establishing a one-to-one server-client dialog, using the same local port number. Other clients may continue to connect to the listening port; this works because a TCP connection is identified by a tuple consisting of the local address, the local port, the remote address, and the remote port.<ref>{{cite web|last=Postel|first=John|title=RFC 793|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>  The well-known ports are defined by convention overseen by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA). The core network services, such as the [[World Wide Web]], typically use well-known port numbers. In many operating systems special privileges are required for applications to bind to these ports, because these are often deemed critical to the operation of IP networks. Conversely, the client end of a connection typically uses a high port number allocated for short term use, therefore called an [[ephemeral port]].\n\n===Common port numbers===\n{{main|List of TCP and UDP port numbers}}\nIANA is responsible for the global coordination of the DNS Root, IP addressing, and other Internet protocol resources. This includes the registration of commonly used port numbers for well-known Internet services.\n\nThe port numbers are divided into three ranges: the ''well-known ports'', the ''registered ports'', and the ''dynamic'' or ''private ports''.\n\nThe well-known ports (also known as ''system ports'') are those from 0 through 1023.

One common use for this range is for [[ephemeral port]]s.\nPort numbers are very important for networking..\nIf you won't to study ethical hacking,  u need to learn all ports.\n\n==Network behavior==\n[[Transport layer]] protocols, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), transfer data using [[protocol data unit]]s (PDUs). For TCP, the PDU is a [[Transmission Control Protocol#TCP segment structure|segment]], and a [[datagram]] for UDP. Both protocols use a [[Header (computing)|header]] field for recording the source and destination port number. The port numbers are encoded in the transport protocol [[packet header]], and they can be readily interpreted not only by the sending and receiving computers, but also by other components of the networking infrastructure. In particular, [[firewall (networking)|firewall]]s are commonly configured to differentiate between packets based on their source or destination port numbers. [[Port forwarding]] is an example application of this.\n\n==Port scanning==\nThe practice of attempting to connect to a range of ports in sequence on a single computer is commonly known as [[port scanning]]. This is usually associated either with malicious [[security cracking|cracking]] attempts or with network administrators looking for possible vulnerabilities to help prevent such attacks. Port connection attempts are frequently monitored and logged by computers. The technique of [[port knocking]] uses a series of port connections (knocks) from a client computer to enable a server connection.\n\n==Examples==\nAn example for the use of ports is the [[e-mail|Internet mail system]]. A server used for sending and receiving email generally needs two services. The first service is used to transport email to and from other servers. This is accomplished with the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP). The SMTP service application usually listens on TCP port 25 for incoming requests. The second service is usually either the [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP) or the [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) which is used by [[e-mail client]] applications on users' personal computers to fetch email messages from the server. The POP service listens on TCP port number 110. Both services may be running on the same host computer, in which case the port number distinguishes the service that was requested by a remote computer, be it a user's computer or another mail server.\n\nWhile the listening port number of a server is well defined (IANA calls these the well-known ports), the client's port number is often chosen from the dynamic port range (see below).\nIn some applications, the clients and the server each use specific port numbers assigned by the IANA. A good example of this is [[DHCP]] in which the client always uses UDP port 68 and the server always uses UDP port 67.\n\n==Use in URLs==\nPort numbers are sometimes seen in web or other [[uniform resource locator]]s (URLs). By default, HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443, but a URL like <tt><nowiki>http://www.example.com:8080/path/</nowiki></tt> specifies that the [[web browser]] connects instead to port 8080 of the HTTP server.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of port numbers was established by the early developers of the [[ARPANET]] in informal co-operation of software authors and system administrators.\n\nThe term ''port number'' was not yet used at this time. It was preceded by the use of the term ''socket number'' in the early development stages of the network. A socket number for a remote host was a 40-bit quantity.<ref name=rfc36>RFC 36, ''Protocol Notes'', S. Crocker (16 March 1970)</ref> The first 32 bits were similar to today's IPv4 address, but at the time the most-significant 8 bits were the host number. The least-significant portion of the socket number (bits 33 through 40) was an entity called ''Another Eightbit Number'', abbreviated AEN.<ref name=rfc433>RFC 433, ''Socket number list'', J. Postel, N. Neigus (22 December 1972)</ref> Today, ''[[network socket]]'' refers to a related but distinct concept, namely the internal address of an endpoint (used within the node only).\n\nOn March 26, 1972, [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Jon Postel]] called for documenting the then-current usages and establishing a socket number catalog in RFC 322. Network administrators were asked to submit a note or place a phone call, \"''describing the function and socket numbers of network service programs at each HOST''\".<ref>RFC 322, ''Well Known Socket Numbers'', V. Cerf, J. Postel (26 March 1972)</ref>\n\nThis catalog was subsequently published as RFC 433 in December 1972 and included a list of hosts and their port numbers and the corresponding function used at each host in the network. This first registry function served primarily as documentation of usage and indicated that port number usage was conflicting between some hosts for \"''useful public services''\".<ref name=rfc433/>\n\nThe document promised a resolution of the conflicts based on a standard that Postel had published in May 1972 in RFC 349, in which he first proposed official assignments of port numbers to network services and suggested a dedicated administrative function, which he called a ''czar'', to maintain a registry.<ref name=rfc349>RFC 349, ''Proposed Standard Socket Numbers'' J. Postel (30 May 1972)</ref>\n\nThe 256 values of the AEN were divided into the following ranges:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Port number range\n! Assignment\n|-\n|0 through 63\n|network-wide standard functions\n|-\n|64 through 127\n|host-specific functions\n|-\n|128 through 239\n|reserved for future use\n|-\n|240 through 255\n|any experimental function\n|}\n\nThe [[Telnet]] service received the first official assignment of the value 1.\nIn detail, the first set of assignments was:<ref name=rfc349/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Shoshani, E. Harslem (14 July 1971)</ref> and was used with the Initial Connection Protocol (ICP), a component of the [[Network Control Program]] (NCP).<ref name=\":0\">NIC 7104, ''ARPANET Protocol Handbook''</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=ARPANET Protocol Handbook\n|first=Jon|last=Postel\n|author2=Feinler, E.\n|year=1978\n|publisher=Network Information Center\n|location=Menlo Park, CA\n}}</ref> NCP was the forerunner of the modern Internet protocols.

At the software level, within an [[operating system]], a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific [[process (computing)|process]] or a type of [[network service]]. Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers, commonly known as the '''port number'''. The most common protocols that use port numbers are the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP).\n\nA port number is always associated with an [[IP address]] of a host and the [[network protocol|protocol]] type of the communication. It completes the destination or origination [[network address]] of a message. Specific port numbers are commonly reserved to identify specific services, so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application. For this purpose, the lowest numbered 1024 port numbers identify the historically most commonly used services, and are called the [[well-known port numbers]]. Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications and are known as [[ephemeral port]]s.\n\nWhen used as a service enumeration, ports provide a [[multiplexing]] service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address. In the [[client\u2013server model]] of application architecture multiple simultaneous communication sessions may be initiated for the same service.\n\n==Port number==\nA port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. For [[Transmission_Control_Protocol|TCP]], port number 0 is reserved and cannot be used, while for [[User_Datagram_Protocol|UDP]], the source port is optional and a value of zero means no port. A [[Process (computing)|process]] associates its input or output channels via an [[Internet socket]], which is a type of [[file descriptor]], with a [[transport protocol]], an [[IP address]], and a port number. This is known as ''binding'', and enables the process to send and receive data via the network. The operating system's networking software has the task of transmitting outgoing data from all application ports onto the network, and forwarding arriving [[network packet]]s to processes by matching the packet's IP address and port number. For TCP, only one process may bind to a specific IP address and port combination. Common application failures, sometimes called ''port conflicts'', occur when multiple programs attempt to use the same port number on the same IP address with the same protocol.\n\nApplications implementing common services often use specifically reserved [[well-known port numbers]] for receiving service requests from clients. This process is known as ''listening'', and involves the receipt of a request on the well-known port and establishing a one-to-one server-client dialog, using the same local port number. Other clients may continue to connect to the listening port; this works because a TCP connection is identified by a tuple consisting of the local address, the local port, the remote address, and the remote port.<ref>{{cite web|last=Postel|first=John|title=RFC 793|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>  The well-known ports are defined by convention overseen by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA).

The [[diffusion]] of the proteins is thus significantly reduced. After repeated washing with water, the gel is incubated in a [[silver nitrate]] solution. Silver ions bind to negatively charged side chains of the proteins. Excess silver ions are then washed off with water. In the final development step, the silver ions are reduced to elemental silver by addition of alkaline [[formaldehyde]]. This stains the sites where proteins are present, brown to black.\n\nThe intensity of the staining depends on the [[primary structure]] of the protein. Furthermore, the cleanliness of the vessels used and the purity of the [[reagents]] influence the silver stain.<ref>E. Hempelmann, M. Schulze, O.
