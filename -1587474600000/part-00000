It also stores in each internal node the result of applying some [[monoid|associative operation]] to its descendants.  This \"summary\" data stored in the internal nodes can be used to provide the functionality of data structures other than trees.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Finger-tree-queue.gif|thumb|421x421px|Finger tree used as a simple queue with amortized O(1) put & get operations.

Note that for each step we take down the spine, single values & digit children get nested with a new level of nodes.]]\n\nRalph Hinze and Ross Paterson state a finger tree is a functional representation of persistent sequences that can access the ends in amortized constant time. Concatenation and splitting can be done in logarithmic time in the size of the smaller piece. The structure can also be made into a general purpose data structure by defining the split operation in a general form, then it can work as a sequence, priority queue, search tree, priority search queue and more.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{citation|title=Finger Trees: A Simple General-purpose Data Structure|url=http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.pdf|year=2006|last1=Hinze|last2=Paterson|first1=Ralf|first2=Ross|journal=[[Journal of Functional Programming]]|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197\u2013217|doi=10.1017/S0956796805005769}}.</ref>\n\nA ''finger'' is a point where you can access ''part'' of a data structure; in imperative languages, this is called a pointer.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/finger-trees/|title=Finger Trees -  Andrew Gibiansky|last=Gibiansky|first=Andrew|website=andrew.gibiansky.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> In a finger tree, the fingers are structures that point to the ends of a sequence, or the leaf nodes. The fingers are added on to the original tree to allow for that constant time access to fingers. In the images shown below, the fingers are the lines reaching out of the spine to the nodes.\n\nA finger tree is composed of different ''layers'' which can be identified by the nodes along its ''spine''. The spine of a tree can be thought of the trunk in the same way trees have leaves and a root. Though finger trees are often shown with the spine and branches coming off the sides, there are actually two nodes on the spine at each level that have been paired to make this central spine. The ''prefix'' is on the left of the spine, while the ''suffix'' is on the right. Each of those nodes has a link to the next level of the spine until they reach the root.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Finger-tree from 2-3 tree.jpg|alt=2-3 tree and it transformed into a finger tree|thumb|487x487px|Shows a 2-3 tree (top) can be pulled up into a finger tree (bottom)]]\nThe first level of the tree contains only values, the leaf nodes of the tree, and is of depth 0. The second level is of depth 1. The third is of depth 2 and so on. The closer to the root, the deeper the subtrees of the original tree (the tree before it was a finger tree) the nodes points to. In this way, working down the tree is going from the leaves to the root of the tree, which is the opposite of the typical tree data structure. To get this nice and unusual structure, we have to make sure the original tree has a uniform depth. To ensure that the depth is uniform, when declaring the node object, it must be parameterized by the type of the child. The nodes on the spine of depth 1 and above point to trees, and with this parameterization they can be represented by the nested nodes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/26/finger-trees-done-right-i-hope/|title=Finger Trees Done Right (I hope)|work=Good Math, Bad Math|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Transforming a tree into a finger tree ===\nWe will start this process with a balanced [[2-3 tree]]. For the finger tree to work, all the leaf nodes need to also be level.\n\nA finger is \u201ca structure providing efficient access to nodes of a tree near a distinguished location.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> To make a finger tree we need to put fingers to the right and left ends of the tree and transform it like a [[Zipper (data structure)|zipper]]. This gives us that constant amortized time access to the ends of a sequence.\n\nTo transform, start with the balanced 2-3 tree.\n\nTake the leftmost and rightmost internal nodes of the tree and pull them up so the rest of the tree dangles between them as shown in the image to the right. \n\nCombines the spines to make a standard 2-3 finger tree.\n\nThis can be described as<ref name=\":0\" />: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ndata FingerTree a = Empty \n                    | Single a \n                    | Deep (Digit a) (FingerTree (Node a)) (Digit a)\ndata Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a\n</syntaxhighlight>The digits in the examples shown are the nodes with letters. Each list is divided by the prefix or suffix of each node on the spine. In a transformed 2-3 tree it seems that the digit lists at the top level can have a length of two or three with the lower levels only having length of one or two. In order for some application of finger trees to run so efficiently, finger trees allow between one and four subtrees on each level.\n\nThe digits of the finger tree can be transformed into a list like so<ref name=\":0\" />:  <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntype Digit a = One a | Two a a | Three a a a | Four a a a a\n</syntaxhighlight>And so on the image, the top level has elements of type ''a'', the next has elements of type ''Node a'' because the node in between the spine and leaves, and this would go on meaning in general that the ''n''th level of the tree has elements of type <math>Node^n </math> ''a'', or 2-3 trees of depth n. This means a sequence of ''n'' elements is represented by a tree of depth \u0398(log ''n''). Even better, an element ''d'' places from the nearest end is stored at a depth of \u0398(log d) in the tree.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Reductions ====\n\n<math>\\begin{matrix} \\mathrm{instance} \\ Reduce \\ Node \\ \\mathrm{where}  \n\\\\\\\\ reducer\\ (\\prec)\\ (Node2 \\ a \\ b)\\ z = a\\ \\prec(b\\ \\prec\\ z)\n\\\\ reducer\\ (\\prec)\\ (Node3 \\ a \\ b \\ c)\\ z = a\\ \\prec(\\ b\\prec(c\\ \\prec\\ z ))\n\\\\ reducel\\ (\\succ)\\ z\\ (Node2 \\ b \\ a)\\ =(z\\ \\succ\\ b)\\ \\succ\\ a\n\\\\ reducel\\ (\\succ)\\ z\\ (Node3 \\ c \\ b \\ a)\\ = ((z\\ \\succ\\ c) \\succ\\ b) \\succ\\ a\n\n\\\\\\\\ \\mathrm{instance} \\ Reduce \\ FingerTree \\ \\mathrm{where}  \n\\\\\\\\ reducer\\ (\\prec)\\ (Empty)\\ z\\ = z\n\\\\ reducer\\ (\\prec)\\ (Single \\ x)\\ z = x\\ \\prec\\ z\n\\\\ reducer\\ (\\prec)\\ (Deep \\ pr \\ m \\ sf)\\ z = pr\\ \\prec'\\ (m\\ \\prec''\\ (sf\\ \\prec'\\ z))\n\\\\ where\n\\\\ (\\prec')\\ = reducer\\ (\\prec)\n\\\\ (\\prec'')\\ = reducer\\ (reducer\\ (\\prec))\n\\\\\\\\ reducel\\ (\\succ)\\ z\\ (Empty)\\ = z\n\\\\ reducel\\ (\\succ)\\ z\\ (Single\\ \\ x)\\ = z\\ \\succ\\ x\n\\\\ reducel\\ (\\succ)\\ z\\ (Deep\\ \\ pr \\ m \\ sf)\\ = ((z\\ \\succ'\\ pr)\\ \\succ''\\ m)\\ \\succ'\\ sf)\n\\\\ where\n\\\\ (\\succ')\\ = reducer\\ (\\succ)\n\\\\ (\\succ'')\\ = reducer\\ (reducer\\ (\\succ))\\end{matrix}</math>\n\n=== Deque operations ===\nFinger trees also make efficient [[Double-ended queue|deques]]. Whether the structure is persistent or not, all operations take \u0398(1) amortized time. The analysis can be compared to Okasaki's implicit deques, the only difference being that the FingerTree type stores Nodes instead of pairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Application ==\nFinger trees can be used to build other trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abhiroop.github.io/Finger-Trees/|title=Finger Tree - The ultimate data structure?|last=Sarkar|first=Abhiroop|website=abhiroop.github.io|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> For example, a [[priority queue]] can be implemented by labeling the internal nodes by the minimum priority of its children in the tree, or an indexed list/array can be implemented with a labeling of nodes by the count of the leaves in their children. Other applications are random-access sequences, described below, [[ordered sequence]]s, and [[interval tree]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinger trees can provide amortized O(1) pushing, reversing, popping, O(log n) append and split; and can be adapted to be indexed or ordered sequences. And like all functional data structures, it is inherently [[persistent data structure|persistent]]; that is, older versions of the tree are always preserved.\n\n=== Random-access sequences ===\nFinger trees can efficiently implement random-access sequences. This should support fast positional operations including accessing the ''n''th element and splitting a sequence at a certain position. To do this, we annotate the finger tree with sizes.<ref name=\":0\" /><syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Size = Size{ getSize :: N }\n  deriving (Eq, Ord)\n\ninstance Monoid Size where\n  \u2205 = Size 0\n  Size m \u2295 Size n = Size (m + n)\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''N'' is for natural numbers. The new type is needed because the type is the carrier of different monoids. Another new type is still needed for the elements in the sequence, shown below. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Elem a = Elem{ getElem :: a }\nnewtype Seq a = Seq (FingerTree Size (Elem a))\n\ninstance Measured (Elem a) Size where\n  ||Elem|| = Size 1\n</syntaxhighlight>These lines of code show that instance works a base case for measuring the sizes and the elements are of size one. The use of '''newtype'''s doesn't cause a run-time penalty in Haskell because in a library, the ''Size'' and ''Elem'' types would be hidden from the user with wrapper functions.\n\nWith these changes, the length of a sequence can now be computed in constant time.\n\n== First publication ==\nFinger trees were first published in 1977 by [[Leonidas J.

It also stores in each internal node the result of applying some [[monoid|associative operation]] to its descendants.  This \"summary\" data stored in the internal nodes can be used to provide the functionality of data structures other than trees.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Finger-tree-queue.gif|thumb|421x421px|Finger tree used as a simple queue with amortized O(1) put & get operations.

The fingers are added on to the original tree to allow for that constant time access to fingers. In the images shown below, the fingers are the lines reaching out of the spine to the nodes.\n\nA finger tree is composed of different ''layers'' which can be identified by the nodes along its ''spine''. The spine of a tree can be thought of the trunk in the same way trees have leaves and a root. Though finger trees are often shown with the spine and branches coming off the sides, there are actually two nodes on the spine at each level that have been paired to make this central spine. The ''prefix'' is on the left of the spine, while the ''suffix'' is on the right. Each of those nodes has a link to the next level of the spine until they reach the root.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Finger-tree from 2-3 tree.jpg|alt=2-3 tree and it transformed into a finger tree|thumb|487x487px|Shows a 2-3 tree (top) can be pulled up into a finger tree (bottom)]]\nThe first level of the tree contains only values, the leaf nodes of the tree, and is of depth 0. The second level is of depth 1. The third is of depth 2 and so on. The closer to the root, the deeper the subtrees of the original tree (the tree before it was a finger tree) the nodes points to. In this way, working down the tree is going from the leaves to the root of the tree, which is the opposite of the typical tree data structure. To get this nice and unusual structure, we have to make sure the original tree has a uniform depth. To ensure that the depth is uniform, when declaring the node object, it must be parameterized by the type of the child. The nodes on the spine of depth 1 and above point to trees, and with this parameterization they can be represented by the nested nodes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/26/finger-trees-done-right-i-hope/|title=Finger Trees Done Right (I hope)|work=Good Math, Bad Math|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Transforming a tree into a finger tree ===\nWe will start this process with a balanced [[2-3 tree]]. For the finger tree to work, all the leaf nodes need to also be level.\n\nA finger is \u201ca structure providing efficient access to nodes of a tree near a distinguished location.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> To make a finger tree we need to put fingers to the right and left ends of the tree and transform it like a [[Zipper (data structure)|zipper]]. This gives us that constant amortized time access to the ends of a sequence.\n\nTo transform, start with the balanced 2-3 tree.\n\nTake the leftmost and rightmost internal nodes of the tree and pull them up so the rest of the tree dangles between them as shown in the image to the right. \n\nCombines the spines to make a standard 2-3 finger tree.\n\nThis can be described as<ref name=\":0\" />: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ndata FingerTree a = Empty \n                    | Single a \n                    | Deep (Digit a) (FingerTree (Node a)) (Digit a)\ndata Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a\n</syntaxhighlight>The digits in the examples shown are the nodes with letters. Each list is divided by the prefix or suffix of each node on the spine. In a transformed 2-3 tree it seems that the digit lists at the top level can have a length of two or three with the lower levels only having length of one or two. In order for some application of finger trees to run so efficiently, finger trees allow between one and four subtrees on each level.\n\nThe digits of the finger tree can be transformed into a list like so<ref name=\":0\" />:  <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntype Digit a = One a | Two a a | Three a a a | Four a a a a\n</syntaxhighlight>And so on the image, the top level has elements of type ''a'', the next has elements of type ''Node a'' because the node in between the spine and leaves, and this would go on meaning in general that the ''n''th level of the tree has elements of type <math>Node^n </math> ''a'', or 2-3 trees of depth n. This means a sequence of ''n'' elements is represented by a tree of depth \u0398(log ''n''). Even better, an element ''d'' places from the nearest end is stored at a depth of \u0398(log d) in the tree.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Reductions ====\nReduction of nodes:\n\n<math>\\begin{matrix} \\mathrm{instance} \\ Reduce \\ Node \\ \\mathrm{where}  \n\\\\ reducer (\\prec) (Node2 \\ a \\ b) z = a \\prec(b \\prec z )\n\\\\ reducer (\\prec) (Node3 \\ a \\ b \\ c) z = a \\prec(b \\prec(c \\prec z ))\n\\\\ reducel (\\succ) z (Node2 \\ b \\ a) =(z \\succ b) \\succ a\n\\\\ reducel (\\succ) z (Node3 \\ c \\ b \\ a) = ((z \\succ c) \\succ b) \\succ a \\end{matrix}</math>\n\nReduction of finger trees:\n\n'''instance''' ''Reduce FingerTree'' '''where'''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) ''Empty''                 ''z = z''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) (''Single x'')            ''z = x <math>\\prec</math> z''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) (''Deep pr m sf'' )   ''z = pr'' <math>\\prec</math>' (''m'' <math>\\prec</math><nowiki>''</nowiki> (''sf <math>\\prec</math>''<nowiki/>' ))\n\n'''where''' (<math>\\prec</math>') = ''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>)\n\n(<math>\\prec</math><nowiki>''</nowiki>) = ''reducer'' (''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>))\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z Empty''                    = z\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z'' (''Single x'')               = z <math>\\succ</math> x\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z'' (''Deep pr m sf'' )      = ((''z'' <math>\\succ</math>' ''pr'') <math>\\succ</math><nowiki>''</nowiki> ''m'') <math>\\succ</math>''<nowiki/>'sf''\n\n'''where''' (<math>\\succ</math>' ) = ''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>)\n\n(<math>\\succ</math><nowiki>''</nowiki>) = ''reducel'' (''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>))<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Deque operations ===\nFinger trees also make efficient [[Double-ended queue|deques]]. Whether the structure is persistent or not, all operations take \u0398(1) amortized time. The analysis can be compared to Okasaki's implicit deques, the only difference being that the FingerTree type stores Nodes instead of pairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Application ==\nFinger trees can be used to build other trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abhiroop.github.io/Finger-Trees/|title=Finger Tree - The ultimate data structure?|last=Sarkar|first=Abhiroop|website=abhiroop.github.io|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> For example, a [[priority queue]] can be implemented by labeling the internal nodes by the minimum priority of its children in the tree, or an indexed list/array can be implemented with a labeling of nodes by the count of the leaves in their children. Other applications are random-access sequences, described below, [[ordered sequence]]s, and [[interval tree]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinger trees can provide amortized O(1) pushing, reversing, popping, O(log n) append and split; and can be adapted to be indexed or ordered sequences. And like all functional data structures, it is inherently [[persistent data structure|persistent]]; that is, older versions of the tree are always preserved.\n\n=== Random-access sequences ===\nFinger trees can efficiently implement random-access sequences. This should support fast positional operations including accessing the ''n''th element and splitting a sequence at a certain position. To do this, we annotate the finger tree with sizes.<ref name=\":0\" /><syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Size = Size{ getSize :: N }\n  deriving (Eq, Ord)\n\ninstance Monoid Size where\n  \u2205 = Size 0\n  Size m \u2295 Size n = Size (m + n)\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''N'' is for natural numbers. The new type is needed because the type is the carrier of different monoids. Another new type is still needed for the elements in the sequence, shown below. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Elem a = Elem{ getElem :: a }\nnewtype Seq a = Seq (FingerTree Size (Elem a))\n\ninstance Measured (Elem a) Size where\n  ||Elem|| = Size 1\n</syntaxhighlight>These lines of code show that instance works a base case for measuring the sizes and the elements are of size one. The use of '''newtype'''s doesn't cause a run-time penalty in Haskell because in a library, the ''Size'' and ''Elem'' types would be hidden from the user with wrapper functions.\n\nWith these changes, the length of a sequence can now be computed in constant time.\n\n== First publication ==\nFinger trees were first published in 1977 by [[Leonidas J.

At [[Metacritic]], the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 71, based on seven reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> [[Album of the Year (website)|Album of the Year]] assessed the critical consensus as a 71 out of 100.<ref name=\"AOTY\"/>\n\nEvan Rytlewski of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' stated that ''Die Lit'' is \"an album that works almost completely from its own lunatic script. It is a perversely infectious sugar high, rap that fundamentally recalibrates the brain's reward centers\", praising the production and simplicity: \"At its best\u2014which is to say almost the entire thing, really\u2014the album almost seems to suspend gravity. How does a rapper this basic pull off a project this electrifying? No, Carti's rapping isn't any better this time out. And no, it really doesn't matter. When the carnival itself is this magnificent, there's no need to nitpick the ring-leader.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Corrigan B of ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'' said, \"Like its predecessor, it's an album of party records; these are songs that will be played ad infinitum at functions until the hooks, the breaks, and, of course, the bass are burned into the brain of every attendee.\"<ref name=\"TMT\"/> Maxwell Cavaseno of ''HotNewHipHop'' concluded that ''Die Lit'' \"feels like the closest to a fully realized album as Carti is ever going to come close to achieving\" and that it \"should, at the very least, be respected for doing so much while doing so very little.\"<ref name=\"HNHH\"/> Online publication [[Sputnikmusic]] stated: \"A lot of the gratification of this record is in the production, which takes the age-old hip-hop trick of taking a fractional melodic idea, barely a song by itself, and spinning out of it a thick sonic weave.\"<ref name=\"Sputnikmusic\"/>\n\nA. Harmony from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' criticized the album for having a lack of variety, saying \"It's fun enough but, save for a few keepers, has the lifespan of a mayfly. Rock to it for the summer and forget most of it by September.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> Riley Wallace of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' stated, \"Through a more respectable body of work\u2014is unlikely to win over any naysayers.\"<ref name=\"HipHopDX\"/> Neil Z. Yeung of [[AllMusic]] said, \"Like [[Rae Sremmurd]] and [[Migos]], these big-bass trap anthems owe much to their club-friendly vibe, but offer little in terms of substance or lasting impact.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At [[Metacritic]], the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 71, based on seven reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> [[Album of the Year (website)|Album of the Year]] assessed the critical consensus as a 71 out of 100.<ref name=\"AOTY\"/>\n\nEvan Rytlewski of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' stated that ''Die Lit'' is \"an album that works almost completely from its own lunatic script. It is a perversely infectious sugar high, rap that fundamentally recalibrates the brain's reward centers\", praising the production and simplicity: \"At its best\u2014which is to say almost the entire thing, really\u2014the album almost seems to suspend gravity. How does a rapper this basic pull off a project this electrifying? No, Carti's rapping isn't any better this time out. And no, it really doesn't matter. When the carnival itself is this magnificent, there's no need to nitpick the ring-leader.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Corrigan B of ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'' said, \"Like its predecessor, it's an album of party records; these are songs that will be played ad infinitum at functions until the hooks, the breaks, and, of course, the bass are burned into the brain of every attendee.\"<ref name=\"TMT\"/> Maxwell Cavaseno of ''HotNewHipHop'' concluded that ''Die Lit'' \"feels like the closest to a fully realized album as Carti is ever going to come close to achieving\" and that it \"should, at the very least, be respected for doing so much while doing so very little.\"<ref name=\"HNHH\"/> Online publication [[Sputnikmusic]] stated: \"A lot of the gratification of this record is in the production, which takes the age-old hip-hop trick of taking a fractional melodic idea, barely a song by itself, and spinning out of it a thick sonic weave.\"<ref name=\"Sputnikmusic\"/>\n\nA. Harmony from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' criticized the album for having a lack of variety, saying \"It's fun enough but, save for a few keepers, has the lifespan of a mayfly. Rock to it for the summer and forget most of it by September.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/> Riley Wallace of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' stated, \"Through a more respectable body of work\u2014is unlikely to win over any naysayers.\"<ref name=\"HipHopDX\"/> Neil Z. Yeung of [[AllMusic]] said, \"Like [[Rae Sremmurd]] and [[Migos]], these big-bass trap anthems owe much to their club-friendly vibe, but offer little in terms of substance or lasting impact.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 78, based on 13 reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/> Ben Beaumount-Thomas of ''[[The Guardian]]'' complimented the album's production, lyricism and Skepta's delivery: \"Throughout it all is Skepta's flow, honed by years spent in clashes, raves and booths into a formidable instrument. At times you can detect just a trace of [[Giggs (rapper)|Giggs]]' style of emphatic punchlines, but the chief pleasure of this album is how much it allows Skepta to be Skepta: an MC who always looks, waits, then darts between the traffic of his beats. This sensual pleasure goes beyond lyrics and into pure music, and should sustain his career long past his recent triumphant homecoming.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> \n\nIan McQuaid of ''[[The Independent]]'' described ''Ignorance Is Bliss'' as \"a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative\", adding that Skepta \"might just have invented a new genre.\"<ref name=\"Independent\" /> For ''[[NME]]'', Jordan Bassett wrote that the album is \"a diverse-sounding, assured success, a muscular record that conveys global ambition, drawing on a dizzying collection of sounds and influences\", noting the \"colourful, kaleidoscopic and loose\" approach in contrast to Skepta's previous studio album, ''[[Konnichiwa (Skepta album)|Konnichiwa]]''.<ref name=\"MC\" />\n\nIn a mixed review, Will Pritchard of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' concluded that \"as Skepta tussles to find his place in the world, you\u2019re left wondering whether he craves the bliss of youthful innocence or the responsibility of being a voice for a generation. Unfortunately, ''Ignorance Is Bliss'' is a deferral, splitting the difference with a series of half-measures.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 78, based on 13 reviews, indicating \"generally favourable reviews.\"<ref name=\"MC\"/> Ben Beaumount-Thomas of ''[[The Guardian]]'' complimented the album's production, lyricism and Skepta's delivery: \"Throughout it all is Skepta's flow, honed by years spent in clashes, raves and booths into a formidable instrument. At times you can detect just a trace of [[Giggs (rapper)|Giggs]]' style of emphatic punchlines, but the chief pleasure of this album is how much it allows Skepta to be Skepta: an MC who always looks, waits, then darts between the traffic of his beats. This sensual pleasure goes beyond lyrics and into pure music, and should sustain his career long past his recent triumphant homecoming.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> \n\nIan McQuaid of ''[[The Independent]]'' described ''Ignorance Is Bliss'' as \"a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative\", adding that Skepta \"might just have invented a new genre.\"<ref name=\"Independent\" /> For ''[[NME]]'', Jordan Bassett wrote that the album is \"a diverse-sounding, assured success, a muscular record that conveys global ambition, drawing on a dizzying collection of sounds and influences\", noting the \"colourful, kaleidoscopic and loose\" approach in contrast to Skepta's previous studio album, ''[[Konnichiwa (Skepta album)|Konnichiwa]]''.<ref name=\"MC\" />\n\nIn a mixed review, Will Pritchard of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' concluded that \"as Skepta tussles to find his place in the world, you\u2019re left wondering whether he craves the bliss of youthful innocence or the responsibility of being a voice for a generation. Unfortunately, ''Ignorance Is Bliss'' is a deferral, splitting the difference with a series of half-measures.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
