He was one of the dominant figures of the post-war classical music world.\n\nBorn in [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]] in the Loire department of France, the son of an engineer, Boulez studied at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] with [[Olivier Messiaen]], and privately with [[Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]]. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as music director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in [[avant-garde music]], playing an important role in the development of [[integral serialism]] and [[Aleatoric music|controlled chance music]]. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as ''[[Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre]]'', ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' and ''[[R\u00e9pons]]''. His uncompromising commitment to modernism and the trenchant, [[polemic]]al tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist.\n\nIn parallel with his activities as a composer Boulez became one of the most prominent conductors of his generation. In a career lasting more than sixty years he held the positions of chief conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], music director of the [[Ensemble Intercontemporain]] and principal guest conductor of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. He made frequent guest appearances with many of the world's other great orchestras, including the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra|Vienna Philharmonic]], the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra|Berlin Philharmonic]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. He was particularly known for his performances of the music of the first half of the twentieth century\u2014including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]], and the [[Second Viennese School]]\u2014as well as that of his contemporaries, such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti|Ligeti]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Elliott Carter|Carter]]. His work in the opera house included the ''[[Jahrhundertring]]''\u2014the production of [[Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''Ring'' cycle]] for the centenary of the [[Bayreuth Festival]]\u2014and the world premiere of the three-act version of [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''. His recorded legacy is extensive.\n\nHe founded a number of musical institutions in Paris, including the [[Domaine Musical]], the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique ([[IRCAM]]), the Ensemble Intercontemporain and the [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique]], as well as the [[Lucerne Festival Academy]] in Switzerland.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===1925\u20131943: Childhood and school days===\nPierre Boulez was born on 26 March 1925, in [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]], a small town\nin the [[Loire (department)|Loire department]] of east-central France, to L\u00e9on and Marcelle (''n\u00e9e'' Calabre) Boulez.<ref name=Nichols6Jan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/pierre-boulez|title=Pierre Boulez obituary|work=The Guardian|first=Roger|last=Nichols|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=6 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106151953/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/pierre-boulez|archivedate=6 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was the third of four children: an older sister, Jeanne (1922\u20132018)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.francemusique.fr/actualite-musicale/mort-de-jeanne-boulez-chevalier-soeur-de-pierre-boulez-64349 |title=Mort de Jeanne Boulez-Chevalier, soeur de Pierre Boulez |last1=Decalf |first1=Guillaume |date=9 August 2018 |website=France Musique |access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref> and younger brother, Roger (b. 1936) were preceded by a first child, also called Pierre (b. 1920), who died in infancy.

The family prospered, moving in 1929 from the apartment above a pharmacy, where Boulez was born, to a comfortable detached house, where he spent most of his childhood.<ref>Peyser (1976), 21\u201322; Heyworth (1986), 3; [[Dominique Jameux|Jameux 3]].</ref>\n\nFrom the age of seven Boulez went to school at the Institut Victor de Laprade, a Catholic seminary where the thirteen-hour school day was filled with study and prayer.

Impressed by his ability, she persuaded L\u00e9on to allow his son to apply to the [[Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur de musique et de danse de Lyon|Conservatoire in Lyon]]. The selection board rejected him but Boulez was determined to pursue a career in music. The following year, with his sister's support in the face of opposition from his father, he studied the piano and harmony privately with Lionel de Pachmann (son of the pianist [[Vladimir de Pachmann|Vladimir]]).<ref>Peyser (1976), 24\u201325; Jameux, 6\u20137; Heyworth (1986), 4.</ref> \"Our parents were strong, but finally we were stronger than they\", Boulez later said.<ref>Peyser (1976), 24.</ref> In fact, when he moved to Paris in the autumn of 1943, hoping to enrol at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], L\u00e9on accompanied him, helped him to find a room (in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th arrondissement]]) and subsidised him until he could earn a living.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 4; Hill and Simeone, 139; O'Hagan, 9.</ref>\n\n===1943\u20131946: Musical education===\nIn October 1943, he auditioned unsuccessfully for the advanced piano class at the Conservatoire, but he was admitted in January 1944 to the preparatory harmony class of [[Georges Dandelot]].

He greatly enjoyed working with her and she remembered him as an exceptional student, using his exercises as models in advanced counterpoint until the end of her teaching career.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 5; Archimbaud, 24.</ref> In the autumn he joined [[Olivier Messiaen|Olivier Messiaen's]] advanced harmony class at the Conservatoire and attended the private seminars which Messiaen gave to chosen students, where key works of the early twentieth century, including Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', were subjected to intensive analysis.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 9.</ref>\n\nIn January 1945 Boulez moved to two small attic rooms in the [[Le Marais|Marais]] district of Paris, where he lived for the next fourteen years.<ref>Barbedette, 212; Peyser, 30.</ref> The following month he attended a private performance of Schoenberg's [[Wind Quintet (Schoenberg)|Wind Quintet]], conducted by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], the composer and follower of Schoenberg. Its strict use of [[twelve-tone technique]] was a revelation to him and he organised a group of fellow students to take private lessons with Leibowitz.

New works included the [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)|first two piano sonatas]] and initial versions of two cantatas on poems by [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], ''[[Le Visage nuptial]]''{{refn|The Nuptial Countenance.|group=n|name=visage}} and ''[[Le Soleil des eaux]]''.<ref>Samuel (2002), 421\u201322.</ref>{{refn|The Sun of the Waters,|group=n|name=soleil}} In October 1951 a substantial work for eighteen solo instruments, ''[[Polyphonie X]]'', caused a scandal at its premiere at the [[Donaueschingen Festival]], some audience members disrupting the performance with hisses and whistles.<ref>Peyser (1976), 66.</ref>\n\nAround this time he met two composers who were to be important influences: [[John Cage]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers ([[Heugel (music publisher)|Heugel]] and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage's ''[[Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano]]''.<ref>Peyser (1976), 60\u201361; Boulez and Cage, 41\u201348.</ref> When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence about the future of music.

As well as Stockhausen, Boulez was in contact there with other composers who would become significant figures in contemporary music, including [[Luciano Berio]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Bruno Maderna]], and [[Henri Pousseur]]. Boulez quickly became one of the leaders of the post-war modernist movement in the arts. As [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] observed: \"at all times he seemed absolutely sure of what he was doing. Amid the confusion of postwar life, with so many truths discredited, his certitude was reassuring.\"<ref>Ross, 360.</ref>\n\n===1954\u20131959: Le Domaine musical===\n[[File:Theatre Marigny - Salle Popesco.jpg|thumb|The Salle Popesco in Paris, formerly the Petit Marigny]]\nIn 1954, with the financial backing of Barrault and Renaud, he started a series of concerts at the Petit Marigny theatre. They became known as the [[Domaine musical]]. The concerts focused initially on three areas: pre-war classics still unfamiliar in Paris (such as Bart\u00f3k and Webern), works by the new generation (Stockhausen, Nono) and neglected masters from the past ([[Machaut]], [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]])\u2014although for practical reasons the last category fell away in subsequent seasons.<ref>Jameux 61\u201362, 71\u201372.</ref> Boulez proved an energetic and accomplished administrator and the concerts were an immediate success.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 21; Jameux, 62\u201364; Campbell and O'Hagan, 9; Aguila, 55.</ref> They attracted musicians, painters and writers, as well as fashionable society, but they were so costly that Boulez had to turn to wealthy private patrons for support.<ref>Jameux, 65\u201367; Peyser (1976), 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nKey events in the Domaine's history included a Webern festival (1955), the European premiere of Stravinsky's ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]'' (1957) and first performances of Messiaen's ''[[Oiseaux exotiques]]'' (1955) and ''Sept Ha\u00efka\u00ef'' (1963). The concerts moved to the Salle Gaveau (1956\u20131959) and then to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on (1959\u20131968). Boulez remained director until 1967, when Gilbert Amy succeeded him.<ref>Steinegger, 64\u201366; Hill and Simeone, 211 and 253.</ref>\n\nOn 18 June 1955 [[Hans Rosbaud]] conducted the first performance of Boulez's best-known work, ''[[Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre]]''{{refn|The Hammer without a Master.|group=n|name=marteau}}, at the ISCM Festival in Baden-Baden. A nine-movement cycle for alto voice and instrumental ensemble based on poems by Ren\u00e9 Char,<ref name=Nichols6Jan/> it was an immediate, international success.<ref>Jameux, 79\u201380.</ref> [[William Glock]] wrote: \"even at a first hearing, though difficult to take in, it was so utterly new in sound, texture and feeling that it seemed to possess a mythical quality like that of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot lunaire''.\"<ref>Glock, 132.</ref> When Boulez conducted the work in Los Angeles in early 1957, Stravinsky\u2014who described it as \"one of the few significant works of the post-war period of exploration\"\u2014attended the performance. Boulez dined several times with the Stravinskys and (according to [[Robert Craft]]) \"soon captivated the older composer with new musical ideas, and an extraordinary intelligence, quickness and humour\".<ref>Walsh, 359; Heyworth (1986), 15 and 22.</ref> Relations soured somewhat the following year over the first Paris performance of Stravinsky's ''[[Threni (Stravinsky)|Threni]]'' for the Domaine musical.

A serial work of great energy, its single-movement form was influenced by Schoenberg's [[Chamber Symphony No. 1 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 1]].<ref>Jameux, 228.</ref> Bennett finds in the piece a tone new to Boulez's writing: \"a sharp, brittle violence juxtaposed against an extreme sensitivity and delicacy\".<ref>Bennett, 57.</ref> In the [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)|Piano Sonata No. 1]] (1946\u201349) the biographer [[Dominique Jameux]] highlights the sheer number of different kinds of attack in its two short movements\u2014and the frequent accelerations of tempo in the second movement\u2014which together suggest the feeling of \"instrumental delirium\".<ref>Jameux, 239.</ref>\n\nThere followed two cantatas based on the poetry of [[Ren\u00e9 Char]]. Of ''Le Visage nuptial''{{refn|group=n|name=visage}} [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] observes that \"Char's five poems speak in hard-edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion\", which Boulez reflected in music \"on the borders of fevered hysteria\". In its original version (1946\u201347) the piece was scored for small forces (soprano, contralto, two ondes Martenot, piano and percussion). Forty years later Boulez arrived at the definitive version for soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra (1985\u20131989).<ref name=Visage /> ''Le Soleil des eaux''{{refn|group=n|name=soleil}} (1948) originated in incidental music for a radio drama by Char.

Of the two middle movements Boulez said: \"I tried to disintegrate slow movement form by the use of the trope, and repetitive scherzo form by the use of variation form.\"<ref>Boulez (1975), 41\u201342.</ref> For Griffiths the violent character of much of the music \"is not just superficial: it is expressive of a whole aesthetic of annihilation, and in particular of a need to obliterate what had gone before\".<ref name=\"Griffiths 1978, 16\">Griffiths (1978), 16.</ref> Boulez played the work for [[Aaron Copland]], who asked: \"But must we start a revolution all over again?\"\u2014\"Yes, mercilessly\", Boulez replied.<ref>Ross, 378.</ref>\n\n===Total serialism===\nThat revolution entered its most extreme phase in 1950\u20131952, when Boulez developed a technique in which not only pitch but other musical parameters\u2014duration, dynamics, timbre and attack\u2014were organised according to serial principles, an approach known as total [[serialism]] or [[punctualism]]. Messiaen had already made an experiment in this direction in his ''Mode de valeurs et d'intensit\u00e9s''{{refn|Mode of Duration and Dynamics.|group=n}} for piano (1949). Boulez's first sketches towards total serialism appeared in parts of ''Livre pour quatuor'' (Book for Quartet, 1948\u201349, revised 2011\u201312), a collection of movements for string quartet from which the players may choose at any one performance, foreshadowing Boulez's later interest in variable form.<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\">Hopkins and Griffiths.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s Boulez began to apply the technique rigorously, ordering each parameter into sets of twelve and prescribing no repetition until all twelve had sounded. According to the music critic Alex Ross the resulting surfeit of ever-changing musical data has the effect of erasing at any given point previous impressions the listener may have formed: \"the present moment is all there is\".<ref>Ross, 363\u2013364.</ref> Boulez linked this development to a desire by his generation to create a ''tabula rasa'' after the war.<ref name=Toronyi-Lalic>{{cite news|last=Toronyi-Lalic|first=Igor|date=20 July 2012|title=theartsdesk Q&A: Composer Pierre Boulez|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/theartsdesk-qa-composer-pierre-boulez|newspaper=theartsdesk|access-date=14 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319022849/http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/theartsdesk-qa-composer-pierre-boulez|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHis works in this idiom are ''[[Polyphonie X]]'' (1950{{ndash}}51; withdrawn) for 18 instruments, the two ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' ''[[\u00e9tude]]s'' (1951\u201352; withdrawn), and ''[[Structures (Boulez)|Structures, Book I]]'' for two pianos (1951\u201352).<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/> Speaking of ''Structures, Book I'' in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which \"the responsibility of the composer is practically absent. Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made the piece that way. But I did it by hand...It was a demonstration through the absurd.\" Asked whether it should still be listened to as music, Boulez replied: \"I am not terribly eager to listen to it. But for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Toronyi-Lalic />\n\n===''Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre'' and ''Pli selon pli''===\n''Structures, Book I'' was a turning point for Boulez. Recognising a lack of expressive flexibility in the language (described in his essay \"At the Limit of Fertile Land...\"),<ref>Boulez (1991), 162.</ref> Boulez loosened the strictness of total serialism into a more supple and strongly gestural music: \"I am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos\", he wrote to Cage.<ref>Campbell, 13.</ref> The most significant result of this new freedom was ''Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre''{{refn|group=n|name=marteau}} (1953\u20131955), described by Griffiths and [[Bill Hopkins (composer)|Bill Hopkins]] as a \"keystone of twentieth-century music\".<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/> Three short poems by Char form the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (one is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring.<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/> The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, [[xylorimba]], vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, to which he had always been attracted.<ref>Boulez (1976), 67.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stephane Mallarme.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=head and shoulders photograph of middle-aged white man with neat beard full head of greying hair|St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]]\nFor the text of his next major work, ''[[Pli selon pli]]''{{refn|group=n|name=pli}} (1957\u20131989), Boulez turned to the symbolist poetry of Stephane Mallarm\u00e9, attracted by its extreme density and radical syntax.<ref>Boulez (1976), 93.</ref> At seventy minutes, it is his longest composition. Three ''Improvisations''\u2014of increasing complexity\u2014on individual sonnets are framed by two orchestral movements, into which fragments of other poems are embedded.<ref>Guldbrandsen.</ref> Boulez's word-setting, which in the first Improvisation is straightforwardly syllabic, becomes ever more [[melisma]]tic, to the point where the words cannot be distinguished. Boulez's stated aim was to make the sonnets ''become'' the music at a deeper, structural level.<ref>Bradshaw, 186.</ref> The piece is scored for soprano and large orchestra, often deployed in chamber groups. Boulez described its sound-world, rich in percussion, as \"not so much frozen as extraordinarily 'vitrified{{'\"}}.<ref>Boulez (1976), 94.</ref> The work had a complex genesis, reaching its definitive form in 1989.<ref>Samuel (2002), 424\u201325.</ref>\n\n===Controlled chance===\nFrom the 1950s Boulez experimented with what he called \"controlled chance\" and he developed his views on [[aleatoric music]] in the articles \"Al\u00e9a\"<ref>Boulez (1991), 26\u201338.</ref> and \"Sonate, que me veux-tu?\"{{refn|What do you want from me, sonata?|group=n}}, in which he wrote of \"the investigation of a relative world, a permanent 'discovering' rather like the state of 'permanent revolution{{'\"}}.<ref>Boulez (1986), 143.</ref>\n\nPeyser observes that Boulez's use of chance is very different from that in the works of John Cage. While in Cage's music the performers are often given the freedom to create completely unforeseen sounds, with the object of removing the composer's intention from the music, in Boulez's music they may only choose between possibilities that have been written out in detail by the composer.<ref>Peyser (1976), 126\u2013129</ref> This method, when applied to the successional order of sections, is often described as \"mobile form\", a technique innovated by the composer [[Earle Brown]] and inspired by the mobile sculptures of [[Alexander Calder]], to whom Brown and Cage introduced Boulez when he was visiting New York in 1952.<ref>Barbedette, 143; Borchardt-Hume, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nBoulez employed variants of the technique in a number of works over the next two decades: in the [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)#Third Piano Sonata|Third Piano Sonata]] (1955\u20131957, revised 1963) the pianist may choose different routes through the score and in one movement (''Trope'') has the option of omitting certain passages altogether;<ref>Gardner and O'Hagan, 179.</ref> in ''\u00c9clat''{{refn|group=n|name=eclat}} (1965), the conductor triggers the order in which each player joins the ensemble; in ''Domaines'' (1961\u20131968) it is the soloist who dictates the order in which the sections are played by his movement around the stage. In later works, such as ''Cummings ist der Dichter''{{refn|Cummings is the Poet.|group=n}} (1970, revised 1986)\u2014a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by [[E. E. Cummings]]\u2014the conductor is given choice as to the order of certain events but there is no freedom for the individual player. In its original version ''Pli selon pli'' also contained elements of choice for the instrumentalists, but much of this was eliminated in later revisions.\n\nBy contrast ''Figures\u2014Doubles\u2014Prismes'' (1957\u20131968) is a fixed work with no chance element. Piencikowski describes it as \"a great cycle of variations whose components interpenetrate each other instead of remaining isolated in the traditional manner\".<ref>Piencikowski.</ref> It is notable for the unusual layout of the orchestra, in which the various families of instruments (woodwind, brass etc.) are scattered across the stage rather than being grouped together.<ref>Boulez (2003), 101.</ref>\n\n===Middle-period works===\nJonathan Goldman identifies a major aesthetic shift in Boulez's work from the mid-1970s onwards, characterised variously by the presence of thematic writing, a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form.<ref>Goldman, xv\u2013xvi.</ref> Boulez himself said: \"the ''envelope'' is simpler. The contents are not&nbsp;... I think in my recent work it is true that the first approach is more direct, and the gesture is more obvious, let's say.\"<ref>Ford, 23.</ref> The works from this period are amongst his most frequently performed.\n\nFor Goldman, ''[[Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna]]'' (1974\u201375) marks the beginning of this development. Boulez wrote this twenty-five minute work as an epitaph for his friend and colleague, the Italian composer and conductor, who died in 1973 at the age of 53. The piece is divided into fifteen sections, the orchestra into eight groups. While the odd-numbered sections are conducted, in the even sections the conductor merely sets each group in motion and its progress is regulated by a percussionist beating time. In his dedication Boulez described the work as \"a ritual of disappearance and survival\";<ref name=SamuelBooklet /> Griffiths refers to the work's \"awesome grandeur\".<ref>Griffiths (1978), 58\u201359.</ref>\n\n''Notations I\u2013IV'' (1980) are the first four transformations of piano miniatures from 1945 into pieces for very large orchestra. In his review of the New York premiere, [[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Andrew Porter]] wrote that the single idea of each original piece  \"has, as it were, been passed through a many-faceted bright prism and broken into a thousand linked, lapped, sparkling fragments\", the finale \"a terse modern ''Rite''&nbsp;... which sets the pulses racing\".<ref>Porter, 88.</ref>\n\n''[[D\u00e9rive 1]]''{{refn|Explaining the title in a letter to Glock, Boulez referred to the fact that the music \"derived\" from material in ''R\u00e9pons'' but also that one meaning of \"d\u00e9rive\" is the drifting of a boat in the wind or current.<ref>Glock, 174.</ref>|group=n}} (1984), dedicated to [[William Glock]] on his retirement from the Bath Festival,<ref name=\"Glock, 139\"/> is a short quintet in which the piano takes the lead. The material is derived from six chords and, according to Ivan Hewett, the piece \"shuffles and decorates these chords, bursting outwards in spirals and eddies, before returning to its starting point\". At the end the music \"shivers into silence\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Hewett|first=Ivan|date=26 September 2013|title=Ivan Hewett's Classic 50 No 39: Pierre Boulez\u2014D\u00e9rive 1|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classical-music-guide/10314695/Ivan-Hewetts-Classic-50-No-39-Pierre-Boulez-Derive-1.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=1 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102082508/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classical-music-guide/10314695/Ivan-Hewetts-Classic-50-No-39-Pierre-Boulez-Derive-1.html|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Works with electronics===\nBoulez likened the experience of listening to pre-recorded electronic music in the concert hall to a crematorium ceremony. His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of live instrumental sounds but the technology did not become available until the late 1970s and the founding of IRCAM. Before then he had produced ''Deux Etudes'' (1951) for [[magnetic tape]] for [[Pierre Schaeffer]]'s Groupe Recherche de la Radiodiffusion Fran\u00e7aise,<ref>Peyser (1976), 67.</ref> as well as a large-scale piece for live orchestra with tape, ''Po\u00e9sie pour pouvoir'' (1958){{refn|group=n|name=poesie}}. He was dissatisfied with both pieces and withdrew them.<ref>Rocco, 67; \"An Interview with [[Dominique Jameux]]\", in Boulez (1981), 201\u201302; Jameux, 114\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe first piece completed at IRCAM was ''[[R\u00e9pons]]'' (1980\u20131984).{{refn|The title is a reference to plainchant, in which the solo singer alternates with a choir. It reflects the interplay between the soloists and the ensemble (or, as Samuel puts it: the individual and the community).<ref>Samuel (2013)</ref>|group=n}} In this forty-minute work an instrumental ensemble is placed in the middle of the hall, while six soloists encircle the audience: two pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone and glockenspiel/xylophone. It is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through the space. [[Peter Heyworth]] described the moment at which they enter, some ten minutes into the piece: \"it is as though a great window were thrown open, through which a new sound world enters, and with it a new world of the imagination. Even more impressive is the fact that there is no longer a schism between the worlds of natural and electronic sounds, but rather a continuous spectrum.\"<ref>Heyworth (1982).</ref>\n\n''[[Dialogue de l'ombre double]]'' (1982\u20131985){{refn|Dialogue of the Double Shadow.

Lasting around eighteen minutes, it is a dialogue between a solo clarinet (played live, though sometimes reverberated through an offstage piano) and its double (in passages pre-recorded by the same musician and projected around the hall). Boulez approved transcriptions of the piece for bassoon (in 1995) and for recorder (in 2011).\n\nIn the early 1970s he had worked on an extended chamber piece called ''\u2026explosante-fixe\u2026''{{refn|The title of the work is a quotation from [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]'s ''L'Amour fou'': \"convulsive beauty will be erotic-veiled, exploding-fixed, magic-circumstantial, or it will not be.\"<ref name=SamuelBooklet/>|group=n}} for eight solo instruments, electronically transformed by a machine called a halophone, but the technology was still primitive and he eventually withdrew it.<ref>Vermeil, 207, 209 and 210; Jameux, 176\u201377.</ref> He re-used some of its material in other works, including a later piece with the same name.<ref>Campbell and O'Hagan, 297.</ref> This definitive version, recorded commercially, was composed at IRCAM between 1991 and 1993 for [[MIDI|MIDI-flute]] and two accompanying flutes with ensemble and live electronics. By this time the technology was such that the computer could follow the score and respond to triggers from the players.<ref>Rocco, 68.</ref> According to Griffiths, \"the principal flute is caught as if in a hall of mirrors, its line imitated in what the other flutes play, and then in the contributions of the larger ensemble.\".<ref>Griffiths (1995b)</ref> Hopkins and Griffiths describe it as \"music characteristically caught between thrill and desperation\".<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/>\n\n''[[Anth\u00e8mes|Anth\u00e8mes II]]'' for violin and electronics (1997) grew out of a piece for solo violin ''Anth\u00e8mes I'' (1991), which Boulez wrote for the Yehudi Menuhin Violin Competition in Paris and which in turn derived from material in the original ''\u2026explosante-fixe\u2026''<ref name=SamuelBooklet/> The virtuoso writing for the instrument is captured by the electronic system, transformed in real time and propelled around the space to create what Jonathan Goldman calls a \"hyper-violin\". Although this gives rise to effects of speed and complexity which no violinist could achieve, Boulez restricts the palette of electronic sounds so that their source, the violin, is always recognisable.<ref>Goldman, 169\u2013172.</ref>\n\n===Last works===\nIn his subsequent works Boulez relinquished electronics, although Griffiths suggests that in ''[[Incises|sur Incises]]'' (1996\u20131998){{refn|The title refers to the fact that the piece elaborates \"on\" the piano piece ''Incises''.|group=n}} the choice of like but distinct instruments, widely spread across the platform, allowed Boulez to create effects of harmonic, timbral and spatial echo for which he had previously needed electronic means. The piece is scored for three pianos, three harps and three percussionists (including steel drums) and grew out of ''Incises'' (1993\u20132001), a short piece written for use in a piano competition.<ref>Griffiths (2005), 105.</ref> In an interview in 2013 he described it as his most important work\u2014\"because it is the freest\".<ref>Boulez (2017), 249.</ref>\n\n''Notation VII'' (1999), marked \"hieratic\" in the score, is the longest of the completed orchestral ''Notations''. According to Griffiths: \"what was abrupt in 1945 is now languorous; what was crude is now done with a lifetime's experience and expertise; what was simple is fantastically embellished, even submerged.\"<ref>Griffiths (2005), 102.</ref>\n\n''D\u00e9rive 2'' began life in 1988 as a five-minute piece, dedicated to Elliott Carter on his 80th birthday; by 2006 it was a 45-minute work for eleven instruments and Boulez's last major composition. According to [[Claude Samuel]], Boulez wanted to delve into the field of rhythmic shifts, tempo changes and superimpositions of different speeds, inspired in part by his contact with the music of Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. Boulez described it as \"a sort of narrative mosaic\".<ref name=SamuelBooklet>Samuel (2013).</ref>\n\n===Unfinished works===\nA distinction may be made between works which Boulez was actively progressing and those which he put to one side despite their potential for further development.  In the latter category, the archives contain three unpublished movements of the Third Piano Sonata<ref>Edwards, 4.</ref> and further sections of ''\u00c9clat/Multiples'' which, if performed, would practically double its length.<ref name=Schaufler>{{cite web|author=Wolfgang Schaufler|url=http://www.universaledition.com/Pierre-Boulez/composers-and-works/composer/88/aboutmusic|title=Pierre Boulez, About the Music|work=Universal Edition website|date=December 2010|accessdate=4 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604050736/http://www.universaledition.com/Pierre-Boulez/composers-and-works/composer/88/aboutmusic|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs for works Boulez was known to be working on in his later years, the premieres of two more orchestral ''Notations'' ''(V'' and ''VI'') were announced by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for May 2006, but postponed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Delacoma |first=Wynne |date=29 March 2006 |title=CSO erases Boulez's latest 'Notations' |url=http://contemporarymusic.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/cso-erases-boulezs-latest-notations.html |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=18 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611162848/http://contemporarymusic.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/cso-erases-boulezs-latest-notations.html |archivedate=11 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He was in the process of developing ''Anth\u00e8mes 2'' into a large-scale work for violin and orchestra for Anne-Sophie Mutter<ref>Shave, Nick.

He gave his first concerts for the Domaine musical because its financial resources were limited: \"I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself.\"<ref>Boulez (2003), 4.</ref> He also said that the best possible training for a composer was \"to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution\"\u2014yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments.<ref>Glock, 133.</ref> The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: \"Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it.\"<ref>Peyser (1976), 147.</ref>\n\nNot everyone agreed about the greatness of that gift. For the conductor [[Otto Klemperer]] he was \"without doubt the only man of his generation who is an outstanding conductor ''and'' musician\".<ref>Heyworth (1973), 120.</ref> For the critic Hans Keller he was \"incapable of phrasing. It's as simple as that&nbsp;... That's why he conducts Bach, Beethoven or Webern in exactly the same way.\"<ref>Vermeil, 169.</ref> Joan Peyser considered that \"in general Boulez conducts what he loves magnificently, conducts what he likes very well and, with rare exceptions, gives stiff performances of the classic and romantic repertoire.\"<ref>Peyser (1976), 210.</ref> He worked with many leading soloists and had particularly long-term collaborations with Daniel Barenboim and [[Jessye Norman]].<ref>Vermeil, 179\u2013244.</ref>\n\nAccording to Peter Heyworth Boulez produced a lean, athletic sound which, underpinned by his rhythmic exactitude, could generate an electric sense of excitement. The ability to reveal the structure of a score and to clarify dense orchestral textures were hallmarks of his conducting. He conducted without a baton and, as Heyworth observed: \"there is no trace of theatre\u2014not even the rather theatrical sort of economy that was practised by Richard Strauss.\"<ref>Heyworth (1986), 25\u201326.</ref> According to Boulez: \"outward excitement uses up inner excitement.\"<ref>Glock, 137.</ref>\n\nBoulez's ear for sound was legendary: \"there are countless stories of him detecting, for example, faulty intonation from the third oboe in a complex orchestral texture,\" Paul Griffiths wrote in ''The New York Times''.<ref name=Griffiths6Jan/> [[Oliver Knussen]], himself a well-known composer-conductor, observed that: \"his rehearsals are models of clear-headedness and professional courtesy\u2014he effortlessly commands respect.\"<ref name=SmallHammer/>\n\n==Opera==\n[[File:Gwyneth Ch\u00e9reau (gro\u00dfer).jpg|thumb|The [[Jahrhundertring|1976 centenary production]] of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at the [[Bayreuth Festival]], conducted by Boulez]]\nBoulez also conducted in the opera house. His chosen repertoire was small and included no Italian opera. Apart from Wagner, he conducted only twentieth-century works.\n\nThings might have been different had his collaboration with Wieland Wagner not ended prematurely. Of their work on ''Wozzeck'' and ''Parsifal'' Boulez said: \"I would willingly have hitched, if not my entire fate, then at least a part of it, to someone like him, for [our] discussions about music and productions were thrilling.\" They planned other productions together, including ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', but by the time rehearsals for their Bayreuth ''Parsifal'' began Wieland was already gravely ill and he died in October 1966.<ref>Boulez (2003), 8; Boulez (2017), 41.</ref>\n\nWhen the Frankfurt ''Wozzeck'' was revived after Wieland's death Boulez was deeply disillusioned by the working conditions: \"there was no rehearsal, no care taken over anything.

Among the first projects were the Paris ''Wozzeck'' (with [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]]) and the Covent Garden ''Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande'' (with [[George Shirley]] and [[Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m]]). He made a highly praised recording of ''The Rite of Spring'' with the Cleveland Orchestra and a number of recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, including rarities such as Berlioz's ''L\u00e9lio'' and the first complete recording of Mahler's ''Das klagende Lied''. The LSO also contributed to the Webern edition which Boulez supervised, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. When he took up his posts with the New York Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras, and later the Ensemble Intercontemporain, he made most of his recordings with them. A particular focus of the Columbia years was a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg, including ''Gurrelieder'' and ''Moses und Aron'', but also less well-known works such as the unaccompanied choral music. As for Boulez's own music, in 1969 there was a first recording of ''Pli selon pli'' (with [[Halina \u0141ukomska]] as soprano soloist) and recordings of ''Rituel'' and ''\u00c9clat/Multiples''.

Generally he avoided publishing detailed analyses, other than one of ''The Rite of Spring''. As Nattiez points out: \"as a writer Boulez is a communicator of ideas rather than of technical information. This may sometimes prove disappointing to composition students, but it is no doubt a peculiarity of his writing that explains its popularity with non-musicians.\"<ref>Boulez (1981), 14.</ref>\n\nBoulez's writings have appeared in English as ''Stocktakings from an Apprenticeship'', ''Boulez on Music Today'' and ''Orientations: Collected Writings''. His Coll\u00e8ge de France lectures were published in English for the first time in 2018 by Faber & Faber under the title ''Pierre Boulez, Music Lessons: The Complete Coll\u00e8ge de France Lectures''. Throughout his career he also expressed himself through long-form interviews, of which perhaps the most substantial are those with [[Antoine Gol\u00e9a]] (1958), C\u00e9lestin Deli\u00e8ge (1975) and Jean Vermeil (1989).<ref>Gol\u00e9a; Boulez (1976); Vermeil.</ref> In addition, two volumes of correspondence have been published: with the composer John Cage (from the period 1949\u201362);<ref>Boulez, Pierre and John Cage.</ref> and with the anthropologist and ethnomusicologist [[Andr\u00e9 Schaeffner]] (from 1954 to 1970).<ref>Boulez, Pierre and Andr\u00e9 Schaeffner.</ref>\n\nBoulez taught at the Darmstadt Summer School most years between 1954 and 1965.<ref>Boulez (1971).</ref> He was professor of composition at the Musik Akademie Basel in Switzerland (1960\u201363) and a visiting lecturer at Harvard University in 1963.

According to George Benjamin \"[Boulez] has produced a catalogue of wondrously luminous and scintillating works. Within them a rigorous compositional skill is coupled to an imagination of extraordinary aural refinement\". For Oliver Knussen he was \"a man who fashions his scores with the fanatical idealism of a medieval monk minutely illuminating volumes\". By contrast, John Adams described him as \"a mannerist, a niche composer, a master who worked with a very small hammer\".

He was one of the dominant figures of the post-war classical music world.\n\nBorn in [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]] in the Loire department of France, the son of an engineer, Boulez studied at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] with [[Olivier Messiaen]], and privately with [[Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]]. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as music director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in [[avant-garde music]], playing an important role in the development of [[integral serialism]] and [[Aleatoric music|controlled chance music]]. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as ''[[Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre]]'', ''[[Pli selon pli]]'' and ''[[R\u00e9pons]]''. His uncompromising commitment to modernism and the trenchant, [[polemic]]al tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist.\n\nIn parallel with his activities as a composer Boulez became one of the most prominent conductors of his generation. In a career lasting more than sixty years he held the positions of chief conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], music director of the [[Ensemble Intercontemporain]] and principal guest conductor of the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]]. He made frequent guest appearances with many of the world's other great orchestras, including the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra|Vienna Philharmonic]], the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra|Berlin Philharmonic]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. He was particularly known for his performances of the music of the first half of the twentieth century\u2014including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]], and the [[Second Viennese School]]\u2014as well as that of his contemporaries, such as [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti|Ligeti]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Elliott Carter|Carter]]. His work in the opera house included the ''[[Jahrhundertring]]''\u2014the production of [[Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''Ring'' cycle]] for the centenary of the [[Bayreuth Festival]]\u2014and the world premiere of the three-act version of [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''. His recorded legacy is extensive.\n\nHe founded a number of musical institutions in Paris, including the [[Domaine Musical]], the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique ([[IRCAM]]), the Ensemble Intercontemporain and the [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique]], as well as the [[Lucerne Festival Academy]] in Switzerland.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===1925\u20131943: Childhood and school days===\nPierre Boulez was born on 26 March 1925, in [[Montbrison, Loire|Montbrison]], a small town\nin the [[Loire (department)|Loire department]] of east-central France, to L\u00e9on and Marcelle (''n\u00e9e'' Calabre) Boulez.<ref name=Nichols6Jan>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/pierre-boulez|title=Pierre Boulez obituary|work=The Guardian|first=Roger|last=Nichols|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=6 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106151953/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/06/pierre-boulez|archivedate=6 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was the third of four children: an older sister, Jeanne (1922\u20132018)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.francemusique.fr/actualite-musicale/mort-de-jeanne-boulez-chevalier-soeur-de-pierre-boulez-64349 |title=Mort de Jeanne Boulez-Chevalier, soeur de Pierre Boulez |last1=Decalf |first1=Guillaume |date=9 August 2018 |website=France Musique |access-date=10 August 2018}}</ref> and younger brother, Roger (b. 1936) were preceded by a first child, also called Pierre (b. 1920), who died in infancy. L\u00e9on (1891\u20131969), an engineer and technical director of a steel factory, is described by biographers as an authoritarian figure, but with a strong sense of fairness; Marcelle (1897\u20131985) as an outgoing, good-humoured woman, who deferred to her husband's strict Catholic beliefs, while not necessarily sharing them. The family prospered, moving in 1929 from the apartment above a pharmacy, where Boulez was born, to a comfortable detached house, where he spent most of his childhood.<ref>Peyser (1976), 21\u201322; Heyworth (1986), 3; [[Dominique Jameux|Jameux 3]].</ref>\n\nFrom the age of seven Boulez went to school at the Institut Victor de Laprade, a Catholic seminary where the thirteen-hour school day was filled with study and prayer.

Impressed by his ability, she persuaded L\u00e9on to allow his son to apply to the [[Conservatoire national sup\u00e9rieur de musique et de danse de Lyon|Conservatoire in Lyon]]. The selection board rejected him but Boulez was determined to pursue a career in music. The following year, with his sister's support in the face of opposition from his father, he studied the piano and harmony privately with Lionel de Pachmann (son of the pianist [[Vladimir de Pachmann|Vladimir]]).<ref>Peyser (1976), 24\u201325; Jameux, 6\u20137; Heyworth (1986), 4.</ref> \"Our parents were strong, but finally we were stronger than they\", Boulez later said.<ref>Peyser (1976), 24.</ref> In fact, when he moved to Paris in the autumn of 1943, hoping to enrol at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], L\u00e9on accompanied him, helped him to find a room (in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th arrondissement]]) and subsidised him until he could earn a living.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 4; Hill and Simeone, 139; O'Hagan, 9.</ref>\n\n===1943\u20131946: Musical education===\nIn October 1943, he auditioned unsuccessfully for the advanced piano class at the Conservatoire, but he was admitted in January 1944 to the preparatory harmony class of [[Georges Dandelot]].

He greatly enjoyed working with her and she remembered him as an exceptional student, using his exercises as models in advanced counterpoint until the end of her teaching career.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 5; Archimbaud, 24.</ref> In the autumn he joined [[Olivier Messiaen|Olivier Messiaen's]] advanced harmony class at the Conservatoire and attended the private seminars which Messiaen gave to chosen students, where key works of the early twentieth century, including Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', were subjected to intensive analysis.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 9.</ref>\n\nIn January 1945 Boulez moved to two small attic rooms in the [[Le Marais|Marais]] district of Paris, where he lived for the next fourteen years.<ref>Barbedette, 212; Peyser, 30.</ref> The following month he attended a private performance of Schoenberg's [[Wind Quintet (Schoenberg)|Wind Quintet]], conducted by [[Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz]], the composer and follower of Schoenberg. Its strict use of [[twelve-tone technique]] was a revelation to him and he organised a group of fellow students to take private lessons with Leibowitz.

New works included the [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)|first two piano sonatas]] and initial versions of two cantatas on poems by [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], ''[[Le Visage nuptial]]''{{refn|The Nuptial Countenance.|group=n|name=visage}} and ''[[Le Soleil des eaux]]''.<ref>Samuel (2002), 421\u201322.</ref>{{refn|The Sun of the Waters,|group=n|name=soleil}} In October 1951 a substantial work for eighteen solo instruments, ''[[Polyphonie X]]'', caused a scandal at its premiere at the [[Donaueschingen Festival]], some audience members disrupting the performance with hisses and whistles.<ref>Peyser (1976), 66.</ref>\n\nAround this time he met two composers who were to be important influences: [[John Cage]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers ([[Heugel (music publisher)|Heugel]] and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage's ''[[Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano]]''.<ref>Peyser (1976), 60\u201361; Boulez and Cage, 41\u201348.</ref> When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence about the future of music.

As well as Stockhausen, Boulez was in contact there with other composers who would become significant figures in contemporary music, including [[Luciano Berio]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Bruno Maderna]], and [[Henri Pousseur]]. Boulez quickly became one of the leaders of the post-war modernist movement in the arts.

The concerts focused initially on three areas: pre-war classics still unfamiliar in Paris (such as Bart\u00f3k and Webern), works by the new generation (Stockhausen, Nono) and neglected masters from the past ([[Machaut]], [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]])\u2014although for practical reasons the last category fell away in subsequent seasons.<ref>Jameux 61\u201362, 71\u201372.</ref> Boulez proved an energetic and accomplished administrator and the concerts were an immediate success.<ref>Heyworth (1986), 21; Jameux, 62\u201364; Campbell and O'Hagan, 9; Aguila, 55.</ref> They attracted musicians, painters and writers, as well as fashionable society, but they were so costly that Boulez had to turn to wealthy private patrons for support.<ref>Jameux, 65\u201367; Peyser (1976), 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nKey events in the Domaine's history included a Webern festival (1955), the European premiere of Stravinsky's ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]'' (1957) and first performances of Messiaen's ''[[Oiseaux exotiques]]'' (1955) and ''Sept Ha\u00efka\u00ef'' (1963).

A serial work of great energy, its single-movement form was influenced by Schoenberg's [[Chamber Symphony No. 1 (Schoenberg)|Chamber Symphony No. 1]].<ref>Jameux, 228.</ref> Bennett finds in the piece a tone new to Boulez's writing: \"a sharp, brittle violence juxtaposed against an extreme sensitivity and delicacy\".<ref>Bennett, 57.</ref> In the [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)|Piano Sonata No. 1]] (1946\u201349) the biographer [[Dominique Jameux]] highlights the sheer number of different kinds of attack in its two short movements\u2014and the frequent accelerations of tempo in the second movement\u2014which together suggest the feeling of \"instrumental delirium\".<ref>Jameux, 239.</ref>\n\nThere followed two cantatas based on the poetry of [[Ren\u00e9 Char]]. Of ''Le Visage nuptial''{{refn|group=n|name=visage}} [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] observes that \"Char's five poems speak in hard-edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion\", which Boulez reflected in music \"on the borders of fevered hysteria\". In its original version (1946\u201347) the piece was scored for small forces (soprano, contralto, two ondes Martenot, piano and percussion). Forty years later Boulez arrived at the definitive version for soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra (1985\u20131989).<ref name=Visage /> ''Le Soleil des eaux''{{refn|group=n|name=soleil}} (1948) originated in incidental music for a radio drama by Char.

Of the two middle movements Boulez said: \"I tried to disintegrate slow movement form by the use of the trope, and repetitive scherzo form by the use of variation form.\"<ref>Boulez (1975), 41\u201342.</ref> For Griffiths the violent character of much of the music \"is not just superficial: it is expressive of a whole aesthetic of annihilation, and in particular of a need to obliterate what had gone before\".<ref name=\"Griffiths 1978, 16\">Griffiths (1978), 16.</ref> Boulez played the work for [[Aaron Copland]], who asked: \"But must we start a revolution all over again?\"\u2014\"Yes, mercilessly\", Boulez replied.<ref>Ross, 378.</ref>\n\n===Total serialism===\nThat revolution entered its most extreme phase in 1950\u20131952, when Boulez developed a technique in which not only pitch but other musical parameters\u2014duration, dynamics, timbre and attack\u2014were organised according to serial principles, an approach known as total [[serialism]] or [[punctualism]]. Messiaen had already made an experiment in this direction in his ''Mode de valeurs et d'intensit\u00e9s''{{refn|Mode of Duration and Dynamics.|group=n}} for piano (1949). Boulez's first sketches towards total serialism appeared in parts of ''Livre pour quatuor'' (Book for Quartet, 1948\u201349, revised 2011\u201312), a collection of movements for string quartet from which the players may choose at any one performance, foreshadowing Boulez's later interest in variable form.<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\">Hopkins and Griffiths.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s Boulez began to apply the technique rigorously, ordering each parameter into sets of twelve and prescribing no repetition until all twelve had sounded. According to the music critic Alex Ross the resulting surfeit of ever-changing musical data has the effect of erasing at any given point previous impressions the listener may have formed: \"the present moment is all there is\".<ref>Ross, 363\u2013364.</ref> Boulez linked this development to a desire by his generation to create a ''tabula rasa'' after the war.<ref name=Toronyi-Lalic>{{cite news|last=Toronyi-Lalic|first=Igor|date=20 July 2012|title=theartsdesk Q&A: Composer Pierre Boulez|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/theartsdesk-qa-composer-pierre-boulez|newspaper=theartsdesk|access-date=14 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319022849/http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/theartsdesk-qa-composer-pierre-boulez|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHis works in this idiom are ''[[Polyphonie X]]'' (1950{{ndash}}51; withdrawn) for 18 instruments, the two ''[[musique concr\u00e8te]]'' ''[[\u00e9tude]]s'' (1951\u201352; withdrawn), and ''[[Structures (Boulez)|Structures, Book I]]'' for two pianos (1951\u201352).<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/> Speaking of ''Structures, Book I'' in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which \"the responsibility of the composer is practically absent.

Recognising a lack of expressive flexibility in the language (described in his essay \"At the Limit of Fertile Land...\"),<ref>Boulez (1991), 162.</ref> Boulez loosened the strictness of total serialism into a more supple and strongly gestural music: \"I am trying to rid myself of my thumbprints and taboos\", he wrote to Cage.<ref>Campbell, 13.</ref> The most significant result of this new freedom was ''Le Marteau sans ma\u00eetre''{{refn|group=n|name=marteau}} (1953\u20131955), described by Griffiths and [[Bill Hopkins (composer)|Bill Hopkins]] as a \"keystone of twentieth-century music\".<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/> Three short poems by Char form the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (one is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring.<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/> The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, [[xylorimba]], vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, to which he had always been attracted.<ref>Boulez (1976), 67.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stephane Mallarme.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=head and shoulders photograph of middle-aged white man with neat beard full head of greying hair|St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]]\nFor the text of his next major work, ''[[Pli selon pli]]''{{refn|group=n|name=pli}} (1957\u20131989), Boulez turned to the symbolist poetry of Stephane Mallarm\u00e9, attracted by its extreme density and radical syntax.<ref>Boulez (1976), 93.</ref> At seventy minutes, it is his longest composition. Three ''Improvisations''\u2014of increasing complexity\u2014on individual sonnets are framed by two orchestral movements, into which fragments of other poems are embedded.<ref>Guldbrandsen.</ref> Boulez's word-setting, which in the first Improvisation is straightforwardly syllabic, becomes ever more [[melisma]]tic, to the point where the words cannot be distinguished. Boulez's stated aim was to make the sonnets ''become'' the music at a deeper, structural level.<ref>Bradshaw, 186.</ref> The piece is scored for soprano and large orchestra, often deployed in chamber groups. Boulez described its sound-world, rich in percussion, as \"not so much frozen as extraordinarily 'vitrified{{'\"}}.<ref>Boulez (1976), 94.</ref> The work had a complex genesis, reaching its definitive form in 1989.<ref>Samuel (2002), 424\u201325.</ref>\n\n===Controlled chance===\nFrom the 1950s Boulez experimented with what he called \"controlled chance\" and he developed his views on [[aleatoric music]] in the articles \"Al\u00e9a\"<ref>Boulez (1991), 26\u201338.</ref> and \"Sonate, que me veux-tu?\"{{refn|What do you want from me, sonata?|group=n}}, in which he wrote of \"the investigation of a relative world, a permanent 'discovering' rather like the state of 'permanent revolution{{'\"}}.<ref>Boulez (1986), 143.</ref>\n\nPeyser observes that Boulez's use of chance is very different from that in the works of John Cage. While in Cage's music the performers are often given the freedom to create completely unforeseen sounds, with the object of removing the composer's intention from the music, in Boulez's music they may only choose between possibilities that have been written out in detail by the composer.<ref>Peyser (1976), 126\u2013129</ref> This method, when applied to the successional order of sections, is often described as \"mobile form\", a technique innovated by the composer [[Earle Brown]] and inspired by the mobile sculptures of [[Alexander Calder]], to whom Brown and Cage introduced Boulez when he was visiting New York in 1952.<ref>Barbedette, 143; Borchardt-Hume, 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nBoulez employed variants of the technique in a number of works over the next two decades: in the [[Piano sonatas (Boulez)#Third Piano Sonata|Third Piano Sonata]] (1955\u20131957, revised 1963) the pianist may choose different routes through the score and in one movement (''Trope'') has the option of omitting certain passages altogether;<ref>Gardner and O'Hagan, 179.</ref> in ''\u00c9clat''{{refn|group=n|name=eclat}} (1965), the conductor triggers the order in which each player joins the ensemble; in ''Domaines'' (1961\u20131968) it is the soloist who dictates the order in which the sections are played by his movement around the stage. In later works, such as ''Cummings ist der Dichter''{{refn|Cummings is the Poet.|group=n}} (1970, revised 1986)\u2014a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by [[E. E. Cummings]]\u2014the conductor is given choice as to the order of certain events but there is no freedom for the individual player. In its original version ''Pli selon pli'' also contained elements of choice for the instrumentalists, but much of this was eliminated in later revisions.\n\nBy contrast ''Figures\u2014Doubles\u2014Prismes'' (1957\u20131968) is a fixed work with no chance element. Piencikowski describes it as \"a great cycle of variations whose components interpenetrate each other instead of remaining isolated in the traditional manner\".<ref>Piencikowski.</ref> It is notable for the unusual layout of the orchestra, in which the various families of instruments (woodwind, brass etc.) are scattered across the stage rather than being grouped together.<ref>Boulez (2003), 101.</ref>\n\n===Middle-period works===\nJonathan Goldman identifies a major aesthetic shift in Boulez's work from the mid-1970s onwards, characterised variously by the presence of thematic writing, a return to vertical harmony and to clarity and legibility of form.<ref>Goldman, xv\u2013xvi.</ref> Boulez himself said: \"the ''envelope'' is simpler. The contents are not&nbsp;... I think in my recent work it is true that the first approach is more direct, and the gesture is more obvious, let's say.\"<ref>Ford, 23.</ref> The works from this period are amongst his most frequently performed.\n\nFor Goldman, ''[[Rituel in memoriam Bruno Maderna]]'' (1974\u201375) marks the beginning of this development. Boulez wrote this twenty-five minute work as an epitaph for his friend and colleague, the Italian composer and conductor, who died in 1973 at the age of 53. The piece is divided into fifteen sections, the orchestra into eight groups. While the odd-numbered sections are conducted, in the even sections the conductor merely sets each group in motion and its progress is regulated by a percussionist beating time. In his dedication Boulez described the work as \"a ritual of disappearance and survival\";<ref name=SamuelBooklet /> Griffiths refers to the work's \"awesome grandeur\".<ref>Griffiths (1978), 58\u201359.</ref>\n\n''Notations I\u2013IV'' (1980) are the first four transformations of piano miniatures from 1945 into pieces for very large orchestra. In his review of the New York premiere, [[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Andrew Porter]] wrote that the single idea of each original piece  \"has, as it were, been passed through a many-faceted bright prism and broken into a thousand linked, lapped, sparkling fragments\", the finale \"a terse modern ''Rite''&nbsp;... which sets the pulses racing\".<ref>Porter, 88.</ref>\n\n''[[D\u00e9rive 1]]''{{refn|Explaining the title in a letter to Glock, Boulez referred to the fact that the music \"derived\" from material in ''R\u00e9pons'' but also that one meaning of \"d\u00e9rive\" is the drifting of a boat in the wind or current.<ref>Glock, 174.</ref>|group=n}} (1984), dedicated to [[William Glock]] on his retirement from the Bath Festival,<ref name=\"Glock, 139\"/> is a short quintet in which the piano takes the lead. The material is derived from six chords and, according to Ivan Hewett, the piece \"shuffles and decorates these chords, bursting outwards in spirals and eddies, before returning to its starting point\". At the end the music \"shivers into silence\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Hewett|first=Ivan|date=26 September 2013|title=Ivan Hewett's Classic 50 No 39: Pierre Boulez\u2014D\u00e9rive 1|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classical-music-guide/10314695/Ivan-Hewetts-Classic-50-No-39-Pierre-Boulez-Derive-1.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=1 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102082508/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classical-music-guide/10314695/Ivan-Hewetts-Classic-50-No-39-Pierre-Boulez-Derive-1.html|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Works with electronics===\nBoulez likened the experience of listening to pre-recorded electronic music in the concert hall to a crematorium ceremony. His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of live instrumental sounds but the technology did not become available until the late 1970s and the founding of IRCAM. Before then he had produced ''Deux Etudes'' (1951) for [[magnetic tape]] for [[Pierre Schaeffer]]'s Groupe Recherche de la Radiodiffusion Fran\u00e7aise,<ref>Peyser (1976), 67.</ref> as well as a large-scale piece for live orchestra with tape, ''Po\u00e9sie pour pouvoir'' (1958){{refn|group=n|name=poesie}}. He was dissatisfied with both pieces and withdrew them.<ref>Rocco, 67; \"An Interview with [[Dominique Jameux]]\", in Boulez (1981), 201\u201302; Jameux, 114\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe first piece completed at IRCAM was ''[[R\u00e9pons]]'' (1980\u20131984).{{refn|The title is a reference to plainchant, in which the solo singer alternates with a choir. It reflects the interplay between the soloists and the ensemble (or, as Samuel puts it: the individual and the community).<ref>Samuel (2013)</ref>|group=n}} In this forty-minute work an instrumental ensemble is placed in the middle of the hall, while six soloists encircle the audience: two pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone and glockenspiel/xylophone. It is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through the space. [[Peter Heyworth]] described the moment at which they enter, some ten minutes into the piece: \"it is as though a great window were thrown open, through which a new sound world enters, and with it a new world of the imagination. Even more impressive is the fact that there is no longer a schism between the worlds of natural and electronic sounds, but rather a continuous spectrum.\"<ref>Heyworth (1982).</ref>\n\n''[[Dialogue de l'ombre double]]'' (1982\u20131985){{refn|Dialogue of the Double Shadow. The title refers to a scene in [[Paul Claudel|Paul Claudel's]] play ''Le Soulier de satin'' (The Satin Slipper). Boulez acknowledged that the work had a theatrical aspect.<ref name=SamuelBooklet />|group=n}} for clarinet and electronics grew out of a fragment of ''Domaines'' and was a gift for Luciano Berio on his 60th birthday. Lasting around eighteen minutes, it is a dialogue between a solo clarinet (played live, though sometimes reverberated through an offstage piano) and its double (in passages pre-recorded by the same musician and projected around the hall). Boulez approved transcriptions of the piece for bassoon (in 1995) and for recorder (in 2011).\n\nIn the early 1970s he had worked on an extended chamber piece called ''\u2026explosante-fixe\u2026''{{refn|The title of the work is a quotation from [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]]'s ''L'Amour fou'': \"convulsive beauty will be erotic-veiled, exploding-fixed, magic-circumstantial, or it will not be.\"<ref name=SamuelBooklet/>|group=n}} for eight solo instruments, electronically transformed by a machine called a halophone, but the technology was still primitive and he eventually withdrew it.<ref>Vermeil, 207, 209 and 210; Jameux, 176\u201377.</ref> He re-used some of its material in other works, including a later piece with the same name.<ref>Campbell and O'Hagan, 297.</ref> This definitive version, recorded commercially, was composed at IRCAM between 1991 and 1993 for [[MIDI|MIDI-flute]] and two accompanying flutes with ensemble and live electronics. By this time the technology was such that the computer could follow the score and respond to triggers from the players.<ref>Rocco, 68.</ref> According to Griffiths, \"the principal flute is caught as if in a hall of mirrors, its line imitated in what the other flutes play, and then in the contributions of the larger ensemble.\".<ref>Griffiths (1995b)</ref> Hopkins and Griffiths describe it as \"music characteristically caught between thrill and desperation\".<ref name=\"Hopkins and Griffiths\"/>\n\n''[[Anth\u00e8mes|Anth\u00e8mes II]]'' for violin and electronics (1997) grew out of a piece for solo violin ''Anth\u00e8mes I'' (1991), which Boulez wrote for the Yehudi Menuhin Violin Competition in Paris and which in turn derived from material in the original ''\u2026explosante-fixe\u2026''<ref name=SamuelBooklet/> The virtuoso writing for the instrument is captured by the electronic system, transformed in real time and propelled around the space to create what Jonathan Goldman calls a \"hyper-violin\". Although this gives rise to effects of speed and complexity which no violinist could achieve, Boulez restricts the palette of electronic sounds so that their source, the violin, is always recognisable.<ref>Goldman, 169\u2013172.</ref>\n\n===Last works===\nIn his subsequent works Boulez relinquished electronics, although Griffiths suggests that in ''[[Incises|sur Incises]]'' (1996\u20131998){{refn|The title refers to the fact that the piece elaborates \"on\" the piano piece ''Incises''.|group=n}} the choice of like but distinct instruments, widely spread across the platform, allowed Boulez to create effects of harmonic, timbral and spatial echo for which he had previously needed electronic means. The piece is scored for three pianos, three harps and three percussionists (including steel drums) and grew out of ''Incises'' (1993\u20132001), a short piece written for use in a piano competition.<ref>Griffiths (2005), 105.</ref> In an interview in 2013 he described it as his most important work\u2014\"because it is the freest\".<ref>Boulez (2017), 249.</ref>\n\n''Notation VII'' (1999), marked \"hieratic\" in the score, is the longest of the completed orchestral ''Notations''. According to Griffiths: \"what was abrupt in 1945 is now languorous; what was crude is now done with a lifetime's experience and expertise; what was simple is fantastically embellished, even submerged.\"<ref>Griffiths (2005), 102.</ref>\n\n''D\u00e9rive 2'' began life in 1988 as a five-minute piece, dedicated to Elliott Carter on his 80th birthday; by 2006 it was a 45-minute work for eleven instruments and Boulez's last major composition. According to [[Claude Samuel]], Boulez wanted to delve into the field of rhythmic shifts, tempo changes and superimpositions of different speeds, inspired in part by his contact with the music of Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti. Boulez described it as \"a sort of narrative mosaic\".<ref name=SamuelBooklet>Samuel (2013).</ref>\n\n===Unfinished works===\nA distinction may be made between works which Boulez was actively progressing and those which he put to one side despite their potential for further development.  In the latter category, the archives contain three unpublished movements of the Third Piano Sonata<ref>Edwards, 4.</ref> and further sections of ''\u00c9clat/Multiples'' which, if performed, would practically double its length.<ref name=Schaufler>{{cite web|author=Wolfgang Schaufler|url=http://www.universaledition.com/Pierre-Boulez/composers-and-works/composer/88/aboutmusic|title=Pierre Boulez, About the Music|work=Universal Edition website|date=December 2010|accessdate=4 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604050736/http://www.universaledition.com/Pierre-Boulez/composers-and-works/composer/88/aboutmusic|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAs for works Boulez was known to be working on in his later years, the premieres of two more orchestral ''Notations'' ''(V'' and ''VI'') were announced by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for May 2006, but postponed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Delacoma |first=Wynne |date=29 March 2006 |title=CSO erases Boulez's latest 'Notations' |url=http://contemporarymusic.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/cso-erases-boulezs-latest-notations.html |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |access-date=18 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611162848/http://contemporarymusic.blogspot.co.uk/2006/03/cso-erases-boulezs-latest-notations.html |archivedate=11 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He was in the process of developing ''Anth\u00e8mes 2'' into a large-scale work for violin and orchestra for Anne-Sophie Mutter<ref>Shave, Nick.

He gave his first concerts for the Domaine musical because its financial resources were limited: \"I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself.\"<ref>Boulez (2003), 4.</ref> He also said that the best possible training for a composer was \"to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution\"\u2014yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments.<ref>Glock, 133.</ref> The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: \"Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it.\"<ref>Peyser (1976), 147.</ref>\n\nNot everyone agreed about the greatness of that gift.

The ability to reveal the structure of a score and to clarify dense orchestral textures were hallmarks of his conducting. He conducted without a baton and, as Heyworth observed: \"there is no trace of theatre\u2014not even the rather theatrical sort of economy that was practised by Richard Strauss.\"<ref>Heyworth (1986), 25\u201326.</ref> According to Boulez: \"outward excitement uses up inner excitement.\"<ref>Glock, 137.</ref>\n\nBoulez's ear for sound was legendary: \"there are countless stories of him detecting, for example, faulty intonation from the third oboe in a complex orchestral texture,\" Paul Griffiths wrote in ''The New York Times''.<ref name=Griffiths6Jan/> [[Oliver Knussen]], himself a well-known composer-conductor, observed that: \"his rehearsals are models of clear-headedness and professional courtesy\u2014he effortlessly commands respect.\"<ref name=SmallHammer/>\n\n==Opera==\n[[File:Gwyneth Ch\u00e9reau (gro\u00dfer).jpg|thumb|The [[Jahrhundertring|1976 centenary production]] of ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' at the [[Bayreuth Festival]], conducted by Boulez]]\nBoulez also conducted in the opera house. His chosen repertoire was small and included no Italian opera. Apart from Wagner, he conducted only twentieth-century works.\n\nThings might have been different had his collaboration with Wieland Wagner not ended prematurely. Of their work on ''Wozzeck'' and ''Parsifal'' Boulez said: \"I would willingly have hitched, if not my entire fate, then at least a part of it, to someone like him, for [our] discussions about music and productions were thrilling.\" They planned other productions together, including ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', but by the time rehearsals for their Bayreuth ''Parsifal'' began Wieland was already gravely ill and he died in October 1966.<ref>Boulez (2003), 8; Boulez (2017), 41.</ref>\n\nWhen the Frankfurt ''Wozzeck'' was revived after Wieland's death Boulez was deeply disillusioned by the working conditions: \"there was no rehearsal, no care taken over anything.

Among the first projects were the Paris ''Wozzeck'' (with [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]]) and the Covent Garden ''Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande'' (with [[George Shirley]] and [[Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m]]). He made a highly praised recording of ''The Rite of Spring'' with the Cleveland Orchestra and a number of recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, including rarities such as Berlioz's ''L\u00e9lio'' and the first complete recording of Mahler's ''Das klagende Lied''. The LSO also contributed to the Webern edition which Boulez supervised, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. When he took up his posts with the New York Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras, and later the Ensemble Intercontemporain, he made most of his recordings with them. A particular focus of the Columbia years was a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg, including ''Gurrelieder'' and ''Moses und Aron'', but also less well-known works such as the unaccompanied choral music. As for Boulez's own music, in 1969 there was a first recording of ''Pli selon pli'' (with [[Halina \u0141ukomska]] as soprano soloist) and recordings of ''Rituel'' and ''\u00c9clat/Multiples''.

Generally he avoided publishing detailed analyses, other than one of ''The Rite of Spring''. As Nattiez points out: \"as a writer Boulez is a communicator of ideas rather than of technical information. This may sometimes prove disappointing to composition students, but it is no doubt a peculiarity of his writing that explains its popularity with non-musicians.\"<ref>Boulez (1981), 14.</ref>\n\nBoulez's writings have appeared in English as ''Stocktakings from an Apprenticeship'', ''Boulez on Music Today'' and ''Orientations: Collected Writings''. His Coll\u00e8ge de France lectures were published in English for the first time in 2018 by Faber & Faber under the title ''Pierre Boulez, Music Lessons: The Complete Coll\u00e8ge de France Lectures''. Throughout his career he also expressed himself through long-form interviews, of which perhaps the most substantial are those with [[Antoine Gol\u00e9a]] (1958), C\u00e9lestin Deli\u00e8ge (1975) and Jean Vermeil (1989).<ref>Gol\u00e9a; Boulez (1976); Vermeil.</ref> In addition, two volumes of correspondence have been published: with the composer John Cage (from the period 1949\u201362);<ref>Boulez, Pierre and John Cage.</ref> and with the anthropologist and ethnomusicologist [[Andr\u00e9 Schaeffner]] (from 1954 to 1970).<ref>Boulez, Pierre and Andr\u00e9 Schaeffner.</ref>\n\nBoulez taught at the Darmstadt Summer School most years between 1954 and 1965.<ref>Boulez (1971).</ref> He was professor of composition at the Musik Akademie Basel in Switzerland (1960\u201363) and a visiting lecturer at Harvard University in 1963.

Within them a rigorous compositional skill is coupled to an imagination of extraordinary aural refinement\". For Oliver Knussen he was \"a man who fashions his scores with the fanatical idealism of a medieval monk minutely illuminating volumes\". By contrast, John Adams described him as \"a mannerist, a niche composer, a master who worked with a very small hammer\".

The 8010 workstations were also sold with software based on the programming languages [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[Smalltalk]], for the smaller research and [[software development]] market.\n\n==History==\n===The Xerox Alto===\n{{Main|Xerox Alto}}\nThe Xerox Star systems concept owes much to the Xerox Alto, an experimental workstation designed by the [[PARC (company)|Xerox Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC). The first Alto became operational in 1972. At first, only a few Altos were built.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=D.|author2=Irby, C. |author3=Kimball, R. |author4=Verplank, B. |author5=Harslem, E. |title=Designing the Star User Interface|journal=Byte |year=1982 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=242\u2013282 |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n243/mode/2up}}</ref> Although by 1979 nearly 1,000 Ethernet-linked Altos were in use at Xerox and another 500 at collaborating universities and government offices,<ref name=\"parchis\">{{cite web |url=http://www.parc.com/about/history/ |title=PARC Milestones |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> it was never intended to be a commercial product.<ref name=fumble>{{cite book\n | author = Douglas K.

When the resulting Xerox Star system was announced in 1981,<ref name=\"parchis\"/> the cost was about $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|75000|1981|r=-3|fmt=c}} in today's dollars) for a basic system, and $16,000 (${{Inflation|US|16000|1981|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) for each added workstation.\n\n===The Xerox Star development process===\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\nThe Star was developed at Xerox's Systems Development Department (SDD) in [[El Segundo, California]], which had been established in 1977 {{citation needed|date=February 2019}} under the direction of Don Massaro. A section of SDD, ''SDD North'', was located in [[Palo Alto]], California, and included some people borrowed from PARC. SDD's mission was to design the \"[[Office of the future]]\", a new system that would incorporate the best features of the Alto, was easy to use, and could automate many office tasks.\n\nThe development team was headed by [[David Liddle]], and would eventually grow to more than 200 developers. A good part of the first year was taken up by meetings and planning, the result of which was an extensive and detailed functional specification, internally termed the \"Red Book\". This became the bible for all development tasks. It defined the interface and enforced consistency in all modules and tasks. All changes to the functional specification had to be approved by a review team which maintained standards rigorously.\n\nOne group in Palo Alto worked on the underlying [[operating system]] interface to the hardware and programming tools. Teams in El Segundo and Palo Alto collaborated on developing the user interface and user applications.\n\nThe staff relied heavily on the technologies they were working on, file sharing, print servers and e-mail. They were even connected to the [[Internet]], then named [[Arpanet]], which helped them communicate between El Segundo and Palo Alto.\n\nThe Star was implemented in the programming language [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa]], a direct precursor to [[Modula-2]] and [[Modula-3]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.modulaware.com/mdlt52.htm\n | title = A Brief History of Modula and Lilith\n | author = Niklaus Wirth\n | date=January 1995\n | work = The ModulaTor Oberon-2 and Modula-2 Technical Publication\n | publisher = modulaware.com\n}}</ref> Mesa was not [[object-oriented]], but tools and programming techniques were developed which allowed pseudo object-oriented design and programming. Mesa required creating two files for every module. A definition module specified data structures and procedures for each object, and one or more implementation modules contained the code for the procedures.\n\nThe Star team used a sophisticated [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), named internally ''Tajo'' and externally ''[[Xerox Development Environment]]'' (XDE). Tajo had many similarities with the [[Smalltalk]]-80 environment, but it had many added tools. For example, the [[version control]] system DF, which required programmers to check out modules before they could be changed. Any change in a module which would force changes in dependent modules were closely tracked and documented. Changes to lower level modules required various levels of approval.\n\nThe software development process was intense. It involved much [[prototyping]] and user testing. The [[software engineering|software engineers]] had to develop new network [[communications protocol]]s and data-encoding schemes when those used in PARC's research environment proved inadequate.\n\nInitially, all development was done on Alto workstations. These were not well suited to the extreme burdens placed by the software. Even the processor intended for the product proved inadequate and involved a last minute hardware redesign. Many software redesigns, rewrites, and late additions had to be made, variously based on results from user testing, and marketing and systems considerations.\n\nA [[Japanese language]] version of the system was produced in conjunction with [[Fuji Xerox]], code named ''J-Star'', and full support for international customers.\n\nIn the end, many features from the Star Functional Specification were not implemented. The product had to get to market, and the last several months before release focused on reliability and performance.\n\n==System features==\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:Xerox 8010 compound document.jpg|thumb|right|Compound document and desktop of 8010/40 system]]\n[[File:Evolution of the document icon shape.jpg|thumb|Evolution of the used document icon shape]]\n\nThe key philosophy of the user interface was to mimic the office paradigm as much as possible in order to make it intuitive for users. The concept of ''what you see is what you get'' ([[WYSIWYG]]) was considered paramount. Text would be displayed as black on a white background, just like paper, and the printer would replicate the screen using [[Interpress]], a page description language developed at PARC.\n\nOne of the main designers of the Star, Dr. [[David Canfield Smith]], invented the concept of [[computer icon]]s and the desktop metaphor, in which the user would see a desktop that contained documents and folders, with different icons representing different types of documents.<ref name=\"MIT\">{{cite paper |last= Lieberman |first= Henry |title= A Creative Programming Environment, Remixed |citeseerx=10.1.1.125.4685 |publisher= MIT Media Lab |location= Cambridge}}</ref><ref name=\"Nader\">Salha, Nader.

[https://books.google.com/books/about/Pygmalion.html?id=mihHAAAAIAAJ \"Pygmalion: A Creative Programming Environment\"], 1975.</ref> Clicking any icon would open a window. Users would not start programs first (e.g., a text editor, graphics program or spreadsheet software), they would simply open the file and the appropriate application would appear.\n\nThe Star user interface was based on the concept of objects. For example, a word processing document would hold page objects, paragraph objects, sentence objects, word objects, and character objects. The user could select objects by clicking on them with the mouse, and press dedicated special keys on the keyboard to invoke standard object functions (open, delete, copy, move) in a uniform way. There was also a \"Show Properties\" key used to display settings, called property sheets, for the particular object (e.g., font size for a character object). These general conventions greatly simplified the menu structure of all the programs.\n\nObject integration was designed into the system from the start. For example, a chart object created in the graphing module could be inserted into any type of document. This type of ability eventually became available as part of the [[operating system]] on the [[Apple Lisa]] and was featured in Mac OS [[System 7]] as [[Publish and Subscribe (Mac OS)|Publish and Subscribe]]. It became available on [[Microsoft Windows]] with the introduction of [[Object Linking and Embedding]] (OLE) in 1990. This approach was also later used on the [[OpenDoc]] software platform in the mid-to-late 1990s, and in the [[AppleWorks]] (originally ClarisWorks) package available for the Apple Mac (1991) and Microsoft Windows (1993).\n\n===Hardware===\nInitially, the Star software was to run on a new series of virtual-memory processors, described in a PARC technical report called, \"''Wildflower: An Architecture for a Personal Computer''\", by Butler Lampson. The machines had names that always began with the letter ''D''. They were all [[microcode|microprogrammed]] processors; for the Star software, the microcode implemented an instruction set designed for Mesa.\n\nThe first of these machines was the Dolphin, built with [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL) technology, including [[74181|74S181]] ALUs. The complexity of the software eventually overwhelmed its limited configuration. At one time in Star's development, it took more than half an hour to reboot the system.\n\nThe next Star workstation hardware was known as a Dandelion (often shortened to \"Dlion\"). It was based on the [[AMD Am2900]] [[bitslice microprocessor technology]]. An enhanced version of the Dandelion, with more microcode space, was dubbed the \u201cDandetiger.\u201d\n\nThe base Dandelion system had 384&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] [[Computer storage|memory]] (expandable to 1.5&nbsp;MB), a 10&nbsp;MB, 29&nbsp;MB or 40&nbsp;MB 8\" hard drive, an 8\" [[floppy drive]], mouse and an [[Ethernet]] connection. The performance of this machine, which sold for $20,000, was about 850 in the [[Dhrystone]] benchmark \u2014 comparable to that of a [[VAX-11]]/750, which cost five times more. The {{convert|17|in|cm}} [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) display (black and white, 1024\u00d7809 pixels with 38.7&nbsp;Hz refresh<ref>{{Cite journal\n | publication-date = 1985\u20131987\n | title = Xerox 8010/40 Document creation system brochure\n | publication-place =Uxbridge, Middlesex\n | publisher = Rank Xerox\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>) was large by the time's standards. It was meant to be able to display two 8.5\u00d711 in pages side by side in true size. An interesting feature of the display was that the overscan area (borders) could be programmed with a 16\u00d716 pattern. This was used to extend the root window pattern to all the edges of the monitor, a feature that is unavailable even today on most video cards.\n\nThe next design, the Dorado, used an [[emitter coupled logic]] (ECL) processor. It was four times faster than Dandelion on standard benchmarks, and thus competitive with the fastest super minicomputers of the day. It was used for research but was a rack-mounted CPU that was never intended to be an office product.<ref name=\"dorado\">{{Cite journal|author=Pier|first=Kenneth A.|date=|year=1983|title=A retrospective on the Dorado, a high-performance personal computer|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/parc/techReports/ISL-83-1_A_Retrospective_on_the_Dorado_A_High-Performance_Personal_Computer.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 10th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture|volume=|pages=|accessdate=January 26, 2019|via=}}</ref>\nA [[Router (computing)|network router]] called Dicentra was also based on this design.\n\n==Marketing and commercial reception==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}\n[[File:Rank Xerox 8010+40 brochure front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rank Xerox]] brochure for 8010/40 system]]\nThe Xerox Star was not originally meant to be a stand-alone computer, but to be part of an integrated Xerox \"personal office system\" that also connected to other workstations and network services via Ethernet. Although a single unit sold for $16,000, a typical office would need to buy at least 2 or 3 machines along with a file server and a name server/print server. Spending $50,000 to $100,000 for a complete installation was not an easy sell, when a secretary's annual salary was about $12,000 and a [[Commodore VIC-20]] cost around $300.\n\nLater incarnations of the Star would allow users to buy one unit with a [[laser printer]], but even so, only about 25,000 units were sold, leading many to consider the Xerox Star a commercial failure.\n\nThe workstation was originally designed to run the Star software for performing office tasks, but it was also sold with different software for other markets. These other configurations included a workstation for [[Interlisp]] or Smalltalk, and a server.\n\nSome have said that the Star was ahead of its time, that few outside of a small circle of developers really understood the potential of the system,<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Norman\n | first = Donald A.\n | authorlink = Donald Norman\n | title = The Invisible Computer\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | year = 1999\n | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/invisiblecompute00norm_0/page/316 316]\n | isbn = 978-0-262-64041-1\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/invisiblecompute00norm_0/page/316\n }}</ref> considering that [[IBM]] introduced their 8088-based [[IBM PC]] running the comparatively primitive [[PC DOS]] the same year that the Star was brought to market. However, comparison with the IBM PC may be irrelevant: well before it was introduced, buyers in the Word Processing industry were aware of the 8086-based [[IBM Displaywriter]],<ref>IBM's launch presentation (at 103 Wigmore St London in September 1980) claimed the Displaywriter used ''three'' 8086 chips, though 1x8086 + 2x8088 seems more credible.{{Citation needed|reason=A verifiable source is needed for the statement that the Displaywriter used the 8086|date=April 2016}}</ref> the full-page portrait black-on-white Xerox 860 page display system and the 120 page-per-minute [[Xerox 9700]] laser printer. Furthermore, the design principles of Smalltalk and modeless working had been extensively discussed in the August 1981 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] magazine,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://users.ipa.net/~dwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html \n |title=Design Principles Behind Smalltalk \n |author=Dan Ingalls \n |date=August 1981 \n |work=Byte magazine \n |publisher=McGraw-Hill \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190743/http://users.ipa.net/~dwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html \n |archivedate=September 27, 2007 \n}}</ref> so [[Xerox PARC]]'s standing and the potential of the Star can scarcely have been lost on its target (office systems) market, who would never have expected IBM to position a mass-market PC to threaten far more profitable dedicated WP systems. Unfortunately, the influential niche market of pioneering players in [[electronic publishing]] such as [[Longman]] were already aligning their production processes towards generic [[markup language]]s such as [[SGML]] (forerunner of HTML and XML) whereby authors using inexpensive offline systems could describe document structure, making their manuscripts ready for transfer to [[computer to film]] systems that offered far higher resolution than the then maximum of 360 dpi laser printing technologies.\n\nAnother possible reason given for the lack of success of the Star was Xerox's corporate structure. A longtime [[copier]] company, Xerox played to their strengths. They already had one significant failure in making their acquisition of [[Scientific Data Systems]] pay off. It is said that there were internal jealousies between the old line copier systems divisions that were responsible for bulk of Xerox's revenues and the new upstart division. Their marketing efforts were seen by some as half-hearted or unfocused. Furthermore, the most technically savvy sales representatives that might have sold office automation equipment were paid large commissions on leases of laser printer equipment costing up to a half-million dollars. No commission structure for ''decentralized'' systems could compete. The multi-lingual technical documentation market was also a major opportunity, but this needed cross-border collaboration for which few sales organisations were ready at the time.\n\nEven within Xerox Corporation, in the mid-1980s, there was little understanding of the system. Few corporate executives ever saw or used the system, and the sales teams, if they requested a ''computer'' to assist with their planning, would instead receive older, [[CP/M]]-based Xerox 820 or 820-II systems. There was no effort to seed the 8010/8012 Star systems within Xerox Corporation.\n\nProbably most significantly, strategic planners at the Xerox Systems Group (XSG) felt that they could not compete against other workstation makers such as [[Apollo Computer]] or [[Symbolics]]. The Xerox name alone was considered their greatest asset, but it did not produce customers.\n\nFinally, by today's standards, the system would be considered very slow, due partly to the limited hardware of the time, and partly to a poorly implemented file system; saving a large file could take minutes. Crashes could be followed by an hours-long process called ''file scavenging'', signaled by the appearance of the diagnostic code ''7511'' in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nIn the end, the Star's weak commercial reception probably came down to price, performance in demonstrations, and weakness of sales channels. Even then [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer's]] [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], inspired by the Star and introduced 2 years later, was a market failure, for many of the same reasons as the Star. To credit Xerox, they did try many things to try to improve sales. The next release of Star was on a different, more efficient hardware platform, [[Xerox Daybreak|Daybreak]], using a new, faster processor, and accompanied by significant rewriting of the Star software, renamed ViewPoint, to improve performance. The new system, dubbed the ''Xerox 6085 PCS'', was released in 1985. The new hardware provided 1&nbsp;MB to 4&nbsp;MB of memory, a 10&nbsp;MB to 80&nbsp;MB hard disk, a 15\" or 19\" display, a 5.25\" floppy drive, a mouse, Ethernet connection and a price of a little over $6,000.\n\nThe Xerox 6085 could be sold along with an attached laser printer as a standalone system. Also offered was a PC compatibility mode via an 80186-based expansion board. Users could transfer files between the ViewPoint system and PC-based software, albeit with some difficulty because the file formats were incompatible with any on the PC. But even with a significantly lower price, it was still a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]] in the world of lower cost $2,000 personal computers.\n\nIn 1989, Viewpoint 2.0 introduced many new applications related to [[desktop publishing]]. Eventually, Xerox jettisoned the integrated hardware/software workstation offered by Viewpoint and offered a software-only product called ''[[GlobalView]]'', providing the Star interface and technology on an IBM PC compatible platform. The initial release required installing a Mesa CPU add-on board. The final release of GlobalView 2.1 ran as an emulator on Sun Solaris, Microsoft [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]], or [[Windows 98]], IBM [[OS/2]] and was released in 1996.\n\nIn the end, Xerox PARC, which prided itself upon building hardware 10 years ahead of its time and equipping each researcher with the hardware so they could get started on the software, enabled Xerox to bring the product to market 5 years too early, all throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. The custom-hardware platform was always too expensive for the mission for which Star/Viewpoint was intended. Apple, having copied the Xerox Star in the early 1980s with Lisa, struggled and had the same poor results. Apple's second, cost-reduced effort, the Macintosh, barely succeeded (by ditching the virtual memory, implementing it in software, and using commodity microprocessors) - and was not their most profitable product in the late 1980s. Apple also struggled to make profits on office system software in the same time period. [[L Peter Deutsch]], one of the pioneers of the [[PostScript#The language|Postscript language]], finally found a way to achieve Xerox-Star-like efficiency using [[just-in-time compilation]] in the early 1990s for bitmap operations, making the last bit of Xerox-Star custom hardware, the [[BitBLT]], obsolete by 1990.\n\n==Legacy==\nEven though the Star product failed in the market, it raised expectations and laid important groundwork for later computers. Many of the innovations behind the Star, such as WYSIWYG editing, [[Ethernet]], and network services such as directory, print, file, and internetwork routing have become commonplace in computers of today.\n\nMembers of the [[Apple Lisa]] engineering team saw Star at its introduction at the [[National Computer Conference]] (NCC '81) and returned to Cupertino where they converted their desktop manager to an icon-based interface modeled on the Star.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Interview with Wayne Rosing, Bruce Daniels, and Larry Tesler |publisher=Byte |url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisainterview|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> Among the developers of Xerox's [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy]] WYSIWYG editor, [[Larry Tesler]] left Xerox to join Apple in 1980 where he also developed the [[MacApp|MacApp framework]].\n\n[[Charles Simonyi]] left Xerox to join [[Microsoft]] in 1981 where he developed first WYSIWYG version of [[Microsoft_Word|Microsoft Word (3.0)]] and beyond,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=James |author2=Erickson, Jim |title=Hard Drive |year=1992 |isbn=0-471-56886-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/harddrivebillgat00wall_0/page/219 219\u2013220] |quote=I lost faith in Xerox's ability to do anything |publisher=Wiley |location=New York u.a. |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/harddrivebillgat00wall_0/page/219 }}</ref> and several other defectors from PARC followed Simonyi to Microsoft in 1983.<ref>''Hard Drive'',  pp. 254-255</ref>\n\nStar, Viewpoint and [[GlobalView]] were the first commercial computing environments to offer support for most [[natural language]]s, including full-featured word processing, leading to their adoption by the [[Voice of America]], other United States foreign affairs agencies, and several multinational corporations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weird Processing: The Collision of Computers and Cultures at the Voice of America 2007 |publisher=Chris Kern's Eponymous Web Site |url=http://www.chriskern.net/history/computersAndCulturesAtVoa.html |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>\n\n<!--The Alto and Star both influenced later developments. Alto's effects began earlier, in smaller numbers, with less evolved systems. Star's effects began later, in larger numbers, with more evolved systems.-->\nThe list of products that were inspired or influenced by the user interface of the Star, and to a lesser extent the Alto, include the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]], [[Graphics Environment Manager]] (GEM) from [[Digital Research]] (the [[CP/M]] company), VisiCorp's [[Visi On]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Atari ST]], [[BTRON]] from [[TRON Project]], [[Commodore International|Commodore's]] [[Amiga]], Elixir Desktop, [[Metaphor Computer Systems]], [[Interleaf]], IBM [[OS/2]], [[OPEN LOOK]] (co-developed by Xerox), [[SunView]], [[KDE]], [[Ventura Publisher]] and [[NEXTSTEP]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Xerox Star Research|publisher=John Redant|url=http://xeroxstar.tripod.com |accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> [[Adobe Systems]] [[PostScript]] was based on [[Interpress]]. [[Ethernet]] was further refined by [[3Com]], and has become a [[de facto]] standard networking protocol.\n\nSome people, like Dominic Connor, feel that Apple, Microsoft, and others plagiarized the [[GUI]] and other innovations from the Xerox Star, and believe that Xerox didn't properly protect its intellectual property. The truth is more complex, perhaps. Many patent disclosures were submitted for the innovations in the Star. However, at the time, the 1975 Xerox Consent Decree, a [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) [[antitrust]] action, placed restrictions on what the firm was able to [[patent]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1975 Xerox Consent Decree: Ancient Artifacts and Current Tensions|publisher=Willard K.

Finally, patents on software, particularly those relating to user interfaces, were then an untested legal area.\n\nXerox did go to trial to protect the Star user interface. In 1989, after [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|Apple sued Microsoft]] for copyright infringement of its Macintosh user interface in Windows, Xerox filed a similar [[lawsuit]] against Apple. However, this suit was thrown out on procedural grounds, not substantive, because a three-year [[statute of limitations]] had passed. In 1994, Apple lost its suit against Microsoft, not only the issues originally contested, but all claims to the user interface.<ref>{{cite news |title=Copyright: Apple vs. Microsoft |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://www.me.utexas.edu/~me179/topics/copyright/case2.html|accessdate=2007-02-08}} An index of NYT articles concerning both the Apple/Microsoft suit and the Xerox/Apple suit</ref>\n\nOn January 15, 2019, a work-in-progress Xerox Star emulator created by [[Living Computers: Museum + Labs|LCM+L]] known as Darkstar was released for Windows and Linux.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://engblg.livingcomputers.org/index.php/2019/01/19/introducing-darkstar-a-xerox-star-emulator/|title=Introducing Darkstar: A Xerox Star Emulator|last=Dersch|first=John|date=January 19, 2019|publisher=[[Living Computers: Museum + Labs]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120000030/https://engblg.livingcomputers.org/index.php/2019/01/19/introducing-darkstar-a-xerox-star-emulator//|archive-date=January 20, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lisp machine]]\n*[[Pilot (operating system)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taouu/html/ch02s05.html The first GUIs - Chapter 2.

When the resulting Xerox Star system was announced in 1981,<ref name=\"parchis\"/> the cost was about $75,000 (${{Inflation|US|75000|1981|r=-3|fmt=c}} in today's dollars) for a basic system, and $16,000 (${{Inflation|US|16000|1981|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) for each added workstation.\n\n===The Xerox Star development process===\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}\nThe Star was developed at Xerox's Systems Development Department (SDD) in [[El Segundo, California]], which had been established in 1977 {{citation needed|date=February 2019}} under the direction of Don Massaro. A section of SDD, ''SDD North'', was located in [[Palo Alto]], California, and included some people borrowed from PARC. SDD's mission was to design the \"[[Office of the future]]\", a new system that would incorporate the best features of the Alto, was easy to use, and could automate many office tasks.\n\nThe development team was headed by [[David Liddle]], and would eventually grow to more than 200 developers. A good part of the first year was taken up by meetings and planning, the result of which was an extensive and detailed functional specification, internally termed the \"Red Book\". This became the bible for all development tasks. It defined the interface and enforced consistency in all modules and tasks. All changes to the functional specification had to be approved by a review team which maintained standards rigorously.\n\nOne group in Palo Alto worked on the underlying [[operating system]] interface to the hardware and programming tools. Teams in El Segundo and Palo Alto collaborated on developing the user interface and user applications.\n\nThe staff relied heavily on the technologies they were working on, file sharing, print servers and e-mail. They were even connected to the [[Internet]], then named [[Arpanet]], which helped them communicate between El Segundo and Palo Alto.\n\nThe Star was implemented in the programming language [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa]], a direct precursor to [[Modula-2]] and [[Modula-3]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.modulaware.com/mdlt52.htm\n | title = A Brief History of Modula and Lilith\n | author = Niklaus Wirth\n | date=January 1995\n | work = The ModulaTor Oberon-2 and Modula-2 Technical Publication\n | publisher = modulaware.com\n}}</ref> Mesa was not [[object-oriented]], but tools and programming techniques were developed which allowed pseudo object-oriented design and programming. Mesa required creating two files for every module. A definition module specified data structures and procedures for each object, and one or more implementation modules contained the code for the procedures.\n\nThe Star team used a sophisticated [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), named internally ''Tajo'' and externally ''[[Xerox Development Environment]]'' (XDE). Tajo had many similarities with the [[Smalltalk]]-80 environment, but it had many added tools. For example, the [[version control]] system DF, which required programmers to check out modules before they could be changed. Any change in a module which would force changes in dependent modules were closely tracked and documented. Changes to lower level modules required various levels of approval.\n\nThe software development process was intense. It involved much [[prototyping]] and user testing. The [[software engineering|software engineers]] had to develop new network [[communications protocol]]s and data-encoding schemes when those used in PARC's research environment proved inadequate.\n\nInitially, all development was done on Alto workstations. These were not well suited to the extreme burdens placed by the software. Even the processor intended for the product proved inadequate and involved a last minute hardware redesign. Many software redesigns, rewrites, and late additions had to be made, variously based on results from user testing, and marketing and systems considerations.\n\nA [[Japanese language]] version of the system was produced in conjunction with [[Fuji Xerox]], code named ''J-Star'', and full support for international customers.\n\nIn the end, many features from the Star Functional Specification were not implemented. The product had to get to market, and the last several months before release focused on reliability and performance.\n\n==System features==\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:Xerox 8010 compound document.jpg|thumb|right|Compound document and desktop of 8010/40 system]]\n[[File:Evolution of the document icon shape.jpg|thumb|Evolution of the used document icon shape]]\n\nThe key philosophy of the user interface was to mimic the office paradigm as much as possible in order to make it intuitive for users. The concept of ''what you see is what you get'' ([[WYSIWYG]]) was considered paramount. Text would be displayed as black on a white background, just like paper, and the printer would replicate the screen using [[Interpress]], a page description language developed at PARC.\n\nOne of the main designers of the Star, Dr. [[David Canfield Smith]], invented the concept of [[computer icon]]s and the desktop metaphor, in which the user would see a desktop that contained documents and folders, with different icons representing different types of documents.<ref name=\"MIT\">{{cite paper |last= Lieberman |first= Henry |title= A Creative Programming Environment, Remixed |citeseerx=10.1.1.125.4685 |publisher= MIT Media Lab |location= Cambridge}}</ref><ref name=\"Nader\">Salha, Nader.

[https://books.google.com/books/about/Pygmalion.html?id=mihHAAAAIAAJ \"Pygmalion: A Creative Programming Environment\"], 1975.</ref> Clicking any icon would open a window. Users would not start programs first (e.g., a text editor, graphics program or spreadsheet software), they would simply open the file and the appropriate application would appear.\n\nThe Star user interface was based on the concept of objects. For example, a word processing document would hold page objects, paragraph objects, sentence objects, word objects, and character objects. The user could select objects by clicking on them with the mouse, and press dedicated special keys on the keyboard to invoke standard object functions (open, delete, copy, move) in a uniform way. There was also a \"Show Properties\" key used to display settings, called property sheets, for the particular object (e.g., font size for a character object). These general conventions greatly simplified the menu structure of all the programs.\n\nObject integration was designed into the system from the start. For example, a chart object created in the graphing module could be inserted into any type of document. This type of ability eventually became available as part of the [[operating system]] on the [[Apple Lisa]] and was featured in Mac OS [[System 7]] as [[Publish and Subscribe (Mac OS)|Publish and Subscribe]]. It became available on [[Microsoft Windows]] with the introduction of [[Object Linking and Embedding]] (OLE) in 1990. This approach was also later used on the [[OpenDoc]] software platform in the mid-to-late 1990s, and in the [[AppleWorks]] (originally ClarisWorks) package available for the Apple Mac (1991) and Microsoft Windows (1993).\n\n===Hardware===\nInitially, the Star software was to run on a new series of virtual-memory processors, described in a PARC technical report called, \"''Wildflower: An Architecture for a Personal Computer''\", by Butler Lampson. The machines had names that always began with the letter ''D''. They were all [[microcode|microprogrammed]] processors; for the Star software, the microcode implemented an instruction set designed for Mesa.\n\nThe first of these machines was the Dolphin, built with [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL) technology, including [[74181|74S181]] ALUs. The complexity of the software eventually overwhelmed its limited configuration. At one time in Star's development, it took more than half an hour to reboot the system.\n\nThe next Star workstation hardware was known as a Dandelion (often shortened to \"Dlion\"). It was based on the [[AMD Am2900]] [[bitslice microprocessor technology]]. An enhanced version of the Dandelion, with more microcode space, was dubbed the \u201cDandetiger.\u201d\n\nThe base Dandelion system had 384&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] [[Computer storage|memory]] (expandable to 1.5&nbsp;MB), a 10&nbsp;MB, 29&nbsp;MB or 40&nbsp;MB 8\" hard drive, an 8\" [[floppy drive]], mouse and an [[Ethernet]] connection. The performance of this machine, which sold for $20,000, was about 850 in the [[Dhrystone]] benchmark \u2014 comparable to that of a [[VAX-11]]/750, which cost five times more. The {{convert|17|in|cm}} [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) display (black and white, 1024\u00d7809 pixels with 38.7&nbsp;Hz refresh<ref>{{Cite journal\n | publication-date = 1985\u20131987\n | title = Xerox 8010/40 Document creation system brochure\n | publication-place =Uxbridge, Middlesex\n | publisher = Rank Xerox\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>) was large by the time's standards. It was meant to be able to display two 8.5\u00d711 in pages side by side in true size. An interesting feature of the display was that the overscan area (borders) could be programmed with a 16\u00d716 pattern. This was used to extend the root window pattern to all the edges of the monitor, a feature that is unavailable even today on most video cards.\n\nThe next design, the Dorado, used an [[emitter coupled logic]] (ECL) processor. It was four times faster than Dandelion on standard benchmarks, and thus competitive with the fastest super minicomputers of the day.

Although a single unit sold for $16,000, a typical office would need to buy at least 2 or 3 machines along with a file server and a name server/print server. Spending $50,000 to $100,000 for a complete installation was not an easy sell, when a secretary's annual salary was about $12,000 and a [[Commodore VIC-20]] cost around $300.\n\nLater incarnations of the Star would allow users to buy one unit with a [[laser printer]], but even so, only about 25,000 units were sold, leading many to consider the Xerox Star a commercial failure.\n\nThe workstation was originally designed to run the Star software for performing office tasks, but it was also sold with different software for other markets. These other configurations included a workstation for [[Interlisp]] or Smalltalk, and a server.\n\nSome have said that the Star was ahead of its time, that few outside of a small circle of developers really understood the potential of the system,<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Norman\n | first = Donald A.\n | authorlink = Donald Norman\n | title = The Invisible Computer\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | year = 1999\n | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/invisiblecompute00norm_0/page/316 316]\n | isbn = 978-0-262-64041-1\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/invisiblecompute00norm_0/page/316\n }}</ref> considering that [[IBM]] introduced their 8088-based [[IBM PC]] running the comparatively primitive [[PC DOS]] the same year that the Star was brought to market. However, comparison with the IBM PC may be irrelevant: well before it was introduced, buyers in the Word Processing industry were aware of the 8086-based [[IBM Displaywriter]],<ref>IBM's launch presentation (at 103 Wigmore St London in September 1980) claimed the Displaywriter used ''three'' 8086 chips, though 1x8086 + 2x8088 seems more credible.{{Citation needed|reason=A verifiable source is needed for the statement that the Displaywriter used the 8086|date=April 2016}}</ref> the full-page portrait black-on-white Xerox 860 page display system and the 120 page-per-minute [[Xerox 9700]] laser printer. Furthermore, the design principles of Smalltalk and modeless working had been extensively discussed in the August 1981 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] magazine,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://users.ipa.net/~dwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html \n |title=Design Principles Behind Smalltalk \n |author=Dan Ingalls \n |date=August 1981 \n |work=Byte magazine \n |publisher=McGraw-Hill \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190743/http://users.ipa.net/~dwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html \n |archivedate=September 27, 2007 \n}}</ref> so [[Xerox PARC]]'s standing and the potential of the Star can scarcely have been lost on its target (office systems) market, who would never have expected IBM to position a mass-market PC to threaten far more profitable dedicated WP systems. Unfortunately, the influential niche market of pioneering players in [[electronic publishing]] such as [[Longman]] were already aligning their production processes towards generic [[markup language]]s such as [[SGML]] (forerunner of HTML and XML) whereby authors using inexpensive offline systems could describe document structure, making their manuscripts ready for transfer to [[computer to film]] systems that offered far higher resolution than the then maximum of 360 dpi laser printing technologies.\n\nAnother possible reason given for the lack of success of the Star was Xerox's corporate structure. A longtime [[copier]] company, Xerox played to their strengths. They already had one significant failure in making their acquisition of [[Scientific Data Systems]] pay off. It is said that there were internal jealousies between the old line copier systems divisions that were responsible for bulk of Xerox's revenues and the new upstart division. Their marketing efforts were seen by some as half-hearted or unfocused. Furthermore, the most technically savvy sales representatives that might have sold office automation equipment were paid large commissions on leases of laser printer equipment costing up to a half-million dollars. No commission structure for ''decentralized'' systems could compete. The multi-lingual technical documentation market was also a major opportunity, but this needed cross-border collaboration for which few sales organisations were ready at the time.\n\nEven within Xerox Corporation, in the mid-1980s, there was little understanding of the system. Few corporate executives ever saw or used the system, and the sales teams, if they requested a ''computer'' to assist with their planning, would instead receive older, [[CP/M]]-based Xerox 820 or 820-II systems. There was no effort to seed the 8010/8012 Star systems within Xerox Corporation.\n\nProbably most significantly, strategic planners at the Xerox Systems Group (XSG) felt that they could not compete against other workstation makers such as [[Apollo Computer]] or [[Symbolics]]. The Xerox name alone was considered their greatest asset, but it did not produce customers.\n\nFinally, by today's standards, the system would be considered very slow, due partly to the limited hardware of the time, and partly to a poorly implemented file system; saving a large file could take minutes. Crashes could be followed by an hours-long process called ''file scavenging'', signaled by the appearance of the diagnostic code ''7511'' in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nIn the end, the Star's weak commercial reception probably came down to price, performance in demonstrations, and weakness of sales channels. Even then [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer's]] [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], inspired by the Star and introduced 2 years later, was a market failure, for many of the same reasons as the Star. To credit Xerox, they did try many things to try to improve sales. The next release of Star was on a different, more efficient hardware platform, [[Xerox Daybreak|Daybreak]], using a new, faster processor, and accompanied by significant rewriting of the Star software, renamed ViewPoint, to improve performance. The new system, dubbed the ''Xerox 6085 PCS'', was released in 1985. The new hardware provided 1&nbsp;MB to 4&nbsp;MB of memory, a 10&nbsp;MB to 80&nbsp;MB hard disk, a 15\" or 19\" display, a 5.25\" floppy drive, a mouse, Ethernet connection and a price of a little over $6,000.\n\nThe Xerox 6085 could be sold along with an attached laser printer as a standalone system. Also offered was a PC compatibility mode via an 80186-based expansion board. Users could transfer files between the ViewPoint system and PC-based software, albeit with some difficulty because the file formats were incompatible with any on the PC. But even with a significantly lower price, it was still a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls Royce]] in the world of lower cost $2,000 personal computers.\n\nIn 1989, Viewpoint 2.0 introduced many new applications related to [[desktop publishing]]. Eventually, Xerox jettisoned the integrated hardware/software workstation offered by Viewpoint and offered a software-only product called ''[[GlobalView]]'', providing the Star interface and technology on an IBM PC compatible platform. The initial release required installing a Mesa CPU add-on board. The final release of GlobalView 2.1 ran as an emulator on Sun Solaris, Microsoft [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]], or [[Windows 98]], IBM [[OS/2]] and was released in 1996.\n\nIn the end, Xerox PARC, which prided itself upon building hardware 10 years ahead of its time and equipping each researcher with the hardware so they could get started on the software, enabled Xerox to bring the product to market 5 years too early, all throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. The custom-hardware platform was always too expensive for the mission for which Star/Viewpoint was intended. Apple, having copied the Xerox Star in the early 1980s with Lisa, struggled and had the same poor results. Apple's second, cost-reduced effort, the Macintosh, barely succeeded (by ditching the virtual memory, implementing it in software, and using commodity microprocessors) - and was not their most profitable product in the late 1980s. Apple also struggled to make profits on office system software in the same time period. [[L Peter Deutsch]], one of the pioneers of the [[PostScript#The language|Postscript language]], finally found a way to achieve Xerox-Star-like efficiency using [[just-in-time compilation]] in the early 1990s for bitmap operations, making the last bit of Xerox-Star custom hardware, the [[BitBLT]], obsolete by 1990.\n\n==Legacy==\nEven though the Star product failed in the market, it raised expectations and laid important groundwork for later computers. Many of the innovations behind the Star, such as WYSIWYG editing, [[Ethernet]], and network services such as directory, print, file, and internetwork routing have become commonplace in computers of today.\n\nMembers of the [[Apple Lisa]] engineering team saw Star at its introduction at the [[National Computer Conference]] (NCC '81) and returned to Cupertino where they converted their desktop manager to an icon-based interface modeled on the Star.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Interview with Wayne Rosing, Bruce Daniels, and Larry Tesler |publisher=Byte |url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/lisainterview|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> Among the developers of Xerox's [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy]] WYSIWYG editor, [[Larry Tesler]] left Xerox to join Apple in 1980 where he also developed the [[MacApp|MacApp framework]].\n\n[[Charles Simonyi]] left Xerox to join [[Microsoft]] in 1981 where he developed first WYSIWYG version of Microsoft Word (3.0) and beyond,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=James |author2=Erickson, Jim |title=Hard Drive |year=1992 |isbn=0-471-56886-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/harddrivebillgat00wall_0/page/219 219\u2013220] |quote=I lost faith in Xerox's ability to do anything |publisher=Wiley |location=New York u.a. |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/harddrivebillgat00wall_0/page/219 }}</ref> and several other defectors from PARC followed Simonyi to Microsoft in 1983.<ref>''Hard Drive'',  pp. 254-255</ref>\n\nStar, Viewpoint and [[GlobalView]] were the first commercial computing environments to offer support for most [[natural language]]s, including full-featured word processing, leading to their adoption by the [[Voice of America]], other United States foreign affairs agencies, and several multinational corporations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weird Processing: The Collision of Computers and Cultures at the Voice of America 2007 |publisher=Chris Kern's Eponymous Web Site |url=http://www.chriskern.net/history/computersAndCulturesAtVoa.html |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref>\n\n<!--The Alto and Star both influenced later developments. Alto's effects began earlier, in smaller numbers, with less evolved systems. Star's effects began later, in larger numbers, with more evolved systems.-->\nThe list of products that were inspired or influenced by the user interface of the Star, and to a lesser extent the Alto, include the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]], [[Graphics Environment Manager]] (GEM) from [[Digital Research]] (the [[CP/M]] company), VisiCorp's [[Visi On]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Atari ST]], [[BTRON]] from [[TRON Project]], [[Commodore International|Commodore's]] [[Amiga]], Elixir Desktop, [[Metaphor Computer Systems]], [[Interleaf]], IBM [[OS/2]], [[OPEN LOOK]] (co-developed by Xerox), [[SunView]], [[KDE]], [[Ventura Publisher]] and [[NEXTSTEP]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Xerox Star Research|publisher=John Redant|url=http://xeroxstar.tripod.com |accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref> [[Adobe Systems]] [[PostScript]] was based on [[Interpress]]. [[Ethernet]] was further refined by [[3Com]], and has become a [[de facto]] standard networking protocol.\n\nSome people, like Dominic Connor, feel that Apple, Microsoft, and others plagiarized the [[GUI]] and other innovations from the Xerox Star, and believe that Xerox didn't properly protect its intellectual property. The truth is more complex, perhaps. Many patent disclosures were submitted for the innovations in the Star. However, at the time, the 1975 Xerox Consent Decree, a [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) [[antitrust]] action, placed restrictions on what the firm was able to [[patent]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1975 Xerox Consent Decree: Ancient Artifacts and Current Tensions|publisher=Willard K. Tom|url=https://www.abanet.org/antitrust/at-journal/pdf/abstracts/v68-I3/v68-I3-abstract-06.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> Also, when the Star disclosures were being prepared, the Xerox patent attorneys were busy with several other new technologies such as laser printing. Finally, patents on software, particularly those relating to user interfaces, were then an untested legal area.\n\nXerox did go to trial to protect the Star user interface. In 1989, after [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|Apple sued Microsoft]] for copyright infringement of its Macintosh user interface in Windows, Xerox filed a similar [[lawsuit]] against Apple. However, this suit was thrown out on procedural grounds, not substantive, because a three-year [[statute of limitations]] had passed. In 1994, Apple lost its suit against Microsoft, not only the issues originally contested, but all claims to the user interface.<ref>{{cite news |title=Copyright: Apple vs. Microsoft |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://www.me.utexas.edu/~me179/topics/copyright/case2.html|accessdate=2007-02-08}} An index of NYT articles concerning both the Apple/Microsoft suit and the Xerox/Apple suit</ref>\n\nOn January 15, 2019, a work-in-progress Xerox Star emulator created by [[Living Computers: Museum + Labs|LCM+L]] known as Darkstar was released for Windows and Linux.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://engblg.livingcomputers.org/index.php/2019/01/19/introducing-darkstar-a-xerox-star-emulator/|title=Introducing Darkstar: A Xerox Star Emulator|last=Dersch|first=John|date=January 19, 2019|publisher=[[Living Computers: Museum + Labs]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120000030/https://engblg.livingcomputers.org/index.php/2019/01/19/introducing-darkstar-a-xerox-star-emulator//|archive-date=January 20, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lisp machine]]\n*[[Pilot (operating system)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taouu/html/ch02s05.html The first GUIs - Chapter 2.

The intangibles tax was levied on individuals\u2019 holdings of stock and bonds. The revenue was collected in the county of origin and was distributed to libraries based on need.\nIn 1983, the Ohio General Assembly repealed the intangibles tax and replaced it with the Library and Local Government Support Fund or LLGSF. An amount of the personal income tax equaling 6.3% of Ohio\u2019s personal income tax receipts were earmarked for the LLGSF. This funding was divided using an equalization formula so that underserved areas would receive a guaranteed share.\nIn 1993, the General Assembly passed legislation reducing the LLGSF from 6.3% to 5.7% of personal income tax. It remained at that level until the 2002-2003 biennium budget called for the funding to be frozen at the same level as July 2000 through June 2001. This was the beginning of a funding freeze which lasted through December 2007.\nBeginning with January 2008 distributions, a new funding source was developed.
