It is generally considered to represent a classic clash between two schools of moral thought, [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontological ethics]]. The general form of the problem is this:\n\n<blockquote>There is a runaway [[Tram|trolley]] barreling down the [[Track (rail transport)|railway tracks]]. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: \n\n# Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\n# Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n\nWhich is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Philippa Foot]] introduced this modern form of the problem in 1967.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\">Philippa Foot, \"[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]\" in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)</ref> [[Judith Thomson]],<ref>Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem]'', 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)</ref><ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\">Judith Jarvis Thomson, \"[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/thomsonTROLLEY.pdf The Trolley Problem]\", 94 ''Yale Law Journal'' 1395\u20131415 (1985)</ref> [[Frances Kamm]],<ref>Francis Myrna Kamm, \"Harming Some to Save Others\", 57 ''Philosophical Studies'' 227-60 (1989)</ref> and [[Peter Unger]] have also analysed the [[dilemma]] extensively.<ref>Peter Unger, ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996)</ref> \n\nEarlier forms of the problem predated Foot's publication. [[Frank Chapman Sharp]] included a version in a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1905.

The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\" />}}\n\nA [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all).<ref>Barcalow, Emmett, ''Moral Philosophy: Theories and Issues.'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2007. Print.</ref> An alternate viewpoint {{by whom|date=December 2019}} is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurability]] of human lives. Under some interpretations of [[duty|moral obligation]], simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.\n\n== Related problems ==\n[[File:The trolley problem.svg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Five variants of the trolley problem: the original Switch, the Fat Man, the Fat Villain, the Loop and the Man in the Yard]]\nThe trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between [[deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethical systems.<ref name=\":0\" />  The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the [[utility]] of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.\n\nThe initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:\n\n=== The fat man ===\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you \u2013 your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.<ref>Peter Singer, ''Ethics and Intuitions'' The Journal of Ethics (2005). http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf</ref> This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.\n\nOne clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone \u2013 harming the one is just a [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which [[Shelly Kagan]] considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book ''The Limits of Morality''.<ref>Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)</ref>\n\nA claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, the subject intends someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, they have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the [[doctrine of double effect]], which says that one may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.\n\nAnother distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area\u2014people who are \"uninvolved\"\u2014he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice one's own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be [[insufficient justification]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== The fat villain ===\nThe further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative. This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as [[ticking time bomb scenario]], which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.\n\n=== The loop variant ===\n\nThe claim that it is wrong to ''use'' the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:\n\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?}}\n\nThe only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track.  This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it.  The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.\n\nThe rejoining variant may not be fatal to the \"using a person as a means\" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article \"Another Trip on the Trolley\", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one.\n\n=== Transplant ===\nHere is an alternative case, due to [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]],<ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\" /> containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:\n\n{{quote|A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor. Do you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?}}\n\n=== The man in the yard ===\nUnger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:\n\n{{quote| As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You can divert its path by colliding another trolley into it, but if you do, both will be derailed and go down a hill, and into a yard where a man is sleeping in a hammock. He would be killed. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResponses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.\n\nUnger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics \u2013 in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly \"involved\". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not \"fair game\", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.\n\nUnger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.\n\n== Empirical research ==\n{{See also|Moral psychology|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\nIn 2001, [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Joshua D.|last2=Sommerville|first2=R.

To avoid the runaway train from entering the Union Pacific yards in Los Angeles, where it would not only cause damage, but a Metrolink passenger train was thought to be located, dispatchers ordered the shunting of the runaway cars to track 4, through an area with lower density housing of mostly lower income residents. The switch to track 4 was rated for 15mph transits, and dispatch knew the cars were moving significantly faster, thus likely causing a derailment.<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/Update_on_Union_Pacific_Rail_Accident_in_Commerce_California.aspx</ref> The train, carrying over 3800 tons of mostly lumber and building materials, then derailed into the residential neighborhood in Commerce, California, crashing through several houses on Davie Street.

It is generally considered to represent a classic clash between two schools of moral thought, [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontological ethics]]. The general form of the problem is this:\n\n<blockquote>There is a runaway [[Tram|trolley]] barreling down the [[Track (rail transport)|railway tracks]]. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: \n\n# Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.\n# Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n\nWhich is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Philippa Foot]] introduced this modern form of the problem in 1967.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\">Philippa Foot, \"[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]\" in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)</ref> [[Judith Thomson]],<ref>Judith Jarvis Thomson, ''[https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf Killing, Letting Die, and the Trolley Problem]'', 59 The Monist 204-17 (1976)</ref><ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\">Judith Jarvis Thomson, \"[http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/thomsonTROLLEY.pdf The Trolley Problem]\", 94 ''Yale Law Journal'' 1395\u20131415 (1985)</ref> [[Frances Kamm]],<ref>Francis Myrna Kamm, \"Harming Some to Save Others\", 57 ''Philosophical Studies'' 227-60 (1989)</ref> and [[Peter Unger]] have also analysed the [[dilemma]] extensively.<ref>Peter Unger, ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996)</ref> \n\nEarlier forms of the problem predated Foot's publication.

The real culprit being unknown, the judge sees himself as able to prevent the bloodshed only by framing some innocent person and having him executed. Beside this example is placed another in which a pilot whose airplane is about to crash is deciding whether to steer from a more to a less inhabited area. To make the parallel as close as possible it may rather be supposed that he is the driver of a runaway tram which he can only steer from one narrow track on to another; five men are working on one track and one man on the other; anyone on the track he enters is bound to be killed. In the case of the riots the mob have five hostages, so that in both examples the exchange is supposed to be one man's life for the lives of five.<ref name=\"Philippa Foot 1978\" />}}\n\nA [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all).<ref>Barcalow, Emmett, ''Moral Philosophy: Theories and Issues.'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2007. Print.</ref> An alternate viewpoint {{by whom|date=December 2019}} is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurability]] of human lives. Under some interpretations of [[duty|moral obligation]], simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.\n\n== Related problems ==\n[[File:The trolley problem.svg|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Five variants of the trolley problem: the original Switch, the Fat Man, the Fat Villain, the Loop and the Man in the Yard]]\nThe trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between [[deontological ethics|deontological]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] ethical systems.<ref name=\":0\" />  The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the [[utility]] of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.\n\nThe initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:\n\n=== The fat man ===\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you \u2013 your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives.<ref>Peter Singer, ''Ethics and Intuitions'' The Journal of Ethics (2005). http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/200510--.pdf</ref> This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.\n\nOne clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone \u2013 harming the one is just a [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which [[Shelly Kagan]] considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book ''The Limits of Morality''.<ref>Shelly Kagan, ''The Limits of Morality'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)</ref>\n\nA claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, the subject intends someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, they have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the [[doctrine of double effect]], which says that one may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.\n\nAnother distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area\u2014people who are \"uninvolved\"\u2014he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice one's own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be [[insufficient justification]].{{Clarify|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== The fat villain ===\nThe further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative. This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as [[ticking time bomb scenario]], which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.\n\n=== The loop variant ===\n\nThe claim that it is wrong to ''use'' the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:\n\n{{quote|As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people and you can divert it onto a secondary track. However, in this variant the secondary track later rejoins the main track, so diverting the trolley still leaves it on a track which leads to the five people. But, the person on the secondary track is a fat person who, when he is killed by the trolley, will stop it from continuing on to the five people. Should you flip the switch?}}\n\nThe only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track.  This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it.  The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.\n\nThe rejoining variant may not be fatal to the \"using a person as a means\" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article \"Another Trip on the Trolley\", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one.\n\n=== Transplant ===\nHere is an alternative case, due to [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]],<ref name=\"Judith Jarvis Thomson 1985\" /> containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:\n\n{{quote|A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor. Do you support the morality of the doctor to kill that tourist and provide his healthy organs to those five dying people and save their lives?}}\n\n=== The man in the yard ===\nUnger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:\n\n{{quote| As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You can divert its path by colliding another trolley into it, but if you do, both will be derailed and go down a hill, and into a yard where a man is sleeping in a hammock. He would be killed. Should you proceed?}}\n\nResponses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.\n\nUnger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics \u2013 in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly \"involved\". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not \"fair game\", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.\n\nUnger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.\n\n== Empirical research ==\n{{See also|Moral psychology|Dual process theory (moral psychology)}}\nIn 2001, [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Joshua D.|last2=Sommerville|first2=R.

To avoid the runaway train from entering the Union Pacific yards in Los Angeles, where it would not only cause damage, but a Metrolink passenger train was thought to be located, dispatchers ordered the shunting of the runaway cars to track 4, through an area with lower density housing of mostly lower income residents. The switch to track 4 was rated for 15mph transits, and dispatch knew the cars were moving significantly faster, thus likely causing a derailment.<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/Update_on_Union_Pacific_Rail_Accident_in_Commerce_California.aspx</ref> The train, carrying over 3800 tons of mostly lumber and building materials, then derailed into the residential neighborhood in Commerce, California, crashing through several houses on Davie Street.

She argues that the popular argument that [https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542626/why-self-driving-cars-must-be-programmed-to-kill/ the trolley problem can serve as a template for algorithmic morality] is based on fundamentally flawed premises that serve the most powerful with potentially dire consequences on the future of cities.\n\nIn 2017, in his book ''On Human Nature'', [[Roger Scruton]] criticises the usage of ethical dilemmas such as the trolley problem and their usage by philosophers such as [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Peter Singer]] as ways of illustrating their ethical views. Scruton writes, \"These \"dilemmas\" have the useful character of eliminating from the situation just about every morally relevant relationship and reducing the problem to one of arithmetic alone.\" Scruton believes that just because one would choose to change the track so that the train hits the one person instead of the five does not mean that they are necessarily a [[Consequentialist]]. As a way of showing the flaws in consequentialist responses to ethical problems, Scruton points out paradoxical elements of belief in utilitarianism and similar beliefs. He believes that [[Robert Nozick|Nozick's]] [[experience machine]] thought experiment definitively disproves [[hedonism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Scruton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |title=On Human Nature |publisher=Princeton |edition=1st |date=2017 |pages=79\u2013112 |isbn=978-0-691-18303-9}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2018 article published in ''Psychological Review'',<ref name=\"Kahane2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Kahane |first1=Guy |last2=Everett |first2=Jim A.

It parodies the [[Celebrity Jeopardy!|same-named special event]] on the television quiz show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' that features competition between notable individuals with all winnings going towards charitable organizations, and significant reductions to the game's level of difficulty. Fifteen sketches aired between December 1996 and February 2015: two sketches per season from [[Saturday Night Live (season 22)|1996]] to [[Saturday Night Live (season 27)|2002]]; and one each in [[Saturday Night Live (season 30)|2005]] and [[Saturday Night Live (season 34)|2009]], when Ferrell [[List of Saturday Night Live cast members who have hosted|returned to the show as host]].

Trebek welcomes the audience, and occasionally, apologizes for an offense or incident that occurred before the break. He then introduces the celebrity contestants, and reveals their scores, which are either $0, a negative score, or a very low positive score. Many times, the contestants refuse or fail to select an appropriate category and dollar value from the game board, grinding the game to a halt and often requiring Trebek to choose one himself. As the celebrities' growing ineptitude became apparent, the subject matter used for categories shifted from normal topics (such as \"Movies\" and \"Popular Music\") to more childish topics, categories with titles giving not-so-subtle hints as to the correct response without reading the clues (such as \"Famous [[Oprah]]s\"), and those requiring no responses whatsoever. Recurring ''Jeopardy!'' category \"Potent Potables\" appears in every sketch but is never selected, and when it finally is chosen, it results in an inadvertently offensive pre-recorded Video Daily Double involving [[Bill Cosby]].\n\nInstead of buzzing in with the correct questions, contestants either give horribly incorrect responses or say things that have nothing to do with the game, frustrating Trebek, who does nothing to hide his contempt for the celebrities' performance. Trebek's mood is also exacerbated by Connery's pranks and antics, which include making sexual jokes at Trebek's expense, deliberately [[dyslexia|misreading]] or [[vandalism|vandalizing]] the categories on the board to turn them into sexually suggestive phrases (such as \"The Pen is Mightier\", a category on literature, as \"The Penis Mightier\", which Connery suggests is a [[penis enlargement]] product), and implying that he has had sexual relations with the host's mother.\n\nTrebek eventually grows exasperated with his inability to conduct the show and cuts it short by moving to [[Jeopardy!#Final Jeopardy! Round|Final Jeopardy!]]. He either discards the scripted category in favor of a much easier task (such as having the celebrities write and respond to their own questions), or announces a childishly simple category. Even though it appears impossible for the celebrities to fail, they invariably do. Connery occasionally provides a correct response, yet uses his wager to transform the text into a rude phrase or drawing. Sometimes Connery appears to have sympathy for Trebek until the wager reveal, which happens to be a rude drawing at Trebek's expense; on an earlier sketch, this is also performed by [[John Travolta]], who in response to a clue asking the celebrities to name their favorite food, responds with \"[[miso]]\", an actual soup, yet when Trebek asks for the wager, reveals it to be \"horny\", which is read as \"me so horny\".\n\nTrebek is the beleaguered [[Double act|straight man]], and is generally the only person on stage interested in the game. The contestants, who are either unaware of what the game is or uninterested in playing, will ramble incoherently, deliver irrelevant monologues, or openly antagonize the host. Whenever a contestant takes the game seriously, they prove utterly incapable of supplying the correct question. No contestant ever offers a correct response; however, two come close: [[Phil Donahue]] and [[Tony Bennett]], who in their respective sketches, offer descriptions for the holiday of Christmas and ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''. When Reynolds, who had initially been the celebrity who appeared on each episode, makes his return appearances, he misreads categories in the same manner as Connery and insists that he be addressed as \"Turd Ferguson\" because he finds that name funny.\n\nAt the end of almost every sketch, all three celebrities have scores in the negative thousands of dollars, and in most cases, a humorous, often sexual, Final Jeopardy! punchline is delivered by Connery. In one of his sketches, Reynolds is declared an unquestioned winner, even though he wins simply because he has the least amount of negative money, rather than actually earning a victory.<ref>On the second Celebrity ''Jeopardy!'' sketch, from the ''SNL'' episode aired on May 10, 1997, Trebek declared Burt Reynolds the winner and announced that a $10,000 check would be awarded to Reynolds' charity, the Palm Beach Golf & Tennis Resort.  Please see [http://snltranscripts.jt.org/96/96sjeopardy.phtml this transcript]</ref> When Trebek ends the show, he either states that money will not be awarded to charity or announces his intention to resign or commit suicide.\n\n==Episodes==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!# \n!Original airdate \n!Episode \n!colspan=\"3\"|Celebrities impersonated\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 1\n| December 7, 1996\n|align=\"center\"| S22:E08\n| [[Sean Connery]]\n|rowspan=3| [[Burt Reynolds]]\n| [[Jerry Lewis]]\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 2\n| May 10, 1997\n|align=\"center\"| S22:E19\n| [[Phil Donahue]]\n| [[Marlon Brando]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 3\n| October 4, 1997\n|align=\"center\"| S23:E02\n| [[John Travolta]]\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"| [[Michael Keaton]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 4\n| May 9, 1998\n|align=\"center\"| S23:E22\n| [[Minnie Driver]]\n|[[Jeff Goldblum]]\n|rowspan=12|[[Sean Connery]]\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 5\n| October 24, 1998\n|align=\"center\"| S24:E04\n| [[Tom Cruise]]\n| [[Adam Sandler]]\n| Sandler is the first ''SNL'' cast member to be parodied.\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 6\n| March 20, 1999\n|align=\"center\"| S24:E16\n| [[Nicolas Cage]]\n| [[Calista Flockhart]]\n| Nicolas Cage finishes with $8\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 7\n| October 23, 1999\n|align=\"center\"| S25:E03\n| [[French Stewart]]\n| [[Burt Reynolds]]\n| Only episode with the four people (Ferrell, Fallon, Macdonald, Hammond) who appeared more than once.

The thirteenth edition of the sketch (Cosby, Sharon Osbourne, Connery) featured three members of the ''SNL'' cast as the three contestants and Ferrell, now hosting, reprising his role as Trebek.

The tenth sketch was one of two not to feature a host, as it was part of an ''SNL'' primetime special that did not feature a guest host. The 40th anniversary special also did not have a host.  Both Ferrell and Macdonald were previous cast members who reprised their ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' role upon their return. Notably, two hosts appeared as actual contestants on the real ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'', those being David Duchovny (in 1995 and 2010) and Martin Short (in 2006).\n\n*[[Alec Baldwin]] as [[Tony Bennett]]\n*[[Drew Barrymore]] as [[Calista Flockhart]]\n*[[Jim Carrey]] as [[Matthew McConaughey]]\n*[[David Duchovny]] as [[Jeff Goldblum]]\n*Will Ferrell as Alex Trebek\n*[[John Goodman]] as [[Marlon Brando]]\n*[[Tom Hanks]] as [[Tom Hanks]]\n*[[Lucy Liu]] as [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]\n*[[Norm Macdonald]] as [[Burt Reynolds]] (who changed his name to Turd Ferguson in several sketches, claiming \"it was a funny name\"). \n*[[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Keanu Reeves]]\n*[[Matthew Perry]] as [[Michael Keaton]]\n*[[Winona Ryder]] as [[Bj\u00f6rk]]\n*[[Martin Short]] as [[Jerry Lewis]]\n*[[Ben Stiller]] as [[Tom Cruise]]\n*[[Reese Witherspoon]] as [[Anne Heche]]\n\n==Background==\n[[Norm Macdonald]] was inspired to create the first ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' after noting how much easier the questions on the real-life ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' were compared to regular episodes. A fan of the sketch series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', Macdonald acknowledged that his concept would be substantially the same as \"Half-Wits,\" a recurring sketch on SCTV in which [[Eugene Levy]] played a parody of Trebek, exasperated by the incredibly dumb contestants on the program. Macdonald called Levy and secured permission to co-opt the premise of the sketch.<ref name=wapo_normmac>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/09/07/burt-reynolds-is-part-of-the-reason-snls-celebrity-jeopardy-sketch-exists/|title=Burt Reynolds is part of the reason SNL's Celebrity Jeopardy! sketch exists|first=Elade|last=Izahi|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the May 2007 special ''Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation'', Macdonald said he created the ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' sketch purely as an excuse to do his Burt Reynolds impersonation. He purposely chose to make Reynolds an anachronism, appearing on stage as if Reynolds was still the same age he was in 1972.<ref name=wapo_normmac/> Macdonald also claims that Reynolds was a fan of the sketch and that there were talks to do a sketch where the real Reynolds would crash the game and punch out Macdonald. Reynolds would then play the remainder of the game, with his responses being even dumber than Macdonald's. However, Macdonald was fired from ''SNL'' before that sketch could be written.<ref>Layser, Anthony (May 4, 2007).

Hammond said that, while his initial Connery impression was as accurate as possible, it would eventually morph into a \"bastardization\" of the actor, which audiences\u2014and Hammond himself\u2014found far more entertaining.<ref>Tom Shales, James Andrew Miller.

It parodies the [[Celebrity Jeopardy!|same-named special event]] on the television quiz show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' that features competition between notable individuals with all winnings going towards charitable organizations, and significant reductions to the game's level of difficulty. Fifteen sketches aired between December 1996 and February 2015: two sketches per season from [[Saturday Night Live (season 22)|1996]] to [[Saturday Night Live (season 27)|2002]]; and one each in [[Saturday Night Live (season 30)|2005]] and [[Saturday Night Live (season 34)|2009]], when Ferrell [[List of Saturday Night Live cast members who have hosted|returned to the show as host]]. The sketch was revived for the ''[[Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special]]'' on February 15, 2015.\n\nFerrell portrays ''Jeopardy!'' host [[Alex Trebek]]. [[Darrell Hammond]] also appeared in each sketch, usually portraying [[Sean Connery]], in an impersonation that typically involves crass insults directed at Trebek.<ref name=\"ign\">Phil Pirrello, Scott Collura (February 28, 2008).

[[IGN]].</ref> [[Norm Macdonald]] appeared as [[Burt Reynolds]] in six sketches. [[Jimmy Fallon]] also appeared six times, each time portraying a different character.\n\nOn several occasions, ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' sketches have been referenced during actual episodes of ''Jeopardy!''.<ref name=\"jeopardy episode\">{{cite episode|title=Show 5796 (Ben Davis vs. Cathy Sorge vs. Patrick Pence)|series=Jeopardy!|date=November 23, 2009|network =Syndicated}}</ref><ref name=\"jeopardy episode 2\">{{cite episode|title=Show 3908 (Bernard Pena vs. Kim Taylor vs. Ramsey Campbell)|series=Jeopardy!|date=September 5, 2001|network =Syndicated}}</ref><ref name=\"Surprise Me, Trebek!\">{{cite episode|title=Show 5098 (Regis Philbin vs. Nancy Grace vs. Carson Kressley)|series=Jeopardy!|date=November 8, 2006|network =Syndicated}}</ref><ref name=\"Answers That Start With 'Feb'\">{{cite episode|title=Show 5104 (Dana Delany vs. Brian Stokes Mitchell vs. Drew Lachey)|series=Jeopardy!|date=November 16, 2006|network =Syndicated}}</ref>\n\n==Sketch==\nThe sketch often begins at the start of the [[Jeopardy!#First two rounds|Double Jeopardy!]] round. Trebek welcomes the audience, and occasionally, apologizes for an offense or incident that occurred before the break. He then introduces the celebrity contestants, and reveals their scores, which are either $0, a negative score, or a very low positive score. Many times, the contestants refuse or fail to select an appropriate category and dollar value from the game board, grinding the game to a halt and often requiring Trebek to choose one himself. As the celebrities' growing ineptitude became apparent, the subject matter used for categories shifted from normal topics (such as \"Movies\" and \"Popular Music\") to more childish topics, categories with titles giving not-so-subtle hints as to the correct response without reading the clues (such as \"Famous [[Oprah]]s\"), and those requiring no responses whatsoever. Recurring ''Jeopardy!'' category \"Potent Potables\" appears in every sketch but is never selected, and when it finally is chosen, it results in an inadvertently offensive pre-recorded Video Daily Double involving [[Bill Cosby]].\n\nInstead of buzzing in with the correct questions, contestants either give horribly incorrect responses or say things that have nothing to do with the game, frustrating Trebek, who does nothing to hide his contempt for the celebrities' performance. Trebek's mood is also exacerbated by Connery's pranks and antics, which include making sexual jokes at Trebek's expense, deliberately [[dyslexia|misreading]] or [[vandalism|vandalizing]] the categories on the board to turn them into sexually suggestive phrases (such as \"The Pen is Mightier\", a category on literature, as \"The Penis Mightier\", which Connery suggests is a [[penis enlargement]] product), and implying that he has had sexual relations with the host's mother.\n\nTrebek eventually grows exasperated with his inability to conduct the show and cuts it short by moving to [[Jeopardy!#Final Jeopardy! Round|Final Jeopardy!]]. He either discards the scripted category in favor of a much easier task (such as having the celebrities write and respond to their own questions), or announces a childishly simple category. Even though it appears impossible for the celebrities to fail, they invariably do. Connery occasionally provides a correct response, yet uses his wager to transform the text into a rude phrase or drawing. Sometimes Connery appears to have sympathy for Trebek until the wager reveal, which happens to be a rude drawing at Trebek's expense; on an earlier sketch, this is also performed by [[John Travolta]], who in response to a clue asking the celebrities to name their favorite food, responds with \"[[miso]]\", an actual soup, yet when Trebek asks for the wager, reveals it to be \"horny\", which is read as \"me so horny\".\n\nTrebek is the beleaguered [[Double act|straight man]], and is generally the only person on stage interested in the game. The contestants, who are either unaware of what the game is or uninterested in playing, will ramble incoherently, deliver irrelevant monologues, or openly antagonize the host. Whenever a contestant takes the game seriously, they prove utterly incapable of supplying the correct question. No contestant ever offers a correct response; however, two come close: [[Phil Donahue]] and [[Tony Bennett]], who in their respective sketches, offer descriptions for the holiday of Christmas and ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''. When Reynolds, who had initially been the celebrity who appeared on each episode, makes his return appearances, he misreads categories in the same manner as Connery and insists that he be addressed as \"Turd Ferguson\" because he finds that name funny.\n\nAt the end of almost every sketch, all three celebrities have scores in the negative thousands of dollars, and in most cases, a humorous, often sexual, Final Jeopardy! punchline is delivered by Connery. In one of his sketches, Reynolds is declared an unquestioned winner, even though he wins simply because he has the least amount of negative money, rather than actually earning a victory.<ref>On the second Celebrity ''Jeopardy!'' sketch, from the ''SNL'' episode aired on May 10, 1997, Trebek declared Burt Reynolds the winner and announced that a $10,000 check would be awarded to Reynolds' charity, the Palm Beach Golf & Tennis Resort.  Please see [http://snltranscripts.jt.org/96/96sjeopardy.phtml this transcript]</ref> When Trebek ends the show, he either states that money will not be awarded to charity or announces his intention to resign or commit suicide.\n\n==Episodes==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!# \n!Original airdate \n!Episode \n!colspan=\"3\"|Celebrities impersonated\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 1\n| December 7, 1996\n|align=\"center\"| S22:E08\n| [[Sean Connery]]\n|rowspan=3| [[Burt Reynolds]]\n| [[Jerry Lewis]]\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 2\n| May 10, 1997\n|align=\"center\"| S22:E19\n| [[Phil Donahue]]\n| [[Marlon Brando]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 3\n| October 4, 1997\n|align=\"center\"| S23:E02\n| [[John Travolta]]\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"| [[Michael Keaton]]\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 4\n| May 9, 1998\n|align=\"center\"| S23:E22\n| [[Minnie Driver]]\n|[[Jeff Goldblum]]\n|rowspan=12|[[Sean Connery]]\n|-\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 5\n| October 24, 1998\n|align=\"center\"| S24:E04\n| [[Tom Cruise]]\n| [[Adam Sandler]]\n| Sandler is the first ''SNL'' cast member to be parodied.\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 6\n| March 20, 1999\n|align=\"center\"| S24:E16\n| [[Nicolas Cage]]\n| [[Calista Flockhart]]\n| Nicolas Cage finishes with $8\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 7\n| October 23, 1999\n|align=\"center\"| S25:E03\n| [[French Stewart]]\n| [[Burt Reynolds]]\n| Only episode with the four people (Ferrell, Fallon, Macdonald, Hammond) who appeared more than once.

The tenth sketch was one of two not to feature a host, as it was part of an ''SNL'' primetime special that did not feature a guest host. The 40th anniversary special also did not have a host.  Both Ferrell and Macdonald were previous cast members who reprised their ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' role upon their return.

A fan of the sketch series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', Macdonald acknowledged that his concept would be substantially the same as \"Half-Wits,\" a recurring sketch on SCTV in which [[Eugene Levy]] played a parody of Trebek, exasperated by the incredibly dumb contestants on the program. Macdonald called Levy and secured permission to co-opt the premise of the sketch.<ref name=wapo_normmac>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/09/07/burt-reynolds-is-part-of-the-reason-snls-celebrity-jeopardy-sketch-exists/|title=Burt Reynolds is part of the reason SNL's Celebrity Jeopardy! sketch exists|first=Elade|last=Izahi|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 7, 2018|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the May 2007 special ''Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation'', Macdonald said he created the ''Celebrity Jeopardy!'' sketch purely as an excuse to do his Burt Reynolds impersonation. He purposely chose to make Reynolds an anachronism, appearing on stage as if Reynolds was still the same age he was in 1972.<ref name=wapo_normmac/> Macdonald also claims that Reynolds was a fan of the sketch and that there were talks to do a sketch where the real Reynolds would crash the game and punch out Macdonald. Reynolds would then play the remainder of the game, with his responses being even dumber than Macdonald's. However, Macdonald was fired from ''SNL'' before that sketch could be written.<ref>Layser, Anthony (May 4, 2007).

Hammond said that, while his initial Connery impression was as accurate as possible, it would eventually morph into a \"bastardization\" of the actor, which audiences\u2014and Hammond himself\u2014found far more entertaining.<ref>Tom Shales, James Andrew Miller.

He participated in the [[Manhattan Project]], originated the [[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design|Teller\u2013Ulam design]] of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s, discovered the concept of the [[cellular automaton]], invented the [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo method of computation]], and suggested [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. In pure and [[applied mathematics]], he proved some theorems and proposed several conjectures.\n\nBorn into a wealthy [[Polish Jewish]] family, Ulam studied mathematics at the [[Lviv Polytechnic#Second Polish Republic|Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic Institute]], where he earned his [[PhD]] in 1933 under the supervision of [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. In 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he worked to establish important results regarding [[ergodic theory]]. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States for the last time with his 17-year-old brother [[Adam Ulam]]. He became an assistant professor at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in 1940, and a [[United States citizen]] in 1941.\n\nIn October 1943, he received an invitation from [[Hans Bethe]] to join the [[Manhattan Project]] at the secret [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico. There, he worked on the [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] calculations to predict the behavior of the [[explosive lens]]es that were needed by an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]]. He was assigned to [[Edward Teller]]'s group, where he worked on [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]] for Teller and [[Enrico Fermi]]. After the war he left to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]], but returned to Los Alamos in 1946 to work on [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]]. With the aid of a cadre of female \"[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|computers]]\", including his wife [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam]], he found that Teller's \"Super\" design was unworkable. In January 1951, Ulam and Teller came up with the [[Teller\u2013Ulam design]], which is the basis for all thermonuclear weapons.\n\nUlam considered the problem of [[nuclear propulsion]] of rockets, which was pursued by [[Project Rover]], and proposed, as an alternative to Rover's [[nuclear thermal rocket]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion, which became [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]. With Fermi, [[John Pasta]], and [[Mary Tsingou]], Ulam studied the [[Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem]], which became the inspiration for the field of non-linear science. He is probably best known for realising that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the [[Monte Carlo method]] has become a common and standard approach to many problems.\n\n==Poland==\nUlam was born in [[Lviv#Habsburg Empire|Lemberg]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], on 3 April 1909.<ref name=\"CHAR 78\" /><ref name='NYTIMES-OBIT' /> At this time, Galicia was in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], known to Poles as the [[Austrian partition]]. In 1918, it became part of the newly restored Poland, the [[Second Polish Republic]], and the city took its Polish name again, [[Lviv#Second Polish Republic|Lw\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"ULAM 9-15\"/>\n\nThe Ulams were a wealthy [[Polish Jewish]] family of bankers, industrialists, and other professionals.

Its founders were [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and [[Stefan Banach]], who were professors at the [[University of Lviv#Jan Kazimierz University (1919\u201339)|Jan Kazimierz University]]. Mathematicians of this \"school\" met for long hours at the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where the problems they discussed were collected in the [[Scottish Book]], a thick notebook provided by Banach's wife. Ulam was a major contributor to the book. Of the 193 problems recorded between 1935 and 1941, he contributed 40 problems as a single author, another 11 with Banach and Mazur, and an additional 15 with others. In 1957, he received from Steinhaus a copy of the book, which had survived the war, and translated it into English.<ref name='BOOK'/> In 1981, Ulam's friend R. Daniel Maudlin published an expanded and annotated version.<ref name='MAUDLIN'/>\n\n==Coming to the US==\nIn 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], for a few months. In December of that year, Ulam sailed to the US. At Princeton, he went to lectures and seminars, where he heard [[Oswald Veblen]], [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. During a tea party at von Neumann's house, he encountered [[G. D. Birkhoff]], who suggested that he apply for a position with the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].<ref name='VITA'/> Following up on Birkhoff's suggestion, Ulam spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] from 1936 to 1939, where he worked with [[John C. Oxtoby]] to establish results regarding [[ergodic theory]]. These appeared in [[Annals of Mathematics]] in 1941.<ref name='AJMAA'/><ref name='OXTOBY'/>\n\nOn 20 August 1939, in [[Gdynia]], J\u00f3zef Ulam, along with his brother Szymon, put his two sons, Stanislaw and 17 year old [[Adam Ulam|Adam]], on a ship headed for the US.<ref name='VITA'/> Eleven days later, the [[Invasion of Poland#Phase 1: German invasion|Germans invaded Poland]]. Within two months, the Germans completed their [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation]] of western Poland, and the Soviets [[Invasion of Poland#Phase 2: Soviet invasion|invaded]] and occupied eastern Poland. Within two years, J\u00f3zef Ulam and the rest of his family were victims of the [[Holocaust]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]] was in hiding, [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] was lecturing at the [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university]] in Warsaw, [[W\u0142odzimierz Sto\u017cek]] and his two sons had been killed in the [[massacre of Lw\u00f3w professors]], and the last problem had been recorded in the [[Scottish Book]]. [[Stefan Banach]] survived the Nazi occupation by feeding [[lice]] at [[Rudolf Weigl|Rudolf Weigl's typhus research institute]]. In 1963, [[Adam Ulam]], who had become an eminent [[Kremlinology|kremlinologist]] at Harvard,<ref name='ADAM'/> received a letter from George Volsky,<ref name='VOLSKY'/> who hid in J\u00f3zef Ulam's house after deserting from the Polish army. This reminiscence gave a chilling account of Lw\u00f3w's chaotic scenes in late 1939.<ref name='MOLLY'/> In later life Ulam described himself as \"an agnostic. Sometimes I muse deeply on the forces that are for me invisible. When I am almost close to the idea of God, I feel immediately estranged by the horrors of this world, which he seems to tolerate\".<ref name='OLGIERD'/>\n\nIn 1940, after being recommended by Birkhoff, Ulam became an assistant professor at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. Here, he became a [[United States citizen]] in 1941.<ref name='VITA'/> That year, he married [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam|Fran\u00e7oise Aron]].<ref name='AJMAA'/> She had been a French exchange student at [[Mount Holyoke College]], whom he met in Cambridge.

In October, he received an invitation to join an unidentified project near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref name='VITA'/> The letter was signed by [[Hans Bethe]], who had been appointed as leader of the theoretical division of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by [[Robert Oppenheimer]], its scientific director.<ref name=\"ULAM 143-147\"/> Knowing nothing of the area, he borrowed a New Mexico guide book. On the checkout card, he found the names of his Wisconsin colleagues, [[Joan Hinton]], [[David H. Frisch|David Frisch]], and Joseph McKibben, all of whom had mysteriously disappeared.<ref name='VITA'/> This was Ulam's introduction to the [[Manhattan Project]], which was the US's wartime effort to create the atomic bomb.<ref name='LANLBIO'/>\n\n===Hydrodynamical calculations of implosion===\nA few weeks after Ulam reached [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] in February 1944, the project experienced a crisis. In April, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8|Emilio Segr\u00e8]] discovered that [[plutonium]] made in [[Nuclear reactors#Early reactors|reactors]] would not work in a [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] plutonium weapon like the \"[[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]\", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the \"[[Little Boy]]\" that was dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima]]. This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the [[Hanford site]] and to make slow [[Isotope separation|separation of uranium isotopes]] the only way to prepare [[fissile]] material suitable for use in bombs. To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]] and appointed [[George Kistiakowsky]] head of the implosion department. He was a professor at Harvard and an expert on precise use of explosives.<ref name=\"HODDESON 130-137\"/>\n\nThe basic concept of [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] is to use chemical explosives to crush a chunk of fissile material into a [[critical mass]], where [[neutron]] multiplication leads to a [[nuclear chain reaction]], releasing a large amount of energy.  Cylindrical implosive configurations had been studied by [[Seth Neddermeyer]], but von Neumann, who had experience with [[shaped charges]] used in [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead|armor-piercing ammunition]], was a [[John von Neumann#Nuclear weapons|vocal advocate of spherical implosion]] driven by [[explosive lens]]es.  He realized that the symmetry and speed with which implosion compressed the plutonium were critical issues,<ref name=\"HODDESON 130-137\"/> and enlisted Ulam to help design lens configurations that would provide nearly spherical implosion.  Within an implosion, because of enormous pressures and high temperatures, solid materials behave much like fluids.  This meant that  [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamical]] calculations were needed to predict and minimize asymmetries that would spoil a nuclear detonation.  Of these calculations, Ulam said:{{quote|The hydrodynamical problem was simply stated, but very difficult to calculate&nbsp;\u2013 not only in detail, but even in order of magnitude.  In this discussion, I stressed pure pragmatism and the necessity to get a heuristic survey of the problem by simple-minded brute force, rather than by massive numerical work.<ref name='VITA'/>}}\n\nNevertheless, with the primitive facilities available at the time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations that led to a satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years,<ref name='COMPEARLY'/> continued through the cold war, and still exists.<ref name='COMPLATE'/> [[Otto Frisch]] remembered Ulam as \"a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he told me that he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!\"<ref name='FRISCH'/>\n\n===Statistics of branching and multiplicative processes===\nEven the inherent statistical fluctuations of [[neutron]] multiplication within a [[chain reaction]] have implications with regard to implosion speed and symmetry. In November 1944, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]]<ref name='HAWKINS'/> and Ulam addressed this problem in a report entitled \"Theory of Multiplicative Processes\".<ref name='LA171'/> This report, which invokes [[probability-generating function]]s, is also an early entry in the extensive literature on statistics of [[Branching process|branching]] and multiplicative processes. In 1948, its scope was extended by Ulam and Everett.<ref name='MULT123'/>\n\nEarly in the Manhattan project, [[Enrico Fermi]]'s attention was focused on the use of reactors to produce plutonium. In September 1944, he arrived at Los Alamos, shortly after breathing life into the [[Manhattan Project#Hanford reactors|first Hanford reactor]], which had been [[Nuclear poison|poisoned]] by a [[Xenon-135|xenon isotope]].<ref name=\"HEWLETT\"/> Soon after Fermi's arrival, [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]] group, of which Ulam was a part, was transferred to a new division headed by Fermi.<ref name=\"ULAM 152-153\"/> Fermi and Ulam formed a relationship that became very fruitful after the war.<ref name=\"ULAM 162-167\"/>\n\n==Post war Los Alamos==\nIn September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of [[encephalitis]], which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. During his recuperation, many friends visited, including [[Nicholas Metropolis]] from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician [[Paul Erd\u0151s]],<ref name='ERDOS'/> who remarked: \"Stan, you are just like before.\"<ref name='VITA'/> This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. Another friend, [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and [[biology]]; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for hours on end doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation.<ref name='ROTA'/> This assertion was not accepted by [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam]].<ref name='FULAM'/>\n\nBy late April 1946, Ulam had recovered enough to attend a secret conference at Los Alamos to discuss [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]]. Those in attendance included Ulam, von Neumann, Metropolis, Teller, [[Stan Frankel]], and others. Throughout his participation in the Manhattan Project, Teller's efforts had been directed toward the development of a \"super\" weapon based on [[nuclear fusion]], rather than toward development of a practical fission bomb. After extensive discussion, the participants reached a consensus that his ideas were worthy of further exploration. A few weeks later, Ulam received an offer of a position at Los Alamos from Metropolis and [[Robert D. Richtmyer]], the new head of its theoretical division, at a higher salary, and the Ulams returned to Los Alamos.<ref name=\"ULAM 184-187\"/>\n\n===Monte Carlo method===\n[[File:STAN ULAM HOLDING THE FERMIAC.jpg|thumb|300px|Stan Ulam Holding the [[FERMIAC]]|alt=A smiling balding man in a suit and tie holds a strange device that looks like a frame]]\nLate in the war, under the sponsorship of von Neumann, Frankel and Metropolis began to carry out calculations on the first general-purpose electronic computer, the [[ENIAC]] at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Shortly after returning to Los Alamos, Ulam participated in a review of results from these calculations.<ref name='METROPOLIS'/> Earlier, while playing [[Patience (game)|solitaire]] during his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome.<ref name='ECKHARDT'/> With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods very practical. John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March 1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material.<ref name='LAMS551'/> Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle, Micha\u0142 Ulam, \"who just had to go to Monte Carlo\" to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach \"The [[Monte Carlo method]]\".<ref name='METROPOLIS'/> Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.<ref name='MONTEPAPER'/>\n\nFermi, learning of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an [[analog computer]] known as the [[Monte Carlo trolley]], later dubbed the [[FERMIAC]]. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern [[massively parallel]] [[supercomputer]]s are [[embarrassingly parallel]] applications, whose results can be very accurate.<ref name='COMPLATE'/>\n\n===Teller\u2013Ulam design===\nOn 29 August 1949, the [[Soviet Union]] tested its first fission bomb, the [[RDS-1]]. Created under the supervision of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who sought to duplicate the US effort, this weapon was nearly identical to [[Fat Man]], for its design was based on information provided by spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]]. In response, on 31 January 1950, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] announced a crash program to develop a fusion bomb.<ref name='DUNCAN'/>\n\nTo advocate an aggressive development program, [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] came to Los Alamos, where they conferred with [[Norris Bradbury]], the laboratory director, and with [[George Gamow]], [[Edward Teller]], and Ulam. Soon, these three became members of a short-lived committee appointed by Bradbury to study the problem, with Teller as chairman.<ref name='VITA'/> At this time, research on the use of a fission weapon to create a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]] had been ongoing since 1942, but the design was still essentially the one originally proposed by Teller. His concept was to put [[tritium]] and/or [[deuterium]] in close proximity to a fission bomb, with the hope that the heat and intense flux of neutrons released when the bomb exploded, would ignite a self-sustaining [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]]. Reactions of these [[isotopes of hydrogen]] are of interest because the energy per unit mass of fuel released by their fusion is much larger than that from fission of heavy nuclei.<ref name=\"RHODES\"/>\n\n[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Ivy Mike]], the first full test of the Teller\u2013Ulam design (a [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged]] fusion bomb), with a [[TNT equivalent|yield]] of 10.4 megatons on 1 November 1952|alt=A mushroom cloud lights up the dawn sky]]\nBecause the results of calculations based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it [[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design#Teller's \"Super\"|could not lead to a successful weapon]], while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding. Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer.<ref name= \"HEWLETT AND DUNCAN\"/> To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible. To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, [[MANIAC I|MANIAC]], at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos. Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition. [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam|Fran\u00e7oise Ulam]] was one of a cadre of women \"[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|computers]]\" who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on [[mechanical calculator]]s, supplemented and confirmed by Everett's [[slide rule]]. Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios. The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in [[combinatorics]] to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was much more complicated than the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering.<ref name='GALISON'/> In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann's results.<ref name='FULAM'/><ref name=\"RHODES 422-424\"/>\n\nIn January 1951, Ulam had another idea: to channel the mechanical shock of a nuclear explosion so as to compress the fusion fuel. On the recommendation of his wife,<ref name='FULAM'/> Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it.<ref name='MARKBIO'/> Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft [[X-rays]] from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect. On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations.<ref name='LAMS1225'/> A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a [[fissile]] rod or cylinder at the center of the fusion fuel. The detonation of this \"spark plug\"<ref name='LAMS1230'/> would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction. The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often described as the \"[[Teller\u2013Ulam design]]\".<ref name=\"RHODES 455-464\"/>\n\n[[File:Ivy Mike Sausage device.jpg|thumb|The ''Sausage'' device of [[Ivy Mike|Mike]] nuclear test (yield 10.4 Mt) on [[Enewetak Atoll]]. The test was part of the [[Operation Ivy]]. The Sausage was the first true H-Bomb ever tested, meaning the first [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] device built upon the [[Teller\u2013Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] principles of staged radiation implosion.|alt=Tiny men and a large silver cylindrical object connected to a lot of scaffolding and tubes]]\nIn September 1951, after a series of differences with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago.<ref name=\"HEWLETT AND DUNCAN 554-556\"/> At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester.<ref name=\"ULAM 220-224\"/> Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design<ref name='LAMS1225'/> and jointly applied for a patent on it,<ref name='LANLBIO'/> they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit.<ref name='MARKBIO'/> After the war, Bethe returned to [[Cornell University]], but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant. In 1954, he wrote an article on the history of the H-bomb,<ref name='BETHE'/> which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough. This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role.<ref name = 'UCHII'/> \"After the H-bomb was made,\" Bethe recalled, \"reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the midwife.\"<ref name=SCHWEBER/>\n\nWith the basic fusion reactions confirmed, and with a feasible design in hand, there was nothing to prevent Los Alamos from testing a thermonuclear device. On 1 November 1952, the first thermonuclear explosion occurred when [[Ivy Mike]] was detonated on [[Enewetak Atoll]], within the US [[Pacific Proving Grounds]]. This device, which used liquid deuterium as its fusion fuel, was immense and utterly unusable as a weapon. Nevertheless, its success validated the Teller\u2013Ulam design, and stimulated intensive development of practical weapons.<ref name=\"ULAM 220-224\"/>\n\n===Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem===\n{{main|Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem}}\nWhen Ulam returned to Los Alamos, his attention turned away from weapon design and toward the use of computers to investigate problems in physics and mathematics. With [[John Pasta]], who helped Metropolis to bring MANIAC on line in March 1952, he explored these ideas in a report \"Heuristic Studies in Problems of Mathematical Physics on High Speed Computing Machines\", which was submitted on 9 June 1953. It treated several problems that cannot be addressed within the framework of traditional analytic methods: billowing of fluids, rotational motion in gravitating systems, magnetic lines of force, and hydrodynamic instabilities.<ref name='LA1557'/>\n\nSoon, Pasta and Ulam became experienced with electronic computation on MANIAC, and by this time, Enrico Fermi had settled into a routine of spending academic years at the University of Chicago and summers at Los Alamos. During these summer visits, Pasta, Ulam, and [[Mary Tsingou]], a programmer in the MANIAC group, joined him to study a variation of the classic problem of a string of masses held together by springs that exert forces linearly proportional to their displacement from equilibrium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dauxois|first1=Thierry|title=Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and a mysterious lady|journal=Physics Today|date=2008|volume=6|issue=1|pages=55\u201357|url=http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/thierry.dauxois/PAPERS/pt61_55.2008.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2017|doi=10.1063/1.2835154|arxiv=0801.1590|bibcode=2008PhT....61a..55D}}</ref> Fermi proposed to add to this force a nonlinear component, which could be chosen to be proportional to either the square or cube of the displacement, or to a more complicated \"broken linear\" function. This addition is the key element of the [[Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem]], which is often designated by the abbreviation FPUT.<ref name='LA1940'/><ref name='FPU'/>\n\nA classical spring system can be described in terms of vibrational modes, which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string. If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop. With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes. This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode.<ref name='FPU'/> This behavior is very different from the expected [[Equipartition theorem|equipartition of energy]]. It remained mysterious until 1965, when [[Martin David Kruskal|Kruskal]] and [[Norman Zabusky|Zabusky]] showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the system can be described by the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]], which is the prototype of nonlinear [[partial differential equations]] that have [[soliton]] solutions. This means that FPUT behavior can be understood in terms of solitons.<ref name=\"CHAOS\"/>\n\n===Nuclear propulsion===\n[[File:NASA-project-orion-artist.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An artist's conception of the NASA reference design for the Project Orion spacecraft powered by nuclear propulsion|alt=A painting of a spacecraft passing a Jupiter-like planet]]\nStarting in 1955, Ulam and [[Frederick Reines]] considered [[nuclear propulsion]] of aircraft and rockets.<ref name='LAMS2186'/> This is an attractive possibility, because the nuclear energy per unit mass of fuel is a million times greater than that available from chemicals. From 1955 to 1972, their ideas were pursued during [[Project Rover]], which explored the use of nuclear reactors to power rockets.<ref name=\"ULAM 249-254\"/> In response to a question by Senator [[John O. Pastore]] at a congressional committee hearing on \"Outer Space Propulsion by Nuclear Energy\", on January 22, 1958, Ulam replied that \"the future as a whole of mankind is to some extent involved inexorably now with going outside the globe.\"<ref name='HEARING'/>\n\nUlam and C. J. Everett also proposed, in contrast to [[Nuclear thermal rocket|Rover's continuous heating of rocket exhaust]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion.<ref name='LAMS1955'/> [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] was a study of this idea. It began in 1958 and ended in 1965, after the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and in space.<ref name='ORION'/> Work on this project was spearheaded by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]], who commented on the decision to end Orion in his article, \"Death of a Project\".<ref name='DEATH'/>\n\nBradbury appointed Ulam and [[John H. Manley]] as research advisors to the laboratory director in 1957. These newly created positions were on the same administrative level as division leaders, and Ulam held his until he retired from Los Alamos. In this capacity, he was able to influence and guide programs in many divisions: theoretical, physics, chemistry, metallurgy, weapons, health, Rover, and others.<ref name='ULAM 249-254'/>\n\nIn addition to these activities, Ulam continued to publish technical reports and research papers. One of these introduced the [[Fermi\u2013Ulam model]], an extension of Fermi's theory of [[Fermi acceleration|the acceleration of cosmic rays]].<ref name='FUM'/> Another, with Paul Stein and [[Mary Tsingou]], titled \"Quadratic Transformations\", was an early investigation of [[chaos theory]] and is considered the first published use of the phrase \"[[chaotic behavior]]\".<ref name='ABRAHAM' /><ref name='LA-2305'/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Return to academia==\n[[File:Ulam 1.png|thumb|300px|When the positive integers are arrayed along the [[Ulam spiral]], prime numbers, represented by dots, tend to collect along diagonal lines.|alt=A lot of dots, but forming diagonal lines]]\nDuring his years at Los Alamos, Ulam was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1951 to 1952, [[MIT]] from 1956 to 1957, the [[University of California, San Diego]], in 1963, and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] from 1961 to 1962 and 1965 to 1967. In 1967, the last of these positions became permanent, when Ulam was appointed as professor and Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at [[Boulder, Colorado]]. He kept a residence in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which made it convenient to spend summers at Los Alamos as a consultant.<ref name=\"AIP\"/>\n\nIn Colorado, where he rejoined his friends Gamow, Richtmyer, and Hawkins, Ulam's research interests turned toward [[biology]]. In 1968, recognizing this emphasis, the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado School of Medicine]] appointed Ulam as Professor of Biomathematics, and he held this position until his death. With his Los Alamos colleague Robert Schrandt he published a report, \"Some Elementary Attempts at Numerical Modeling of Problems Concerning Rates of Evolutionary Processes\", which applied his earlier ideas on branching processes to biological inheritance.<ref name='LA-4246'/> Another, report, with William Beyer, [[Temple F. Smith]], and M. L. Stein, titled \"Metrics in Biology\", introduced new ideas about biometric distances.<ref name='LA-4973'/>\n\nWhen he retired from Colorado in 1975, Ulam had begun to spend winter semesters at the [[University of Florida]], where he was a graduate research professor. Except for [[sabbatical]]s at the [[University of California, Davis]] from 1982 to 1983, and at [[Rockefeller University]] from 1980 to 1984,<ref name=\"AIP\"/> this pattern of spending summers in Colorado and Los Alamos and winters in Florida continued until Ulam died of an apparent heart attack in Santa Fe on 13 May 1984.<ref name='NYTIMES-OBIT'/>\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] noted that \"he died suddenly of heart failure, without fear or pain, while he could still prove and conjecture.\"<ref name=\"ERDOS\"/> In 1987, [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam|Fran\u00e7oise Ulam]] deposited his papers with the [[American Philosophical Society]] Library in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"PAPERS\"/> She continued to live in Santa Fe until she died on 30 April 2011, at the age of 93.

With the Cold War, the theory changed emphasizing that market economy was superior and the only sensible way. In Paul Samuelson\u00b4s \u201cEconomics: An Introductory Analysis \u201d, 1948, Adam Smith\u00b4s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d was only a footnote. In later editions, it became the central theme. \n\nAs Samuelson <ref>The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, vol. iii, p. 683, MIT Press 1966 </ref> remembers all this was challenged by Stanislaw Ulam: \u201c[Y]ears ago \u2026 I was in the Society of Fellows at Harvard along with the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Ulam, who was to become an originator of the Monte Carlo method and co-discoverer of the hydrogen-bomb, \u2026 used to tease me by saying, \u2018Name me one proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and non-trivial.\u2019 This was the test that I always failed. But now, some thirty years later \u2026 an appropriate answer occurs to me: The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage \u2026 . That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that it is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them.\"\n\n==Impact and legacy==\nFrom the publication of his first paper as a student in 1929 until his death, Ulam was constantly writing on mathematics.

He participated in the [[Manhattan Project]], originated the [[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design|Teller\u2013Ulam design]] of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s, discovered the concept of the [[cellular automaton]], invented the [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo method of computation]], and suggested [[nuclear pulse propulsion]]. In pure and [[applied mathematics]], he proved some theorems and proposed several conjectures.\n\nBorn into a wealthy [[Polish Jewish]] family, Ulam studied mathematics at the [[Lviv Polytechnic#Second Polish Republic|Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic Institute]], where he earned his [[PhD]] in 1933 under the supervision of [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. In 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he worked to establish important results regarding [[ergodic theory]]. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States for the last time with his 17-year-old brother [[Adam Ulam]]. He became an assistant professor at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in 1940, and a [[United States citizen]] in 1941.\n\nIn October 1943, he received an invitation from [[Hans Bethe]] to join the [[Manhattan Project]] at the secret [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico. There, he worked on the [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] calculations to predict the behavior of the [[explosive lens]]es that were needed by an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]]. He was assigned to [[Edward Teller]]'s group, where he worked on [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]] for Teller and [[Enrico Fermi]]. After the war he left to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]], but returned to Los Alamos in 1946 to work on [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]]. With the aid of a cadre of female \"[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|computers]]\", including his wife [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam]], he found that Teller's \"Super\" design was unworkable. In January 1951, Ulam and Teller came up with the [[Teller\u2013Ulam design]], which is the basis for all thermonuclear weapons.\n\nUlam considered the problem of [[nuclear propulsion]] of rockets, which was pursued by [[Project Rover]], and proposed, as an alternative to Rover's [[nuclear thermal rocket]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion, which became [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]. With Fermi, [[John Pasta]], and [[Mary Tsingou]], Ulam studied the [[Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem]], which became the inspiration for the field of non-linear science. He is probably best known for realising that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the [[Monte Carlo method]] has become a common and standard approach to many problems.\n\n==Poland==\nUlam was born in [[Lviv#Habsburg Empire|Lemberg]], [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], on 3 April 1909.<ref name=\"CHAR 78\" /><ref name='NYTIMES-OBIT' /> At this time, Galicia was in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], known to Poles as the [[Austrian partition]].

Its founders were [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and [[Stefan Banach]], who were professors at the [[University of Lviv#Jan Kazimierz University (1919\u201339)|Jan Kazimierz University]]. Mathematicians of this \"school\" met for long hours at the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where the problems they discussed were collected in the [[Scottish Book]], a thick notebook provided by Banach's wife. Ulam was a major contributor to the book. Of the 193 problems recorded between 1935 and 1941, he contributed 40 problems as a single author, another 11 with Banach and Mazur, and an additional 15 with others. In 1957, he received from Steinhaus a copy of the book, which had survived the war, and translated it into English.<ref name='BOOK'/> In 1981, Ulam's friend R. Daniel Maudlin published an expanded and annotated version.<ref name='MAUDLIN'/>\n\n==Coming to the US==\nIn 1935, [[John von Neumann]], whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], for a few months. In December of that year, Ulam sailed to the US. At Princeton, he went to lectures and seminars, where he heard [[Oswald Veblen]], [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. During a tea party at von Neumann's house, he encountered [[G. D. Birkhoff]], who suggested that he apply for a position with the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].<ref name='VITA'/> Following up on Birkhoff's suggestion, Ulam spent summers in Poland and academic years at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] from 1936 to 1939, where he worked with [[John C. Oxtoby]] to establish results regarding [[ergodic theory]]. These appeared in [[Annals of Mathematics]] in 1941.<ref name='AJMAA'/><ref name='OXTOBY'/>\n\nOn 20 August 1939, in [[Gdynia]], J\u00f3zef Ulam, along with his brother Szymon, put his two sons, Stanislaw and 17 year old [[Adam Ulam|Adam]], on a ship headed for the US.<ref name='VITA'/> Eleven days later, the [[Invasion of Poland#Phase 1: German invasion|Germans invaded Poland]]. Within two months, the Germans completed their [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation]] of western Poland, and the Soviets [[Invasion of Poland#Phase 2: Soviet invasion|invaded]] and occupied eastern Poland. Within two years, J\u00f3zef Ulam and the rest of his family were victims of the [[Holocaust]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]] was in hiding, [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] was lecturing at the [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground university]] in Warsaw, [[W\u0142odzimierz Sto\u017cek]] and his two sons had been killed in the [[massacre of Lw\u00f3w professors]], and the last problem had been recorded in the [[Scottish Book]]. [[Stefan Banach]] survived the Nazi occupation by feeding [[lice]] at [[Rudolf Weigl|Rudolf Weigl's typhus research institute]]. In 1963, [[Adam Ulam]], who had become an eminent [[Kremlinology|kremlinologist]] at Harvard,<ref name='ADAM'/> received a letter from George Volsky,<ref name='VOLSKY'/> who hid in J\u00f3zef Ulam's house after deserting from the Polish army. This reminiscence gave a chilling account of Lw\u00f3w's chaotic scenes in late 1939.<ref name='MOLLY'/> In later life Ulam described himself as \"an agnostic. Sometimes I muse deeply on the forces that are for me invisible. When I am almost close to the idea of God, I feel immediately estranged by the horrors of this world, which he seems to tolerate\".<ref name='OLGIERD'/>\n\nIn 1940, after being recommended by Birkhoff, Ulam became an assistant professor at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. Here, he became a [[United States citizen]] in 1941.<ref name='VITA'/> That year, he married [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam|Fran\u00e7oise Aron]].<ref name='AJMAA'/> She had been a French exchange student at [[Mount Holyoke College]], whom he met in Cambridge. They had one daughter, Claire. In Madison, Ulam met his friend and colleague C. J. Everett, with whom he would collaborate on a number of papers.<ref name=\"ULAM 125-130\"/>\n\n==Manhattan Project==\n[[File:Stanislaw Ulam ID badge.png|thumb|200px|Ulam's ID badge photo from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] |alt=A mug shot style ID photo, with the serial H 0]]\nIn early 1943, Ulam asked von Neumann to find him a war job. In October, he received an invitation to join an unidentified project near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref name='VITA'/> The letter was signed by [[Hans Bethe]], who had been appointed as leader of the theoretical division of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] by [[Robert Oppenheimer]], its scientific director.<ref name=\"ULAM 143-147\"/> Knowing nothing of the area, he borrowed a New Mexico guide book. On the checkout card, he found the names of his Wisconsin colleagues, [[Joan Hinton]], [[David H. Frisch|David Frisch]], and Joseph McKibben, all of whom had mysteriously disappeared.<ref name='VITA'/> This was Ulam's introduction to the [[Manhattan Project]], which was the US's wartime effort to create the atomic bomb.<ref name='LANLBIO'/>\n\n===Hydrodynamical calculations of implosion===\nA few weeks after Ulam reached [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]] in February 1944, the project experienced a crisis. In April, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8|Emilio Segr\u00e8]] discovered that [[plutonium]] made in [[Nuclear reactors#Early reactors|reactors]] would not work in a [[gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] plutonium weapon like the \"[[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]]\", which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the \"[[Little Boy]]\" that was dropped on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|Hiroshima]]. This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the [[Hanford site]] and to make slow [[Isotope separation|separation of uranium isotopes]] the only way to prepare [[fissile]] material suitable for use in bombs. To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion-type weapon]] and appointed [[George Kistiakowsky]] head of the implosion department. He was a professor at Harvard and an expert on precise use of explosives.<ref name=\"HODDESON 130-137\"/>\n\nThe basic concept of [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] is to use chemical explosives to crush a chunk of fissile material into a [[critical mass]], where [[neutron]] multiplication leads to a [[nuclear chain reaction]], releasing a large amount of energy.  Cylindrical implosive configurations had been studied by [[Seth Neddermeyer]], but von Neumann, who had experience with [[shaped charges]] used in [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead|armor-piercing ammunition]], was a [[John von Neumann#Nuclear weapons|vocal advocate of spherical implosion]] driven by [[explosive lens]]es.  He realized that the symmetry and speed with which implosion compressed the plutonium were critical issues,<ref name=\"HODDESON 130-137\"/> and enlisted Ulam to help design lens configurations that would provide nearly spherical implosion.  Within an implosion, because of enormous pressures and high temperatures, solid materials behave much like fluids.  This meant that  [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamical]] calculations were needed to predict and minimize asymmetries that would spoil a nuclear detonation.  Of these calculations, Ulam said:{{quote|The hydrodynamical problem was simply stated, but very difficult to calculate&nbsp;\u2013 not only in detail, but even in order of magnitude.  In this discussion, I stressed pure pragmatism and the necessity to get a heuristic survey of the problem by simple-minded brute force, rather than by massive numerical work.<ref name='VITA'/>}}\n\nNevertheless, with the primitive facilities available at the time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations that led to a satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years,<ref name='COMPEARLY'/> continued through the cold war, and still exists.<ref name='COMPLATE'/> [[Otto Frisch]] remembered Ulam as \"a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he told me that he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!\"<ref name='FRISCH'/>\n\n===Statistics of branching and multiplicative processes===\nEven the inherent statistical fluctuations of [[neutron]] multiplication within a [[chain reaction]] have implications with regard to implosion speed and symmetry. In November 1944, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]]<ref name='HAWKINS'/> and Ulam addressed this problem in a report entitled \"Theory of Multiplicative Processes\".<ref name='LA171'/> This report, which invokes [[probability-generating function]]s, is also an early entry in the extensive literature on statistics of [[Branching process|branching]] and multiplicative processes. In 1948, its scope was extended by Ulam and Everett.<ref name='MULT123'/>\n\nEarly in the Manhattan project, [[Enrico Fermi]]'s attention was focused on the use of reactors to produce plutonium. In September 1944, he arrived at Los Alamos, shortly after breathing life into the [[Manhattan Project#Hanford reactors|first Hanford reactor]], which had been [[Nuclear poison|poisoned]] by a [[Xenon-135|xenon isotope]].<ref name=\"HEWLETT\"/> Soon after Fermi's arrival, [[Teller's \"Super\" bomb]] group, of which Ulam was a part, was transferred to a new division headed by Fermi.<ref name=\"ULAM 152-153\"/> Fermi and Ulam formed a relationship that became very fruitful after the war.<ref name=\"ULAM 162-167\"/>\n\n==Post war Los Alamos==\nIn September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of [[encephalitis]], which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. During his recuperation, many friends visited, including [[Nicholas Metropolis]] from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician [[Paul Erd\u0151s]],<ref name='ERDOS'/> who remarked: \"Stan, you are just like before.\"<ref name='VITA'/> This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. Another friend, [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and [[biology]]; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for hours on end doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation.<ref name='ROTA'/> This assertion was not accepted by [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam]].<ref name='FULAM'/>\n\nBy late April 1946, Ulam had recovered enough to attend a secret conference at Los Alamos to discuss [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapons]]. Those in attendance included Ulam, von Neumann, Metropolis, Teller, [[Stan Frankel]], and others. Throughout his participation in the Manhattan Project, Teller's efforts had been directed toward the development of a \"super\" weapon based on [[nuclear fusion]], rather than toward development of a practical fission bomb. After extensive discussion, the participants reached a consensus that his ideas were worthy of further exploration. A few weeks later, Ulam received an offer of a position at Los Alamos from Metropolis and [[Robert D. Richtmyer]], the new head of its theoretical division, at a higher salary, and the Ulams returned to Los Alamos.<ref name=\"ULAM 184-187\"/>\n\n===Monte Carlo method===\n[[File:STAN ULAM HOLDING THE FERMIAC.jpg|thumb|300px|Stan Ulam Holding the [[FERMIAC]]|alt=A smiling balding man in a suit and tie holds a strange device that looks like a frame]]\nLate in the war, under the sponsorship of von Neumann, Frankel and Metropolis began to carry out calculations on the first general-purpose electronic computer, the [[ENIAC]] at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Shortly after returning to Los Alamos, Ulam participated in a review of results from these calculations.<ref name='METROPOLIS'/> Earlier, while playing [[Patience (game)|solitaire]] during his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome.<ref name='ECKHARDT'/> With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods very practical. John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March 1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material.<ref name='LAMS551'/> Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle, Micha\u0142 Ulam, \"who just had to go to Monte Carlo\" to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach \"The [[Monte Carlo method]]\".<ref name='METROPOLIS'/> Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.<ref name='MONTEPAPER'/>\n\nFermi, learning of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an [[analog computer]] known as the [[Monte Carlo trolley]], later dubbed the [[FERMIAC]]. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern [[massively parallel]] [[supercomputer]]s are [[embarrassingly parallel]] applications, whose results can be very accurate.<ref name='COMPLATE'/>\n\n===Teller\u2013Ulam design===\nOn 29 August 1949, the [[Soviet Union]] tested its first fission bomb, the [[RDS-1]]. Created under the supervision of [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who sought to duplicate the US effort, this weapon was nearly identical to [[Fat Man]], for its design was based on information provided by spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]]. In response, on 31 January 1950, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] announced a crash program to develop a fusion bomb.<ref name='DUNCAN'/>\n\nTo advocate an aggressive development program, [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] came to Los Alamos, where they conferred with [[Norris Bradbury]], the laboratory director, and with [[George Gamow]], [[Edward Teller]], and Ulam. Soon, these three became members of a short-lived committee appointed by Bradbury to study the problem, with Teller as chairman.<ref name='VITA'/> At this time, research on the use of a fission weapon to create a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]] had been ongoing since 1942, but the design was still essentially the one originally proposed by Teller. His concept was to put [[tritium]] and/or [[deuterium]] in close proximity to a fission bomb, with the hope that the heat and intense flux of neutrons released when the bomb exploded, would ignite a self-sustaining [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reaction]]. Reactions of these [[isotopes of hydrogen]] are of interest because the energy per unit mass of fuel released by their fusion is much larger than that from fission of heavy nuclei.<ref name=\"RHODES\"/>\n\n[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Ivy Mike]], the first full test of the Teller\u2013Ulam design (a [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged]] fusion bomb), with a [[TNT equivalent|yield]] of 10.4 megatons on 1 November 1952|alt=A mushroom cloud lights up the dawn sky]]\nBecause the results of calculations based on Teller's concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it [[History of the Teller\u2013Ulam design#Teller's \"Super\"|could not lead to a successful weapon]], while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding. Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer.<ref name= \"HEWLETT AND DUNCAN\"/> To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller's approach was feasible. To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, [[MANIAC I|MANIAC]], at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos. Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition. [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam|Fran\u00e7oise Ulam]] was one of a cadre of women \"[[Human computers#Wartime computing and the invention of electronic computing|computers]]\" who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on [[mechanical calculator]]s, supplemented and confirmed by Everett's [[slide rule]]. Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios. The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in [[combinatorics]] to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was much more complicated than the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering.<ref name='GALISON'/> In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann's results.<ref name='FULAM'/><ref name=\"RHODES 422-424\"/>\n\nIn January 1951, Ulam had another idea: to channel the mechanical shock of a nuclear explosion so as to compress the fusion fuel. On the recommendation of his wife,<ref name='FULAM'/> Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it.<ref name='MARKBIO'/> Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft [[X-rays]] from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect. On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations.<ref name='LAMS1225'/> A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a [[fissile]] rod or cylinder at the center of the fusion fuel. The detonation of this \"spark plug\"<ref name='LAMS1230'/> would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction. The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often described as the \"[[Teller\u2013Ulam design]]\".<ref name=\"RHODES 455-464\"/>\n\n[[File:Ivy Mike Sausage device.jpg|thumb|The ''Sausage'' device of [[Ivy Mike|Mike]] nuclear test (yield 10.4 Mt) on [[Enewetak Atoll]]. The test was part of the [[Operation Ivy]]. The Sausage was the first true H-Bomb ever tested, meaning the first [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear]] device built upon the [[Teller\u2013Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] principles of staged radiation implosion.|alt=Tiny men and a large silver cylindrical object connected to a lot of scaffolding and tubes]]\nIn September 1951, after a series of differences with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago.<ref name=\"HEWLETT AND DUNCAN 554-556\"/> At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester.<ref name=\"ULAM 220-224\"/> Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design<ref name='LAMS1225'/> and jointly applied for a patent on it,<ref name='LANLBIO'/> they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit.<ref name='MARKBIO'/> After the war, Bethe returned to [[Cornell University]], but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant. In 1954, he wrote an article on the history of the H-bomb,<ref name='BETHE'/> which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough. This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam's role.<ref name = 'UCHII'/> \"After the H-bomb was made,\" Bethe recalled, \"reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the midwife.\"<ref name=SCHWEBER/>\n\nWith the basic fusion reactions confirmed, and with a feasible design in hand, there was nothing to prevent Los Alamos from testing a thermonuclear device. On 1 November 1952, the first thermonuclear explosion occurred when [[Ivy Mike]] was detonated on [[Enewetak Atoll]], within the US [[Pacific Proving Grounds]]. This device, which used liquid deuterium as its fusion fuel, was immense and utterly unusable as a weapon. Nevertheless, its success validated the Teller\u2013Ulam design, and stimulated intensive development of practical weapons.<ref name=\"ULAM 220-224\"/>\n\n===Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem===\n{{main|Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem}}\nWhen Ulam returned to Los Alamos, his attention turned away from weapon design and toward the use of computers to investigate problems in physics and mathematics. With [[John Pasta]], who helped Metropolis to bring MANIAC on line in March 1952, he explored these ideas in a report \"Heuristic Studies in Problems of Mathematical Physics on High Speed Computing Machines\", which was submitted on 9 June 1953. It treated several problems that cannot be addressed within the framework of traditional analytic methods: billowing of fluids, rotational motion in gravitating systems, magnetic lines of force, and hydrodynamic instabilities.<ref name='LA1557'/>\n\nSoon, Pasta and Ulam became experienced with electronic computation on MANIAC, and by this time, Enrico Fermi had settled into a routine of spending academic years at the University of Chicago and summers at Los Alamos. During these summer visits, Pasta, Ulam, and [[Mary Tsingou]], a programmer in the MANIAC group, joined him to study a variation of the classic problem of a string of masses held together by springs that exert forces linearly proportional to their displacement from equilibrium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dauxois|first1=Thierry|title=Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and a mysterious lady|journal=Physics Today|date=2008|volume=6|issue=1|pages=55\u201357|url=http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/thierry.dauxois/PAPERS/pt61_55.2008.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2017|doi=10.1063/1.2835154|arxiv=0801.1590|bibcode=2008PhT....61a..55D}}</ref> Fermi proposed to add to this force a nonlinear component, which could be chosen to be proportional to either the square or cube of the displacement, or to a more complicated \"broken linear\" function. This addition is the key element of the [[Fermi\u2013Pasta\u2013Ulam\u2013Tsingou problem]], which is often designated by the abbreviation FPUT.<ref name='LA1940'/><ref name='FPU'/>\n\nA classical spring system can be described in terms of vibrational modes, which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string. If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop. With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes. This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode.<ref name='FPU'/> This behavior is very different from the expected [[Equipartition theorem|equipartition of energy]]. It remained mysterious until 1965, when [[Martin David Kruskal|Kruskal]] and [[Norman Zabusky|Zabusky]] showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the system can be described by the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]], which is the prototype of nonlinear [[partial differential equations]] that have [[soliton]] solutions. This means that FPUT behavior can be understood in terms of solitons.<ref name=\"CHAOS\"/>\n\n===Nuclear propulsion===\n[[File:NASA-project-orion-artist.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An artist's conception of the NASA reference design for the Project Orion spacecraft powered by nuclear propulsion|alt=A painting of a spacecraft passing a Jupiter-like planet]]\nStarting in 1955, Ulam and [[Frederick Reines]] considered [[nuclear propulsion]] of aircraft and rockets.<ref name='LAMS2186'/> This is an attractive possibility, because the nuclear energy per unit mass of fuel is a million times greater than that available from chemicals. From 1955 to 1972, their ideas were pursued during [[Project Rover]], which explored the use of nuclear reactors to power rockets.<ref name=\"ULAM 249-254\"/> In response to a question by Senator [[John O. Pastore]] at a congressional committee hearing on \"Outer Space Propulsion by Nuclear Energy\", on January 22, 1958, Ulam replied that \"the future as a whole of mankind is to some extent involved inexorably now with going outside the globe.\"<ref name='HEARING'/>\n\nUlam and C. J. Everett also proposed, in contrast to [[Nuclear thermal rocket|Rover's continuous heating of rocket exhaust]], to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion.<ref name='LAMS1955'/> [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] was a study of this idea. It began in 1958 and ended in 1965, after the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and in space.<ref name='ORION'/> Work on this project was spearheaded by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]], who commented on the decision to end Orion in his article, \"Death of a Project\".<ref name='DEATH'/>\n\nBradbury appointed Ulam and [[John H. Manley]] as research advisors to the laboratory director in 1957. These newly created positions were on the same administrative level as division leaders, and Ulam held his until he retired from Los Alamos. In this capacity, he was able to influence and guide programs in many divisions: theoretical, physics, chemistry, metallurgy, weapons, health, Rover, and others.<ref name='ULAM 249-254'/>\n\nIn addition to these activities, Ulam continued to publish technical reports and research papers. One of these introduced the [[Fermi\u2013Ulam model]], an extension of Fermi's theory of [[Fermi acceleration|the acceleration of cosmic rays]].<ref name='FUM'/> Another, with Paul Stein and [[Mary Tsingou]], titled \"Quadratic Transformations\", was an early investigation of [[chaos theory]] and is considered the first published use of the phrase \"[[chaotic behavior]]\".<ref name='ABRAHAM' /><ref name='LA-2305'/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Return to academia==\n[[File:Ulam 1.png|thumb|300px|When the positive integers are arrayed along the [[Ulam spiral]], prime numbers, represented by dots, tend to collect along diagonal lines.|alt=A lot of dots, but forming diagonal lines]]\nDuring his years at Los Alamos, Ulam was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1951 to 1952, [[MIT]] from 1956 to 1957, the [[University of California, San Diego]], in 1963, and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] from 1961 to 1962 and 1965 to 1967. In 1967, the last of these positions became permanent, when Ulam was appointed as professor and Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at [[Boulder, Colorado]]. He kept a residence in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], which made it convenient to spend summers at Los Alamos as a consultant.<ref name=\"AIP\"/>\n\nIn Colorado, where he rejoined his friends Gamow, Richtmyer, and Hawkins, Ulam's research interests turned toward [[biology]]. In 1968, recognizing this emphasis, the [[University of Colorado Denver|University of Colorado School of Medicine]] appointed Ulam as Professor of Biomathematics, and he held this position until his death. With his Los Alamos colleague Robert Schrandt he published a report, \"Some Elementary Attempts at Numerical Modeling of Problems Concerning Rates of Evolutionary Processes\", which applied his earlier ideas on branching processes to biological inheritance.<ref name='LA-4246'/> Another, report, with William Beyer, [[Temple F. Smith]], and M. L. Stein, titled \"Metrics in Biology\", introduced new ideas about biometric distances.<ref name='LA-4973'/>\n\nWhen he retired from Colorado in 1975, Ulam had begun to spend winter semesters at the [[University of Florida]], where he was a graduate research professor. Except for [[sabbatical]]s at the [[University of California, Davis]] from 1982 to 1983, and at [[Rockefeller University]] from 1980 to 1984,<ref name=\"AIP\"/> this pattern of spending summers in Colorado and Los Alamos and winters in Florida continued until Ulam died of an apparent heart attack in Santa Fe on 13 May 1984.<ref name='NYTIMES-OBIT'/>\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] noted that \"he died suddenly of heart failure, without fear or pain, while he could still prove and conjecture.\"<ref name=\"ERDOS\"/> In 1987, [[Fran\u00e7oise Aron Ulam|Fran\u00e7oise Ulam]] deposited his papers with the [[American Philosophical Society]] Library in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"PAPERS\"/> She continued to live in Santa Fe until she died on 30 April 2011, at the age of 93. Both Fran\u00e7oise and her husband are buried with her French family in [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name='FULAMOBIT'/><ref name=RB/>\n\n==Challenge to economics==\nAlfred Marshall and his disciples dominated economic theory until the end of WW 2. With the Cold War, the theory changed emphasizing that market economy was superior and the only sensible way. In Paul Samuelson\u00b4s \u201cEconomics: An Introductory Analysis \u201d, 1948, Adam Smith\u00b4s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d was only a footnote. In later editions, it became the central theme. \n\nAs Samuelson <ref>The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul A. Samuelson, vol. iii, p. 683, MIT Press 1966 </ref> remembers all this was challenged by Stanislaw Ulam: \u201c[Y]ears ago \u2026 I was in the Society of Fellows at Harvard along with the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Ulam, who was to become an originator of the Monte Carlo method and co-discoverer of the hydrogen-bomb, \u2026 used to tease me by saying, \u2018Name me one proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and non-trivial.\u2019 This was the test that I always failed. But now, some thirty years later \u2026 an appropriate answer occurs to me: The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage \u2026 . That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that it is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them.\"\n\n==Impact and legacy==\nFrom the publication of his first paper as a student in 1929 until his death, Ulam was constantly writing on mathematics. The list of Ulam's publications includes more than 150 papers.<ref name='AJMAA'/> Topics represented by a significant number of papers are: [[set theory]] (including [[measurable cardinal]]s and abstract [[measure (mathematics)|measures]]), [[topology]], [[Transformation (function)|transformation theory]], [[ergodic theory]], [[group theory]], [[Variety (universal algebra)|projective algebra]], [[number theory]], [[combinatorics]], and [[graph theory]].<ref name='UPUBS'/> In March 2009, the [[Mathematical Reviews]] database contained 697 papers with the name \"Ulam\".<ref name='UAMS'/>\n\nNotable results of this work are:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem]]\n*[[Mazur\u2013Ulam theorem]]\n*[[Kuratowski\u2013Ulam theorem]]\n*[[Hyers\u2013Ulam\u2013Rassias stability]]\n*[[Lucky number]]\n*[[Ulam spiral]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Collatz conjecture|Ulam conjecture]] (in Number Theory)\n*[[Reconstruction conjecture|Ulam conjecture]] (in Graph theory)\n*[[Ulam's packing conjecture]]\n*[[Ulam's game]]\n*[[Ulam matrix]]\n*[[Ulam numbers]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nWith his pivotal role in the development of thermonuclear weapons, Stanislaw Ulam changed the world. According to Fran\u00e7oise Ulam: \"Stan would reassure me that, barring accidents, the H-bomb rendered nuclear war impossible.\"<ref name=FULAM/> In 1980, Ulam and his wife appeared in the television documentary ''[[The Day After Trinity]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0080594|title=The Day After Trinity}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LuckySieve.gif|thumb|An animation demonstrating the lucky number sieve.

In his [[Lilienfeld Prize]] lecture, [[David K. Campbell]] noted this relationship and described how FPUT gave rise to ideas in [[Chaos theory|chaos]], [[solitons]], and [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]].<ref name='CAMPB'/> In 1980, [[Donald Kerr]], laboratory director at Los Alamos, with the strong support of Ulam and [[Mark Kac]],<ref name = 'CNLSSCOTT'/> founded the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS).<ref name='CNLSHIST'/> In 1985, CNLS initiated the ''Stanislaw M. Ulam Distinguished Scholar'' program, which provides an annual award that enables a noted scientist to spend a year carrying out research at Los Alamos.<ref name='CNLSULAM'/>\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the original FPUT paper was the subject of the March 2005 issue of the journal Chaos,<ref name='FPUCHAOS'/> and the topic of the 25th Annual International Conference of CNLS.<ref name='CNLSFPU'/> The [[University of Southern Mississippi]] and the University of Florida supported the ''Ulam Quarterly'',<ref name='UQUART'/> which was active from 1992 to 1996, and which was one of the first online mathematical journals.<ref name='UQUART2'/> Florida's Department of Mathematics has sponsored, since 1998, the annual ''Ulam Colloquium Lecture'',<ref name='UCOLLOQ'/> and in March 2009, the ''Ulam Centennial Conference''.<ref name='UCONF'/>\n\nUlam's work on non-[[Euclidean distance|Euclidean distance metrics]] in the context of molecular biology made a significant contribution to [[sequence analysis]]<ref name='GOAD'/> and his contributions in theoretical biology are considered watersheds in the development of [[Cellular automata#History|cellular automata]] theory, [[population biology]], [[pattern recognition]], and biometrics generally (David Sankoff, however, challenged conclusions of Walter by writing that Ulam had only modest influence on early development of sequence alignment methods.<ref name='SANKOFF' />). Colleagues noted that some of his greatest contributions were in clearly identifying problems to be solved and general techniques for solving them.<ref name='BIOLOGY'/> \n\nIn 1987, Los Alamos issued a special issue of its ''Science'' publication, which summarized his accomplishments,<ref name='UTRIB'/> and which appeared, in 1989, as the book ''From Cardinals to Chaos''. Similarly, in 1990, the University of California Press issued a compilation of mathematical reports by Ulam and his Los Alamos collaborators: ''Analogies Between Analogies''.<ref name='ANALOG'/> During his career, Ulam was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]], [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]], and [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]].<ref name='VITA'/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |last=Kac |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Kac |first2=Stanis\u0142aw |last2=Ulam |title=Mathematics and Logic: Retrospect and Prospects |url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicslogic0000kacm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Praeger |year=1968 |isbn= 978-0-486-67085-0 |oclc=24847821 }}\n*{{cite book|mr=0441664|last=Ulam|first= Stanis\u0142aw |title=Sets, Numbers, and Universes: selected works|editor1-first= W.

Based in [[Old Deer Park]], [[Richmond-upon-Thames]], London Welsh RFC played in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] in the [[2012\u201313 English Premiership (rugby union)|2012\u201313]] and [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315]] seasons, after gaining promotion from the [[RFU Championship]] in the 2012 and 2014 play-off final. The club returned to Old Deer Park in 2015 after three seasons at the [[Kassam Stadium]], [[Oxford]].\n\nThe club went into liquidation in December 2016 under Chairman Bleddyn Phillips, and was given a temporary licence to complete two fixtures in the Championship. On 24 January 2017 it was announced that London Welsh had been removed from the [[2016\u201317 RFU Championship|RFU Championship]] and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\".<ref name=londonwelshliquidation2>{{cite web|title=London Welsh: RFU refuses permission for Exiles to stay in Championship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/38736486|website=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2017}}</ref>  The remnants of the defunct club were amalgamated into [[London Welsh Amateur|their amateur set up]].\n\n==Affiliated teams==\nDuring professionalism, London Welsh's first-XV squad were fully professional, and they were complemented with the London Welsh Amateurs, Druids and Occies. Following the changes at the club in the 2016/17 season the club operates the 1st XV and Druids 2nd XV that form the performance playing squad, the Occies 3rd XV and the Under 23s Griffins player pathway.{{www.londonwelshrfc.com|date=January 2019}}\n\nLondon Welsh has one of the longest-standing women's sides \u2013 LWWRFC \u2013 which celebrated thirty years of women's rugby at the club in the 2015\u201316 season. While still being amateur, the club has succeeded both in XVs in the winter and 7s during the summer as well as players representing England at the regional level and on the Wales national touch team. There is also a mini and junior section.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nLondon Welsh was formed in 1885 by and for London's [[Wales|Welsh]] community, and has played senior-level rugby since then.<ref name=\"Jones3\">Jones (1985), pg 3.</ref> Its name in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], is ''Clwb Rygbi Cymry Llundain''.\n\n===Players who have won international and Lions caps===\nOver the years the club has contributed 177 players to the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales national team]] and 43 players to the [[British and Irish Lions]].

[[John Dawes]] was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards. One 1968-69 performance was described by journalist John Reason<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10425614</ref><ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/brendangallagher/2307779/About-Rugby-Special-tribute-to-John-Reason.html</ref> as \"one of the most brilliant exhibitions of club football it has been my privilege to see,\" and by journalist Terry O'Connor<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/3015852/Talking-Rugby-Union-Game-enriched-by-competitive-line-out.html</ref> as \"the finest display by a club team I can remember', further describing London Welsh 'switching attacks with speed and handling skill.' <ref>The Man Who Changed the World of Rugby - John Dawes and the Legendary 1971 British Lions, Ross Reyburn </ref><ref>https://www.therugbyjournal.com/rugby-blog/john-dawes</ref>\n\n===2006-9===\nIn December 2006, London Welsh revealed their ambition to leave the English league and become the fifth Welsh team in the [[Pro14|Celtic League]].

The team was also defeated in every single European Challenge Cup game, as well as every single Anglo-Welsh cup game. As a result, they became the first top-flight English side for over 10 years to suffer defeat in every single competitive match over a season.\n\n===2015\u2013present: return to Richmond and liquidation===\nThe club left Oxford and returned to Old Deer Park at the end of the [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315 season]].

London Welsh announced a five-year plan in May 2017 to get the club back into the national leagues by being promoted 4 times, bringing in ex-player Sonny Parker as Director of Rugby. Parker left after one season, and Cai Griffiths took over as Head Coach, along with Will Taylor, James Collins-Clarke, Pete Lowe and Tom May.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Honours==\n* [[Middlesex Sevens]] winners (8 times): 1930, 1931, 1956, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1984\n* [[Hawick Sevens]]\n** Champions (1): 1969<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scottishsevens.sport.blog/hawick-sevens/|title=Hawick Sevens|date=7 June 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Anglo-Welsh Cup|John Player Cup]] runner-up [[1984\u201385 John Player Cup|1985]]\n* [[Courage League Division 5|Courage League Division 5 South]] champions: 1994\u201395<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshirerugby.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid=455|title=Hampshire Rugby|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>\n* [[RFU Championship]] champions (2 times): [[2011\u201312 RFU Championship|2011\u201312]], [[2013\u201314 RFU Championship|2013\u201314]]\n* [[British and Irish Cup]] winners [[2015\u201316 British and Irish Cup|2015\u201316]]\n\n;Merit Table Rugby\nSunday Telegraph Pennants\n* English-Welsh champions 1967\u201368, 1970\u201371\nrunner-up 1965\u201366\nthird 1971\u201372<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dragon in Exile, The Centenary History of London Welsh R.F.C, Stephen Jones and Paul Beken, Springwood Books, London, 1985</ref>\n\n* English champions 1966\u201367, 1967\u201368, 1968\u201369, 1970\u201371, 1977\u201378, 1978\u201379, \nrunner-up 1965\u201366, 1971\u201372\nthird 1972\u201373<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n* Welsh champions 1970\u201371, 1971\u201372\nthird 1965\u201366<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHerts & Middlesex 1 Champions 2017/18 season \n\nLondon 3 NW Champions 2018/19 Season \n\nWestern Mail \n* Welsh Championship champions 1972\u201373\nrunner-up 1967\u201368, 1971\u201372<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nDaily Mail\n* Anglo-Welsh third 1978\u201379<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWhitbread\n* Welsh Merit Table champions 1971\u201372<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n;Promotions\n* National Division 4 \u2013 runner-up, 1995\u20136 (fourth tier of English rugby) <ref>[http://www.rugbyarchive.net/Pagine/PaginaCompetizioni.aspx?ID=24&Stagione=1995/96 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903133415/http://www.rugbyarchive.net/Pagine/PaginaCompetizioni.aspx?ID=24&Stagione=1995%2F96 |date=3 September 2014 }}</ref>\n* Jewson National League 1 \u2013 3rd, 1997\u201398 (third tier of English rugby)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moseleyrugby.co.uk/report_display12.php?menitem=104|title=Reports Display Page|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>\n* Lowest league position 6th 1993\u20134 Courage League Division 5 South (5th tier)<ref>[http://www.rugbyarchive.net/Pagine/PaginaCompetizioni.aspx?ID=24&Stagione=1993/94 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520095021/http://www.rugbyarchive.net/Pagine/PaginaCompetizioni.aspx?ID=24&Stagione=1993%2F94 |date=20 May 2014 }}</ref>\n* Highest league position 12th Aviva Premiership 2012\u201313 (1st tier) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyarchive.net/Pagine/Squadre.aspx?ID=163 |title=The history of rugby through its competitions |website=Rugbyarchive.net |date= |accessdate=2017-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==Notable former players==\n\n===British and Irish Lions===\nThe following former players were selected for the [[British and Irish Lions]] touring squads while playing for London Welsh.\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Robert Ackerman (rugby)|Robert Ackerman]] 1983\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Gerald Davies]] 1971\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Mervyn Davies]] 1971\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[John Dawes]] 1971\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Geoff Evans (rugby union born 1942)|Geoff Evans]] 1971\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Vivian Jenkins]] 1938\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Tommy Jones-Davies]] 1930\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Alun Lewis (rugby player)|Alun Lewis]] 1977\n|width=\"45\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Douglas Marsden-Jones]] 1924\n* {{flagicon|Wales}} [[Teddy Morgan]] 1904\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Billy Raybould]] 1968\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Clive Rees]] 1974\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[Mike Roberts (Welsh rugby player)|Mike Roberts]] 1971\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[John Taylor (rugby player)|John Taylor]] 1968,1971\n* {{Flagicon|Wales}} [[J.
