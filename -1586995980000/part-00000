It has much of Kazakhstan's [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Shore]]. It also borders neighboring countries [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. Mangystau also borders two other Kazakh regions (counter-clockwise), [[Aktobe Region]] and [[Atyrau Region]]. The area of the region is 165,600 square kilometers. Engineers discovered petroleum in the area in the days of the [[Soviet Union]], drilling commenced, and much of the area was built up around the industry.\n\nThe territory of Mangystau includes lots of different landscapes and desert lands: Caspian lowland, plateaus (Usturt, Mangyshlak, Kendirli-Kayasan), mountains (Aktau, Karatau), cavities, desert, mountains and mountain ridges. That kind of landscape forms an original multigraded labyrinth, painted with green, yellow, pink and red sediment of loam. The highest point is Otpan mountain at {{convert|556|m}}. The lowest point is the [[Caspian Depression|bottom of Karagie cavity]], {{convert|132|m}} below sea level.\n\n== Climate ==\nThe region has a wide variety of climate conditions. North Mangystau is cold in winter due to the [[Ustyurt Plateau]], the location of the plateau being mainly above sea level. On the whole, the climate is continental with cold winters and mild summers. The average temperature is {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} in January and {{convert|+26|\u00b0C}} in July. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|150|mm}}.\n\n== History ==\nThe first written sources on Mangystau Region date back to the 9th century AD.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} According to Arabic geographers, it was uninhabited until the tenth century when groups opposing the Turkmen Oghuz settled and found sources of water and grassland. The mountain called Binkishlah (unidentified) would have marked the border between [[Khwarezm]] and the Khanate of the [[Khazars]]. These Turkmen were vassals of the Khazars, at the beginning of the thirteenth century when Yaqut al-Hamawi and Ibn al-Athir mention{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} the name of Mankashlagh. Ibn al-Athir tells of a Turkish principality with a medina with the same name as the territory that existed from the late eleventh century. In 1097 a struggle between Kutb al-Din Muhammad, Khwarezm governor of Seljuks and Tugrul Tehghin occurred. In 1127, [[Atsiz]] occupied the whole peninsula. During [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmshah]] rule, it was part of firstly [[Gorgan]] province, later [[Mazandaran Province]].\n\nIn 1221, the Mongols occupied it. It was later passed to successively [[Golden Horde]], [[Nogai Horde]], [[Uzbek Khanate]] and [[Kazakh Khanate]], but its population  decreased after gradual drying of the steppe and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] raids began in 1620. Some Salur and Ersari Turkmens left the region and migrated to Russia.\n\nIn 1670, Anusha Khan who was the khan of Khiva asked the Russian government to build a fortress to protect the peninsula for securing trade between Russia and Khwarezm. Puntsuk Monchak and Ayuka (1670-1724) deported most of the Cawdor and Igdir groups of Turkmenistan to the Volga basin. For protecting trade, Anusha Khan annexed it to his territories in 1676 and built a fort at the port of Karagan in 1687.\n\nThe Russians under Peter the Great sent an expedition led by the unfortunate [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky|Bekovich-Cherkassky]], who established three forts on the coast of the Caspian Sea, but they were abandoned after one year. Then there were several Russian scientific expeditions. In 1834 they founded on the south coast of the Bay of Mertviy Kultuk a permanent garrison at Novo-Petrovskoye. This caused a conflict with the Khan of Khiva and an abortive military campaign between 1839 and 1840. During this period, the Bayuli tribe of the Kazakhs settled and the remaining Turkmens left it in 1840 except a group of families of the Cawdor tribe.\n\nThe peninsula was subject to conflict between Khiva and Russia; each party wanted to have the Kazakhs. In 1846, the Russians built a fort in Karagan named Novo-Petrovskoye that in 1859 was renamed Fort Alexandrovskiy. Russian domination of it began with the occupation of [[Krasnovodsk]], located in the southern part of it in 1869. At the same time, Russians established Mangyshlak district which was subordinated to the Viceroyality of Caucasus. The Khanate of Khiva renounced possession of this peninsula in favor of the Russians in 1873. It was attached to Russia as an uyezd of [[Transcaspian Oblast]] in 1881.\n\nThe fate of the government following the 1917 revolution was in the hands of the Mensheviks. After the [[October Revolution]] the Bolsheviks prevailed but were eliminated by British intervention in June 1918. In July 12, 1918 an Interim Executive Committee, which sought to restore [[Alexander Kerensky]], was established in [[Ashgabat]]. Bolsheviks took the region in February 1920. On August 26, 1920 the peninsula was included in the Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Russian Soviet Socialist Federative Republic. On June 15, 1925 it was renamed the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, all within the Russian RFSS. On December 5, 1936 it was elevated to Kazakh SSR. But a narrow strip of the southern coastal bay fronting Kara Boghaz was ceded to [[Turkmen SSR]] at the same time.\n\nIn 1937, this peninsula became  part of [[West Kazakhstan Region]] with the Kazakh part of [[Ustyurt Plateau]], and a new department{{what|date=March 2017}} was formed with its capital Fort-Shevchenko.{{fact|date=March 2017}} Its current capital was founded as Shevchenko in 1964.{{fact|date=March 2017}} After the independence of Kazakhstan, the region and its capital were renamed.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe region is administratively divided into five districts and two cities of regional significance: [[Aktau]] and [[Zhanaozen]].

It has much of Kazakhstan's [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Shore]]. It also borders neighboring countries [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. Mangystau also borders two other Kazakh regions (counter-clockwise), [[Aktobe Region]] and [[Atyrau Region]]. The area of the region is 165,600 square kilometers. Engineers discovered petroleum in the area in the days of the [[Soviet Union]], drilling commenced, and much of the area was built up around the industry.\n\nThe territory of Mangystau includes lots of different landscapes and desert lands: Caspian lowland, plateaus (Usturt, Mangyshlak, Kendirli-Kayasan), mountains (Aktau, Karatau), cavities, desert, mountains and mountain ridges. That kind of landscape forms an original multigraded labyrinth, painted with green, yellow, pink and red sediment of loam. The highest point is Otpan mountain at {{convert|556|m}}. The lowest point is the [[Caspian Depression|bottom of Karagie cavity]], {{convert|132|m}} below sea level.\n\n== Climate ==\nThe region has a wide variety of climate conditions. North Mangystau is cold in winter due to the [[Ustyurt Plateau]], the location of the plateau being mainly above sea level. On the whole, the climate is continental with cold winters and mild summers. The average temperature is {{convert|-3|\u00b0C}} in January and {{convert|+26|\u00b0C}} in July. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|150|mm}}.\n\n== History ==\nThe first written sources on Mangystau Region date back to the 9th century AD.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} According to Arabic geographers, it was uninhabited until the tenth century when groups opposing the Turkmen Oghuz settled and found sources of water and grassland. The mountain called Binkishlah (unidentified) would have marked the border between [[Khwarezm]] and the Khanate of the [[Khazars]]. These Turkmen were vassals of the Khazars, at the beginning of the thirteenth century when Yaqut al-Hamawi and Ibn al-Athir mention{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} the name of Mankashlagh. Ibn al-Athir tells of a Turkish principality with a medina with the same name as the territory that existed from the late eleventh century. In 1097 a struggle between Kutb al-Din Muhammad, Khwarezm governor of Seljuks and Tugrul Tehghin occurred. In 1127, [[Atsiz]] occupied the whole peninsula. During [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmshah]] rule, it was part of firstly [[Gorgan]] province, later [[Mazandaran Province]].\n\nIn 1221, the Mongols occupied it. It was later passed to successively [[Golden Horde]], [[Nogai Horde]], [[Uzbek Khanate]] and [[Kazakh Khanate]], but its population  decreased after gradual drying of the steppe and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] raids began in 1620. Some Salur and Ersari Turkmens left the region and migrated to Russia.\n\nIn 1670, Anusha Khan who was the khan of Khiva asked the Russian government to build a fortress to protect the peninsula for securing trade between Russia and Khwarezm. Puntsuk Monchak and Ayuka (1670-1724) deported most of the Cawdor and Igdir groups of Turkmenistan to the Volga basin. For protecting trade, Anusha Khan annexed it to his territories in 1676 and built a fort at the port of Karagan in 1687.\n\nThe Russians under Peter the Great sent an expedition led by the unfortunate [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky|Bekovich-Cherkassky]], who established three forts on the coast of the Caspian Sea, but they were abandoned after one year. Then there were several Russian scientific expeditions. In 1834 they founded on the south coast of the Bay of Mertviy Kultuk a permanent garrison at Novo-Petrovskoye. This caused a conflict with the Khan of Khiva and an abortive military campaign between 1839 and 1840. During this period, the Bayuli tribe of the Kazakhs settled and the remaining Turkmens left it in 1840 except a group of families of the Cawdor tribe.\n\nThe peninsula was subject to conflict between Khiva and Russia; each party wanted to have the Kazakhs. In 1846, the Russians built a fort in Karagan named Novo-Petrovskoye that in 1859 was renamed Fort Alexandrovskiy. Russian domination of it began with the occupation of [[Krasnovodsk]], located in the southern part of it in 1869. At the same time, Russians established Mangyshlak district which was subordinated to the Viceroyality of Caucasus. The Khanate of Khiva renounced possession of this peninsula in favor of the Russians in 1873. It was attached to Russia as an uyezd of [[Transcaspian Oblast]] in 1881.\n\nThe fate of the government following the 1917 revolution was in the hands of the Mensheviks. After the [[October Revolution]] the Bolsheviks prevailed but were eliminated by British intervention in June 1918. In July 12, 1918 an Interim Executive Committee, which sought to restore [[Alexander Kerensky]], was established in [[Ashgabat]]. Bolsheviks took the region in February 1920. On August 26, 1920 the peninsula was included in the Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Russian Soviet Socialist Federative Republic. On June 15, 1925 it was renamed the Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, all within the Russian RFSS. On December 5, 1936 it was elevated to Kazakh SSR.

The GENESIS organizer decided to give the top 64 players a free pass for the first day, giving them a pass on Round 1 pools. Instead, many of the top 64 players participated in the Smash Draft crew battles, featuring eight top players as captains and then drafting players. Mango was drafted by Scar, along with Alex19, Samus player Duck, and Fox player Colbol. The team faced Team PewPewU in the first round and lost in convincing fashion. The crew battle was won by Team Hungrybox. In Doubles, Mango failed to show up with his partner S2J, so the duo was immediately disqualified from the tournament. In Round 2 Singles, he beat Falco player Rula and Fox player Phil to easily make top 64. In top 64, he beat Luigi player Abate 3-1 and HugS 3\u20130, heading into the final round of Winners' against Axe.

Mango lost to Westballz 1-3 and was sent to Losers' to face Silent Wolf. After a 3-1 set victory, Mango proceeded to defeat Plup 3-1 and Wobbles 3-1 to face Armada in Losers' Finals. In a close 3-2 set, Mango edged out Armada on a last hit situation to move on to Grand Finals against Hungrybox. Mango cleanly beat Hungrybox 3\u20130 in the first set of Grand Finals, but then Hungrybox brought it back the second set 1\u20133, netting Mango another 2nd-place victory.\n\nMango also attended Pound 6 (April 2\u20133), where he ended up in Winners' Bracket for top 8.

In a very close set, Armada barely clutched it out 3-2 over Mango, giving Mango a 2nd-place finish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.teamliquid.net/smash/Smash_Summit/Singles_Bracket|title=Smash Summit/Singles Bracket - Liquipedia Smash Wiki|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn October 9, 2015, Armada announced that Mango will be attending DreamHack Winter 2015 in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden]] through Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ArmadaUGS/status/652644346328694784|title=Adam Lindgren on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> After winning his pools, he went on to beat RashAttack, Mike Haggar, Young Thug, and HugS to move on to Winners' Quarterfinals. In a close set against Plup, Mango lost 2\u20133, sending him to Losers'. Mango beat Shroomed 3\u20130, but was upset by Westballz 0\u20133 in Losers' Quarterfinals, giving him another 5th-place finish, tied with Samus player Duck. The tournament was won by Hungrybox, who lost to Armada 0\u20133 in the first set of Grand Finals, but beat him 3\u20131 in the second set.\n\nIn the final 2015 Rankings, Mango was ranked 4th, his lowest placing since MIOM started the SSBMRank, by a group of 43 professional players and active people in the Smash scene. Armada, Hungrybox, and Leffen placed ahead of him, while he placed ahead of Mew2King, and PPMD.<ref name=\"meleeitonme.com\"/>\n\n===2016 and 2017===\nThe first national of the year, [[Genesis (tournament)#GENESIS 3|GENESIS 3]], in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], had 1,836 entrants, including Mango. The GENESIS organizer decided to give the top 64 players a free pass for the first day, giving them a pass on Round 1 pools. Instead, many of the top 64 players participated in the Smash Draft crew battles, featuring eight top players as captains and then drafting players. Mango was drafted by Scar, along with Alex19, Samus player Duck, and Fox player Colbol. The team faced Team PewPewU in the first round and lost in convincing fashion. The crew battle was won by Team Hungrybox. In Doubles, Mango failed to show up with his partner S2J, so the duo was immediately disqualified from the tournament. In Round 2 Singles, he beat Falco player Rula and Fox player Phil to easily make top 64. In top 64, he beat Luigi player Abate 3-1 and HugS 3\u20130, heading into the final round of Winners' against Axe. There, however, he lost to the Pikachu player 1\u20133, sending Axe to top 8 Winners' side and sending Mango to Losers'. He beat Plup in the final round of Losers', giving him a top 8 spot. The next day in Losers' Top 8, Mango switched to Fox from Falco and he overwhelmed Ice Climbers player Nintendude and beat him 3-0 and then beat PPMD 3\u20130 in Losers' Quarterfinals. In Losers' Semifinals, Mango was in a rematch against Axe and ended in an Axe flub and a 3-0 Mango victory. In Losers' Finals, Mango took out Hungrybox 3-2 and the Grand Finals pitted the same matchup as it did in the other GENESIS tournaments: Armada versus Mango. In the first two games, Mango's Fox convincingly beat Armada's Fox, forcing Armada to go Peach. Mango then got the Bracket reset 3\u20131, but lost the second set 1\u20133, giving Armada the GENESIS 3 victory.\n\nMango then signed up for PAX Arena in [[San Antonio, Texas.|San Antonio]], [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smash.gg/tournament/pax-arena/attendees|title=PAX Arena|publisher=}}</ref> Mango defeated Mexican Fox player Valdo 3-0 and Wizzrobe, the up-and-coming Captain Falcon player, 3\u20131. In Winners' Semifinals, he beat Mew2King's Marth 3\u20131 with Falco, but lost to Hungrybox in Winners' Finals 2\u20133 with his Fox. He beat Westballz 3\u20131 in Losers' Finals but fell short to Hungrybox again in Grand Finals, 2\u20133.\n\nMango was invited to SXSW's Battle of the Five Gods, which featured twenty players: Mango, Armada, Mew2King, PPMD, Hungrybox, MacD, Ice, Silent Wolf, DruggedFox, HugS, Westballz, Nintendude, Plup, SFAT, PewPewU, Shroomed, Axe, Lucky, Wobbles, and S2J. He was placed on the top of his group in the Round Robin; the group also consisted of Axe, considered the world's best Pikachu player, who has defeated Mango twice at MVG Sandstorm, 2\u20133, and GENESIS 3,1-2; MacD, the second best Peach player who has beaten Mango once, 1\u20132, at HTC Throwdown; and DruggedFox, Georgia's best player who also beat Mango also at HTC Throwdown, 1\u20132. Mango beat all three players in his pool, 3\u20132, 3\u20130, and 3\u20130, respectively, to move on to the playoffs group to face Westballz. Mango lost to Westballz 1-3 and was sent to Losers' to face Silent Wolf. After a 3-1 set victory, Mango proceeded to defeat Plup 3-1 and Wobbles 3-1 to face Armada in Losers' Finals. In a close 3-2 set, Mango edged out Armada on a last hit situation to move on to Grand Finals against Hungrybox. Mango cleanly beat Hungrybox 3\u20130 in the first set of Grand Finals, but then Hungrybox brought it back the second set 1\u20133, netting Mango another 2nd-place victory.\n\nMango also attended Pound 6 (April 2\u20133), where he ended up in Winners' Bracket for top 8. He lost to Hax$ in Winners' Semifinals and was sent to the Losers' Bracket. He beat Plup in Losers' Quarterfinals 3-0 and beat Swedish Delight in Losers' Semifinals 3\u20132 in order to play Hax again in Losers' Finals. He beat Hax 3-0 and went to Grand Finals, finishing 2nd place after a 1\u20133 loss to Hungrybox in the first set of Grand Finals.\n\nMango was invited to Smash Summit 2, along with Armada, Hungrybox, Mew2King, Plup, Westballz, Axe, Shroomed, SFAT, Silent Wolf, ESAM, PewPewU, Ice, Duck, S2J, and Wobbles. In crew battles, Mango's team, which included Duck, Silent Wolf, and S2J, defeated Team Hungrybox but lost to Team Armada and then to Team Hungrybox in Losers' to net a 3rd-place finish. In the Iron Man competition, Mango defeated Shroomed 20-19 and Mew2King 20-18 to face Armada in Grand Finals. Mango was first down, but then used his Mario to take 5 stocks from Armada, winning the Iron Man 20\u201319. In Doubles, with S2J, the duo beat Shroomed and Westballz 3-1 and upset Hungrybox and Plup 3-2 to move into Winners' Finals. They lost a close 2-3 to Mew2King and Armada, who would end up winning Doubles, and then lost to Hungrybox and Plup 0\u20133 in Losers' Finals. In Singles, he edged out Duck 1\u20133 in the round of 16 and barely beat Westballz 3-2 to move on to Winners' Semifinals. There, in a last hit, last stock situation, he was on the verge of defeating Hungrybox but failed to convert a kill, losing 2\u20133, sending him to Losers'. Mango defeated Plup 3-2 after a long combo to end the set but lost to Armada 0\u20133, placing 4th at the tournament.\n\nMango attended [[Big House 6]], a fall national held annually in Michigan. He won 1st place after advancing to Grand Finals on the winning side, and reset the Bracket to defeat Armada in Game 5 of the second set. Mango also won Royal Flush, a major tournament held in Atlantic City in May 2017, ending Armada's dominant streak which began at the end of 2017 and winning his fourth consecutive tournament held on [[Mother's Day]] weekend.\n\n==Personal life==\nMarquez is of [[Costa Rican people|Costa Rican]] descent.<ref name=twitch/> He graduated from [[John Glenn High School (California)|John Glenn High School]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johnglennhighschool.net/norwalk-ca/alumni-list-m.html|title=John Glenn HS Norwalk, CA Alumni List - Last Names starting with M|website=John Glenn High School Norwalk, CA|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> He and his girlfriend Lauren have one son, Joseph Mango Marquez, born October 14, 2013, whose middle name comes from the older Marquez's ''Melee'' handle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meleeiton.me/theteam/|title=THE TEAM|website=Melee it on Me|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref> Marquez says that his involvement in gaming kept him out of [[gangs]].

It is a [[nitrogen]]-dependent plant and thus is generally found near places of [[organic waste]] disposal. Elders are often grown as a [[hedgerow]] plant in Britain since they take very fast, can be bent into shape easily and grow quite profusely, thus having gained the reputation of being 'an instant hedge'. It is not generally affected by soil type or pH level and will virtually grow anywhere sufficient [[sunlight]] is available.\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nIn Northern California, elderberries are a food for migrating [[band-tailed pigeon]]s. Elders are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[brown-tail]], [[buff ermine]], [[dot moth]], [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[Engrailed (moth)|engrailed moth]], [[swallow-tailed moth]] and the [[V-pug]]. The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong fetid smell. [[Valley elderberry longhorn beetle]]s in California are very often found around red or blue elderberry bushes.

It is a [[nitrogen]]-dependent plant and thus is generally found near places of [[organic waste]] disposal. Elders are often grown as a [[hedgerow]] plant in Britain since they take very fast, can be bent into shape easily and grow quite profusely, thus having gained the reputation of being 'an instant hedge'. It is not generally affected by soil type or pH level and will virtually grow anywhere sufficient [[sunlight]] is available.\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nIn Northern California, elderberries are a food for migrating [[band-tailed pigeon]]s. Elders are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including [[brown-tail]], [[buff ermine]], [[dot moth]], [[Pavonia pavonia|emperor moth]], [[Engrailed (moth)|engrailed moth]], [[swallow-tailed moth]] and the [[V-pug]]. The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong fetid smell. [[Valley elderberry longhorn beetle]]s in California are very often found around red or blue elderberry bushes. Females lay their eggs on the bark.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The [[pith]] of elder has been used by [[watchmaking|watchmakers]] for cleaning tools before intricate work.<ref>[http://www.oldandsold.com/articles22/watch-repair-2.shtml Materials used in construction and repair of watches]</ref>\n\n== Cultivation ==\n\nTraditional uses of ''Sambucus'' involved berries, seeds, leaves, and flowers or component [[extract]]s.<ref name=\"abc\">{{cite web |author1=Gayle Engels |author2=Josef Brinckmann |title=European elder, ''Sambucus nigra'', L. |url=http://cms.herbalgram.org/herbalgram/issue97/hg97-herbpro.html |publisher=HerbalGram, American Botanical Council |accessdate=21 October 2019 |date=2013}}</ref> [[ornamental plant|Ornamental]] varieties of ''Sambucus'' are grown in gardens for their showy flowers, fruits and lacy foliage which support habitat for wildlife.<ref name=\"stevens\">{{cite web |author1=Stevens M |title=Guide for common elderberry (''Sambucus nigra'' L. ssp.

Their [[endangerment]] arose as a result of various intertribal wars and massacres in the 30s and 40s as well as [[measles]] outbreaks, leaving them with only 50 Mamaind\u00ea members by 1965 according to SIL workers Peter and Shirley Kingston.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Cahill|first=M|date=2004|title=From Endangered to Less Endangered: Case Histories from Brazil and Papua New Guinea|url=https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/13/69/27/136927567288892881618167976727162966022/silewp2004_004.pdf|journal=SIL Electronic Working Papers (Revised Edition)|volume=|pages=4\u20135|via=}}</ref> Their population began to rebuild in the 90s, according to SIL workers Dave and Julie Eberhard, when they traced a steady increase in population size and found that their community had grown to 136 members by 1999<ref name=\":13\" />.\n\nTraditionally located in the Cabixi river region, the Mamaind\u00ea people belong to the Nambikwara language family. This language family was extensively studied by American [[Anthropologist]] and [[Ethnologist]], David Price, who describes the discovery of gold in the Coxipo river in 1719 as the root for the initial presence of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and other non-indigenous people in the Mato Grosso region. Being a variety of Northern Nambikwara, the Mamaind\u00ea indigenous group, specifically, only came into contact with Brazilian society about three generations ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Annoy, S. and Eberhard, D.|date=2008|title=A Survey of Three Northern Nambiquara Groups: The Mamaind\u00ea, Negarote, and Latunde|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237443290|journal=SIL Electronic Survey Report|volume=I|pages=3|via=}}</ref> It wasn\u2019t until 1911 that the Portuguese actually starting to settle in the Nambikwara area, following the spread of the [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph line]] throughout Brazil.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Anonby, S. and Eberhard, D.|date=2008|title=A Survey of Three Northern Nambiquara Groups: The Mamaind\u00ea, Negarote, and Latunde.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237443290|journal=SIL Electronic Survey Report|volume=I|pages=6|via=}}</ref> Though contact between the indigenous and non-indigenous was both violent and peaceful, measles and massacres ultimately began to exterminate most Nambiwaran tribes. This [[genocide]], which occurred in a span of 30 years, paved the way for the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the survivors to local Brazilian populations (especially after losing their land), and eventually led to the creation of [[pidgin]]s/[[dialect]]s between their indigenous languages and Portuguese.\n\nWith a strenuous process, the Mamaind\u00ea were one of the few tribes able to regain \u201clegal title of their land\u201d<ref name=\":14\" />. Being initially given a heavily impoverished reserve in 1961, survival was especially wearisome. They decided to walk back to their original land anticipating better living conditions, though lost 30% of their already decaying population on their 400km journey<ref name=\":14\" />. In times of desperation and in hopes of giving their offspring a better chance of survival, Mamaind\u00ea mothers would even travel to the [[Cuiab\u00e1|Cuiaba]]-[[Porto Velho]] highway to give babies away to truck drivers and passerby\u2019s.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Anonby, S. and Eberhard, D.|date=2008|title=A Survey of Three Northern Nambiquara Groups: The Mamaind\u00ea, Negarote, and Latunde|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237443290|journal=SIL Electronic Survey Report|volume=I|pages=7|via=}}</ref> During these arduous times when their population was down to 50 people and on the path to [[extinction]], [[SIL International]], a non-profit language development organization, became involved in their communities.

Pushing for sustainability and working towards community development, SIL was able to kick-start their advancement in preserving the Mamaind\u00ea culture, language and population.\n\n=== Language Family ===\nThe [[language family]] of which Mamaind\u00ea belongs to is Nambikwara (also spelled Nambicuara or Nambiquara). Speakers of languages from this family have once or currently lived in the [[Chapada dos Parecis]], the Guapor\u00e9 Valley and the northern region between the [[Iqu\u00ea River|Iqu\u0207 River]] and the Cabixi and Piolho rivers<ref name=\":16\" />. \u00a0Nambikwara languages can be split into three divisions: Saban\u0207, Northern Nambikwara and Southern Nambikwara.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=D.|date=1978|title=The Nambikwara Linguistic Family|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=XX|issue=1|pages=14\u201337|jstor=30027610}}</ref> Languages within each division are [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2016|title=Evidentiality in Nambikwara Languages|url=|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>, given that they\u2019re considered dialects or variations. [[Multilingualism]] is common among Nambikwara that live in the north areas due to heavy contact with different Nambikwara languages as well as Portuguese.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Embodied Names: Construing Nambiquara Personhood Through Naming Practices|last=Fiorini|first=M.O.|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \u00a0As previously mentioned, according to David Price, contact between Portuguese speakers and speakers of Nambikwara languages initially occurred when Portuguese began travelling onto Nambikwara territory in search of gold<ref name=\":16\" />.\n<br />\n\n=== Work on Nambikwara ===\nDavid Price contributed greatly to research on the Nambikwara community and focused his [[Field research|fieldwork]] on them for his [[Thesis|doctoral dissertation]] in anthropology (1967-1970). He worked with/for \u201cthe government agency in charge indigenous people\u201d, FUNAI, to aid the Nambikwara community. In addition, Price wrote \u201cThe Nambiquara Linguistic Family\u201d which classified 6 of the family\u2019s languages<ref name=\":15\" />. \u00a0His contribution to the Nambikwara documentation didn\u2019t end there, as he also wrote the published article \u201cPareci, Cabixi, Nambikwara: a Case study in the Western classification of native peoples\u201d (Journal de la Societe des Americanistes. 69:129-48, 1983). The book that dives into each specific Nambikwara group and its history called \u201cBefore the Bulldozer\u201d, was also written by Price in 1989.\n\nNambikwara has various other linguistic literature available as well. \u00a0A [[Linguistic description|descriptive grammar]] can be found for Nambikwara; Menno Kroeker wrote the journal article \u201cA Descriptive Grammar of Nambikuara\u201d in 2001 which was published by The University of Chicago Press. This work includes information on the languages in the Nambikwara family in terms of Grammatical Clauses, Verbs, Nouns, Vowels, Phrases, Syllables, Adjectivals, Consonants, etc. \u00a0This texts generally explains the grammar on Nambikwara.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kroer|first=M.|date=2001|title=A Descriptive Grammar of Nambikuara|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=LXVII|issue=1|pages=1\u201387|jstor=1265810}}</ref> According to Klein and Stark in the book they edited titled \u201cSouth American Indian Languages: Retrospect and Prospect\u201d, Nambikwara also has phonological descriptions and a [[pedagogical grammar]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Klein, H.

Their documentations on Mamaind\u00ea specifically includes the following: Peter Kingston\u2019s unpublished master\u2019s thesis on Mamaind\u00ea repetition and other discourse features (Reading University, 1974), Kingston\u2019s \u201cSufixos referenciais e o elemento nominal na lingua Mamaind\u00ea\u201d on verb and noun morphology (published in Serie Linguistica 5:31-81, Brasilia, SIL), David Price\u2019s book \u201cBefore the Bulldozer\u201d in which Mamaind\u00ea history is covered in one section (1989), Paul Aspelin\u2019s dissertation on Mamaind\u00ea food exchange (1979), Dave Eberhard\u2019s published phonology thesis on Mamaind\u00ea stress (1995) and his two articles on prosodic features; a paper on Mamaind\u00ea nasals (on the Rutgers Optimality Archives website) and a paper on Mamaind\u00ea tone (in the proceedings of the Symposium on Andean and Amazonian Languages and Cultures, 2004, Vrije Universitieit, Amsterdam).\n\nOther research conducted with the Mamaind\u00ea includes Joan Miller\u2019s research beginning in 2002. \u00a0Miller has a PhD in Social Anthropology (CAPES Concept 7) from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, Brazil and has work entitled ''The Things. Body decorations and the notion of person for the Mamaind\u00ea (Nambiquara) 2007.'' She conducted a research project from 2007 - 2008 called Objectivization and subjectivation regimes in Amazonia: a study of the body adornments of Mamainde (Nambiquara). This project works to include the Mamainde enthnographic analysis into the debate about regimes of objectification and subjectivation in Amazonia and other ethnographic contexts such as Melanesia (Curriculo Lattes). \u00a0\n\nEdilberto Fernandes Syryczyk has a PhD in Science and Mathematics Education, REAMEC - UFMT Program (2016) that reaches along many categories including Indigenous Mathematical Knowledge, Indigenous Ethnomathematics, Indigenous Culture, Ethnology of Nambikwara, Mathematical Knowledge in Mamaind\u00ea. \u00a0He has contributed to an extension project called Arts & Culture Yucotindu that aims to promote the revitalization of the Mamainde culture.  The project works to foster spaces of cultural knowledge exchange among the Mamaind\u00ea for example by valorizing the tradition of hand crafted utensils (Curriculo Lattes).\n<br />\n\n==Varieties==\nAmong the Nambikwaran languages, at least Northern (Mamainde), Southern (Nambikwara), and Sabane are [[mutually unintelligible]]. Mamainde, however, is a [[dialect cluster]], and its varieties are sometimes considered distinct languages. The following distinctions are made by Eberhard (2009). Population figures are those of ''Ethnologue'' 16, dated 2007:\n\n* Mamaind\u00ea proper (including Nagarot\u00ea, 330 speakers)\n* Latund\u00ea (20)\n* Lakond\u00ea (1)\n* Tawaind\u00ea (or Da\u2019wan\u2019du; [[Attested language|unattested]] and speakers unknown)\n* Yalakalore (extinct and unattested)\n* Yalapmunde (Alapmunte; extinct and unattested)\n\nYelelihre is another unattested Nambikwaran variety.\n\n==Distribution==\nAnonby & Eberhard (2008:4)<ref name=\"anonby2008\">Anonby, Stan and David Eberhard. 2008.

This doesn\u2019t occur with all intransitives in Mamaind\u00ea (only occurs with emotive verbs), therefore it is considered a split-intransitive system<ref name=\":7\" /> .\n\nThere are five major distinctions that the impersonal construction in Mamaind\u00ea holds that separates it from [[Split ergativity|split-ergativity]]. Firstly, impersonals are identified by markings on verbs rather than nouns. Secondly, impersonals link the subject of intransitives with the object of transitive via morphology in which the underlying subject is marked as an object on the surface. Ergative-absolutive systems usually just tackle these situations with simple surface marking. \u00a0A third distinction is that the impersonal construction encodes the indirect object on the verb. Fourthly,  a requirement of impersonal constructions is introducing a dummy third person which is not necessary for the absolutive case.  Lastly, while the absolutive case can be used with any person as the agent of a verb, impersonal is only distinguishable with non-third person agents.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=539|via=}}</ref>\n\n\n\nImpersonal clause<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=537|via=}}</ref>:\n\nto\u0330-ta-lat\u02b0a-\u00d8-wa\n\nsick-O1-S3-PRS-DECL\n\n''It is sick to me (I am sick)''\n\n\n\nImpersonal clause displaying less frequent possibility of being transitive on semantic level<ref name=\":7\" />:\n\ntakalah-ta-lat\u02b0a-\u00d8-wa\n\nto.dislike-O1-S3-PRS-DECL\n\n''It is not liked by me (I don\u2019t like it'')\n\n== Semantics ==\n\n=== Plurality ===\n<br />In Mamaind\u00ea, no distinct set of pronouns designates number, rather it is actually indicated by a plural affix as demonstrated in (a) where ''child'' becomes ''children''. The number marker /-n\u00e3\u0294\u00e3/ is adjoined to the pronoun strictly when plurality is the focus as in (b).<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=360|via=}}</ref> In this particular example, the pronoun in the second sentence is singular although grandchildren (being the referent) is plural, given the first sentence. Accordingly, when this plural affix is absent, one is to assume the singularity of the noun or simply that number is not specifically in focus within the utterance. This pattern of default values, as exemplified by Eberhard findings on Mamaind\u00ea, is also found with gender and temporal markers.\n\nIn addition to the lack of an independent morpheme for plurals in this language, there is also \u201cno plural equivalent for the second and third person [[Possessive affix|possessives]]\u201d<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=347|via=}}</ref> . Instead, adding the plural marker on the pronoun (if necessary) will exhibit plurality, as these possessives continue to use the appropriate singular form as shown in (c).

Their [[endangerment]] arose as a result of various intertribal wars and massacres in the 30s and 40s as well as [[measles]] outbreaks, leaving them with only 50 Mamaind\u00ea members by 1965 according to SIL workers Peter and Shirley Kingston<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Cahill|first=M|date=2004|title=From Endangered to Less Endangered: Case Histories from Brazil and Papua New Guinea|url=https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/13/69/27/136927567288892881618167976727162966022/silewp2004_004.pdf|journal=SIL Electronic Working Papers (Revised Edition)|volume=|pages=4\u20135|via=}}</ref>.  Their population began to rebuild in the 90s, according to SIL workers Dave and Julie Eberhard, when they traced a steady increase in population size and found that their community had grown to 136 members by 1999<ref name=\":13\" />.\n\nTraditionally located in the Cabixi river region, the Mamaind\u00ea people belong to the Nambikwara language family. This language family was extensively studied by American [[Anthropologist]] and [[Ethnologist]], David Price, who describes the discovery of gold in the Coxipo river in 1719 as the root for the initial presence of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and other non-indigenous people in the Mato Grosso region. Being a variety of Northern Nambikwara, the Mamaind\u00ea indigenous group, specifically, only came into contact with Brazilian society about three generations ago<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Annoy, S. and Eberhard, D.|date=2008|title=A Survey of Three Northern Nambiquara Groups: The Mamaind\u00ea, Negarote, and Latunde|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237443290|journal=SIL Electronic Survey Report|volume=I|pages=3|via=}}</ref>.

Though contact between the indigenous and non-indigenous was both violent and peaceful, measles and massacres ultimately began to exterminate most Nambiwaran tribes. This [[genocide]], which occurred in a span of 30 years, paved the way for the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the survivors to local Brazilian populations (especially after losing their land), and eventually led to the creation of [[pidgin]]s/[[dialect]]s between their indigenous languages and Portuguese.\n\nWith a strenuous process, the Mamaind\u00ea were one of the few tribes able to regain \u201clegal title of their land\u201d<ref name=\":14\" />. Being initially given a heavily impoverished reserve in 1961, survival was especially wearisome. They decided to walk back to their original land anticipating better living conditions, though lost 30% of their already decaying population on their 400km journey<ref name=\":14\" />. In times of desperation and in hopes of giving their offspring a better chance of survival, Mamaind\u00ea mothers would even travel to the [[Cuiab\u00e1|Cuiaba]]-[[Porto Velho]] highway to give babies away to truck drivers and passerby\u2019s<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Anonby, S. and Eberhard, D.|date=2008|title=A Survey of Three Northern Nambiquara Groups: The Mamaind\u00ea, Negarote, and Latunde|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237443290|journal=SIL Electronic Survey Report|volume=I|pages=7|via=}}</ref>. During these arduous times when their population was down to 50 people and on the path to [[extinction]], [[SIL International]], a non-profit language development organization, became involved in their communities.

Rising familiarity with the bible led to part of it being translated into the Mamaind\u00ea language.

In addition, Price wrote \u201cThe Nambiquara Linguistic Family\u201d which classified 6 of the family\u2019s languages<ref name=\":15\" />. \u00a0His contribution to the Nambikwara documentation didn\u2019t end there, as he also wrote the published article \u201cPareci, Cabixi, Nambikwara: a Case study in the Western classification of native peoples\u201d (Journal de la Societe des Americanistes. 69:129-48, 1983). The book that dives into each specific Nambikwara group and its history called \u201cBefore the Bulldozer\u201d, was also written by Price in 1989.\n\nNambikwara has various other linguistic literature available as well. \u00a0A [[Linguistic description|descriptive grammar]] can be found for Nambikwara; Menno Kroeker wrote the journal article \u201cA Descriptive Grammar of Nambikuara\u201d in 2001 which was published by The University of Chicago Press.

Body decorations and the notion of person for the Mamaind\u00ea (Nambiquara) 2007.'' She conducted a research project from 2007 - 2008 called Objectivization and subjectivation regimes in Amazonia: a study of the body adornments of Mamainde (Nambiquara). This project works to include the Mamainde enthnographic analysis into the debate about regimes of objectification and subjectivation in Amazonia and other ethnographic contexts such as Melanesia (Curriculo Lattes). \u00a0\n\nEdilberto Fernandes Syryczyk has a PhD in Science and Mathematics Education, REAMEC - UFMT Program (2016) that reaches along many categories including Indigenous Mathematical Knowledge, Indigenous Ethnomathematics, Indigenous Culture, Ethnology of Nambikwara, Mathematical Knowledge in Mamaind\u00ea. \u00a0He has contributed to an extension project called Arts & Culture Yucotindu that aims to promote the revitalization of the Mamainde culture.  The project works to foster spaces of cultural knowledge exchange among the Mamaind\u00ea for example by valorizing the tradition of hand crafted utensils (Curriculo Lattes).\n<br />\n\n==Varieties==\nAmong the Nambikwaran languages, at least Northern (Mamainde), Southern (Nambikwara), and Sabane are [[mutually unintelligible]]. Mamainde, however, is a [[dialect cluster]], and its varieties are sometimes considered distinct languages. The following distinctions are made by Eberhard (2009). Population figures are those of ''Ethnologue'' 16, dated 2007:\n\n* Mamaind\u00ea proper (including Nagarot\u00ea, 330 speakers)\n* Latund\u00ea (20)\n* Lakond\u00ea (1)\n* Tawaind\u00ea (or Da\u2019wan\u2019du; [[Attested language|unattested]] and speakers unknown)\n* Yalakalore (extinct and unattested)\n* Yalapmunde (Alapmunte; extinct and unattested)\n\nYelelihre is another unattested Nambikwaran variety.\n\n==Distribution==\nAnonby & Eberhard (2008:4)<ref name=\"anonby2008\">Anonby, Stan and David Eberhard. 2008.

This doesn\u2019t occur with all intransitives in Mamaind\u00ea (only occurs with emotive verbs), therefore it is considered a split-intransitive system<ref name=\":7\" /> .\n\nThere are five major distinctions that the impersonal construction in Mamaind\u00ea holds that separates it from [[Split ergativity|split-ergativity]]. Firstly, impersonals are identified by markings on verbs rather than nouns. Secondly, impersonals link the subject of intransitives with the object of transitive via morphology in which the underlying subject is marked as an object on the surface. Ergative-absolutive systems usually just tackle these situations with simple surface marking. \u00a0A third distinction is that the impersonal construction encodes the indirect object on the verb. Fourthly,  a requirement of impersonal constructions is introducing a dummy third person which is not necessary for the absolutive case.  Lastly, while the absolutive case can be used with any person as the agent of a verb, impersonal is only distinguishable with non-third person agents<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=539|via=}}</ref>.\n\n\n\nImpersonal clause<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=537|via=}}</ref>:\n\nto\u0330-ta-lat\u02b0a-\u00d8-wa\n\nsick-O1-S3-PRS-DECL\n\n''It is sick to me (I am sick)''\n\n\n\nImpersonal clause displaying less frequent possibility of being transitive on semantic level<ref name=\":7\" />:\n\ntakalah-ta-lat\u02b0a-\u00d8-wa\n\nto.dislike-O1-S3-PRS-DECL\n\n''It is not liked by me (I don\u2019t like it'')\n\n== Semantics ==\n\n=== Plurality ===\n<br />In Mamaind\u00ea, no distinct set of pronouns designates number, rather it is actually indicated by a plural affix as demonstrated in (a) where ''child'' becomes ''children''.

In this particular example, the pronoun in the second sentence is singular although grandchildren (being the referent) is plural, given the first sentence. Accordingly, when this plural affix is absent, one is to assume the singularity of the noun or simply that number is not specifically in focus within the utterance. This pattern of default values, as exemplified by Eberhard findings on Mamaind\u00ea, is also found with gender and temporal markers.\n\nIn addition to the lack of an independent morpheme for plurals in this language, there is also \u201cno plural equivalent for the second and third person [[Possessive affix|possessives]]\u201d<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=D.M.|date=2009|title=A Northern Nambikwara language and its cultural context|url=https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42183922/mamainde+grammar+-+volume2.pdf|journal=Mamaind\u00ea Grammar|volume=II|pages=347|via=}}</ref> .

It was built over an earlier mosque constructed in 1153 by the first Muslim Sultan of Maldives, Mohamed Bin Abdullah, after his conversion to [[Islam]]. Although the older mosque was reportedly refurbished by Ahmed Shihabuddeen in 1338, there are no written records attesting this.{{Sfn|West|2009|p=493}}<ref name=Islam/> In 1656, Iskandar began building a new mosque when the old one became too small to accommodate the increasing number of devotees. Its construction, which took one-and-a-half years, was completed in 1658. Built primarily of coral, the mosque originally had a [[thatched roof]] (common during the period).<ref name=Islam/> After his 1668 [[Hajj]], Ibrahim I began building a ''munnaaru'' ([[minaret]]) and a gate at the southern end of the mosque. The minaret, patterned on those at the entrance to [[Mecca]], is surrounded by a 17th-century cemetery with intricately-carved tombstones and [[mausoleum]]s.<ref name=Islam/>{{Sfn|West|2009|p=493}}\n\nIn 1904, [[Muhammad Shamsuddeen III]] (1902\u20131934) replaced the thatched roof and southern gateway with corrugated-iron sheeting. Further renovations were made in 1963, converting the roof supports to [[teak]] wood and replacing the corrugated-iron sheeting with aluminium.

The Medhu Ziyaaraiy is the tomb of a [[Sunni]] Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari. Mal\u00e9 Friday Mosque was Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives.\n\n==History==\nThe [[mosque]] was built in 1658, during the reign of [[Ibrahim Iskandar I]] (1648\u20131687). It was built over an earlier mosque constructed in 1153 by the first Muslim Sultan of Maldives, Mohamed Bin Abdullah, after his conversion to [[Islam]]. Although the older mosque was reportedly refurbished by Ahmed Shihabuddeen in 1338, there are no written records attesting this.{{Sfn|West|2009|p=493}}<ref name=Islam/> In 1656, Iskandar began building a new mosque when the old one became too small to accommodate the increasing number of devotees. Its construction, which took one-and-a-half years, was completed in 1658. Built primarily of coral, the mosque originally had a [[thatched roof]] (common during the period).<ref name=Islam/> After his 1668 [[Hajj]], Ibrahim I began building a ''munnaaru'' ([[minaret]]) and a gate at the southern end of the mosque. The minaret, patterned on those at the entrance to [[Mecca]], is surrounded by a 17th-century cemetery with intricately-carved tombstones and [[mausoleum]]s.<ref name=Islam/>{{Sfn|West|2009|p=493}}\n\nIn 1904, [[Muhammad Shamsuddeen III]] (1902\u20131934) replaced the thatched roof and southern gateway with corrugated-iron sheeting. Further renovations were made in 1963, converting the roof supports to [[teak]] wood and replacing the corrugated-iron sheeting with aluminium. In 1987 and 1988, an Indian team from the [[National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property]] and the National Centre for Linguistic and Historical Research in Mal\u00e9 did conservation work on the mosque.<ref name=Islam/>\n\nMaldives' oldest mosque,{{Sfn|USA|2012|p=36}} it has been in continuous use since it was built.<ref name=Islam/> The mosque was reportedly built over an ancient temple which predated Islam; the original temple faced the setting sun, rather than Mecca.{{Sfn|Masters|2009|p=97}}\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Male-cementiri-tombes dels sultans.jpg|Sultans' Tumbs, [[Mal\u00e9]] Friday Mosque\n\nFile:Friday mosque Male woodcarving1981.jpg|Woodcarving inside Male' Friday Mosque\n</gallery>\n\n==Features==\nThe Mal\u00e9 Friday Mosque is oriented west.

With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by [[antechamber]]s on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps.
