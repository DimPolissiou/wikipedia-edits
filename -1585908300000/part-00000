But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers. (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held. The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\"). This is another All-India related festival. The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month of Savan (July/August). This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year. This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91). Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers. In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon. The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system. The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.' In \n the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony.\"<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137>\n{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/BhavishyaPuranaWithHindiTranslationPart3BaburamUpadhyaya20032/Bhavishya%20Purana%20with%20Hindi%20Translation%20Part%203%20-%20Baburam%20Upadhyaya%202003%20%282%29#page/n531|title=Bhavisha Mahapuranam with Hindi translation, Part 3|last = Upadhyay|first = Baburam (translator)|publisher=Hindi Sahitya Sammelan|location=Allahabad|year = 2003|pages=516\u2013518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Relation to territorial exogamy==\nOf special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village [[exogamy]]\u2014in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\" /> Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: <blockquote>Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with these rites, however, have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration,<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\">{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT148|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=148}}</ref> According to anthropologist, Leo Coleman: <blockquote> In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center\u2014the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\"/></blockquote> \n\nHindi movies have played a salient role.<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\">{{citation|last=Pandit |first=Vaijayanti|title=Business @ Home|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSFDDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA234|year=2003|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=978-81-259-1218-7|page=234}}</ref> According to author Vaijayanti Pandit, <blockquote> Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films. Lightweight and decorative rakhis, which are easy to post, are needed in large quantities by the market to cater to brothers and sisters living in different parts of the country or abroad.\"<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\"/></blockquote> More social interaction among India's population has played a role in the increased celebration of this festival.<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\" /> According to author Renuka Khandekar: <blockquote> But since independence and the gradual opening up of Indian society, Raksha Bandhan as celebrated in North India has won the affection of many South Indian families. For this festival has the peculiar charm of renewing sibling bonds.\"<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe festival has also been promoted by Hindu political organizations.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /> According to authors P. M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi. <blockquote> The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ... Till 20 years back, festivals like Raksha Bandhan' were unknown to South Indians. Through [[Sangh Shaka|Shakha]]'s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'\u2014the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'\u2014has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /></blockquote> \n\nSimilarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/> <blockquote> This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/></blockquote> Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\" /> as Leo Coleman states: <blockquote> ... as citizens become participants in the wider \"new traditions\" of the national state. Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-nation-building\"/></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, <blockquote> Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Voluntary kin relations==\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Prasad Rakhi 1953.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first president of the [[Republic of India]] celebrating Raksha Bandhan at the presidential palace, [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], in [[New Delhi]], 24 August 1953]]\nAmong women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,<ref name=\"HeitzmanWorden1996\" /> and Hindu and Muslim divisions.<ref name=\"MinesLamb2002\" /> In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.<ref name=\"Chowdhry1994\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, \"The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation.

Kolis are the fishermen community of the coastal state. The fishermen offer prayers to Lord Varuna, the Hindu god of Sea, to invoke his blessings.

The two boys become frustrated that they have no sister to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with. They ask their father Ganesha for a sister, but to no avail. Finally, saint Narada appears who persuades Ganesha that a daughter will enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection). Thereafter, Shubha Labha (literally \"Holy Profit\") had a sister named Santoshi Maa (literally \"Goddess of Satisfaction\"), to tie Rakhi over Raksha Bandhan.<ref name=\"Brown1991\">{{citation|last=Brown|first=Robert L.|title=Ganesh: Studies of an Asian God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oF-Hqih3pBAC&pg=PA150|year=1991|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0656-4|page=150}}</ref> According to author Robert Brown <blockquote> ... in Varanasi the paired figures were usually called Rddhi and Siddhi, Ganeea's relationship to them was often vague. He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers. (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held. The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\"). This is another All-India related festival. The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month of Savan (July/August). This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year. This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91). Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers. In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon. The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system. The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.' In \n the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony.\"<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137>\n{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/BhavishyaPuranaWithHindiTranslationPart3BaburamUpadhyaya20032/Bhavishya%20Purana%20with%20Hindi%20Translation%20Part%203%20-%20Baburam%20Upadhyaya%202003%20%282%29#page/n531|title=Bhavisha Mahapuranam with Hindi translation, Part 3|last = Upadhyay|first = Baburam (translator)|publisher=Hindi Sahitya Sammelan|location=Allahabad|year = 2003|pages=516\u2013518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Relation to territorial exogamy==\nOf special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village [[exogamy]]\u2014in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\" /> Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: <blockquote>Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with these rites, however, have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration,<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\">{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT148|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=148}}</ref> According to anthropologist, Leo Coleman: <blockquote> In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center\u2014the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\"/></blockquote> \n\nHindi movies have played a salient role.<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\">{{citation|last=Pandit |first=Vaijayanti|title=Business @ Home|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSFDDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA234|year=2003|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=978-81-259-1218-7|page=234}}</ref> According to author Vaijayanti Pandit, <blockquote> Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films. Lightweight and decorative rakhis, which are easy to post, are needed in large quantities by the market to cater to brothers and sisters living in different parts of the country or abroad.\"<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\"/></blockquote> More social interaction among India's population has played a role in the increased celebration of this festival.<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\" /> According to author Renuka Khandekar: <blockquote> But since independence and the gradual opening up of Indian society, Raksha Bandhan as celebrated in North India has won the affection of many South Indian families. For this festival has the peculiar charm of renewing sibling bonds.\"<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe festival has also been promoted by Hindu political organizations.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /> According to authors P. M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi. <blockquote> The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ... Till 20 years back, festivals like Raksha Bandhan' were unknown to South Indians. Through [[Sangh Shaka|Shakha]]'s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'\u2014the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'\u2014has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /></blockquote> \n\nSimilarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/> <blockquote> This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/></blockquote> Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\" /> as Leo Coleman states: <blockquote> ... as citizens become participants in the wider \"new traditions\" of the national state. Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-nation-building\"/></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, <blockquote> Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Voluntary kin relations==\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Prasad Rakhi 1953.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first president of the [[Republic of India]] celebrating Raksha Bandhan at the presidential palace, [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], in [[New Delhi]], 24 August 1953]]\nAmong women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,<ref name=\"HeitzmanWorden1996\" /> and Hindu and Muslim divisions.<ref name=\"MinesLamb2002\" /> In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.<ref name=\"Chowdhry1994\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, \"The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation.

Kolis are the fishermen community of the coastal state. The fishermen offer prayers to Lord Varuna, the Hindu god of Sea, to invoke his blessings. As part of the rituals, coconuts were thrown into the sea as offerings to Lord Varuna. The girls and women tie ''rakhi'' on their brother's wrist, as elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book|author=Victor J.

Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection).

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

It stars [[Gary Oldman]], [[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]], [[Charles Lawson]] and [[Steve McFadden]] in his acting debut. The film is based on the activities of the [[Inter City Firm]] (billed as the \"Inter City Crew\") [[Football hooliganism|football firm]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe film, which courted controversy on release, has come to be regarded among the finest films on the subject of football hooliganism. It is notable for having almost no musical score or [[wiktionary:diegetic|diegetic]] music, save for [[Dean Martin]]'s rendition of \"[[That's Amore (song)|That's Amore]]\" over the opening titles. Oldman's performance has been hailed as one of the greatest of his career.<ref>See [[#Reception and legacy|Reception and legacy]].</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nClive Bissel (nicknamed \"Bex\", or \"Bexy\") is a married man with a baby son. He is the leader of a hooligan firm known as the ICC (Inter City Crew). His wife no longer approves of his activities as a football hooligan, which contrast to his respectable job as an estate agent. Even when his baby son injures himself with a craft knife Bexy has carelessly left lying around, he is unwilling to give up violence as he admits it gives him a \"buzz\". Conversely, Bexy's father shows acceptance of his son's lifestyle, happily taking a group photograph of the 'tooled up' gang and boasting of similar activities in his own era. However, he feels that Bex and his friends have gone soft because they now use weapons and worry too much about strategy, instead of just getting on with fighting rival mobs.\n\nThe film begins with a rival gang called \"The Buccaneers\" vandalising Bexy's [[Ford_Sierra#XR4i_and_other_sporting_models|Ford Sierra XR4x4]] and spraying graffiti in a football dressing room while Bexy and his mates are playing football. Bexy's arch nemesis and leader of the Bucaneeers, Yeti, then drives a white [[Volkswagen Golf GTi]] cabriolet across the football pitch.\n\nWith an imminent international football tournament in Holland, Bexy wants to form a 'National Firm' - comprising several rival gangs - big enough to take on the well organised and large international hooligan groups. Bexy meets leaders from other firms in the [[Thistle Tower Hotel|Tower Hotel]] in London, including the Buccaneers. The other gangs like the idea but do not like the idea of Bexy being top boy. The rival firms then agree to fight each other in order to determine who will lead the new, amalgamated firm into Europe. \n\nBex and his fellow hooligans only possess any kind of social status amongst their own groups, and Bex relishes being looked up to and admired by the younger men in his own firm. Bexy used his natural leadership qualities to cajole and encourage his peers, and uses intimidation to cement his position as leader of the ICC. These young men think of themselves as important, respected figures in their local community, but Bexy's wife tells him that the truth is somewhat different. Everyone thinks of him as a joke, she says, but because they fear his violent nature, few are willing to point out to him that he is not the working class hero he thinks he is.\n\nThe ICC survive violent clashes with the other gangs but must still defeat the Buccaneers. Bexy is relishing the chance to defeat Yeti. Bexy beats up Yeti during the ICC's clash with the Buccaneers in a pub but is then shot dead by an injured Yeti.

They claim when they are fighting European firms at the forthcoming tournament, they will be doing so in memory of their dead leader. The hooligans from three different firms, who were fighting each other not long ago, agree that Bex was a visionary who brought them together, giving him legendary status, and that his death will not make them change their behaviour, as they vow to continue.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Oldman]] as Clive \"Bex\" Bissell\n*[[Lesley Manville]] as Sue Bissell\n* Albert Bentall as Sammy Bissell\n*[[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as \"Yeti\"\n*[[Andrew Wilde (actor)|Andrew Wilde]] as \"Oboe\"\n*[[Charles Lawson]] as \"Trigg\"\n*[[William Vanderpuye]] as \"Aitch\"\n*[[Jay Simpson (actor)|Jay Simpson]] as Dominic\n*[[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]] as \"Nunk\"\n*[[Robbie Gee]] as \"Snowy\"\n*[[Terry Sue-Patt]] as Yusef\n*[[Nick Dunning]] as Simon\n*Nicholas Hewetson as \"Beef\"\n*[[Steve McFadden]] as Billy\n*Steve Sweeney as JT\n*Hepburn Graham as Stu\n\n==Production==\nClarke's previous work for the BBC and ITV had seen him increasingly adopting, in the words of playwright David Hare, \"a style [...] sort of a democratic camera\", a more documentary-based approach to filming drama with greater use of the steadicam. Previous productions like Road (1987), Christine (1986), Contact (1984) and Made In Britain (1983) featured extended shots using the steadicam, an 'over the shoulder approach' that enabled greater insight into the action taking place onscreen.\n\nThe Firm was produced as part of the BBC's ScreenTwo drama series and was a first-time script by actor Al Ashton. Casting the role of Bexy with Gary Oldman was a conscious effort on the part of Alan Clarke. Oldman's then-wife Lesley Manville played the part of Bexy's wife Sue. Lighting cameraman and steadicam operator on the production John Ward noted that Gary Oldman was \"quite reticent about their onscreen fights because Lesley was pregnant at the time\". The violent confrontation between Bexy and his wife later in the film which gradually becomes more sexual caused controversy at the BBC at the time and had to be edited before broadcast. The actor playing the role of Bexy's child was played [[Janine Duvitski]]'s son.\n\nFilming for the film took place in Spring 1988 around Thamesmead in London in addition to further location filming at Blackheath, Woolwich, King's Cross Rail station and Edgbaston Rail Station in Birmingham. The meeting of all the rival firms to discuss their visit to Europe took place at Tower Hotel on Tower Bridge. Determined to make the acting in the film as authentic as possible, Clarke encouraged jeering, pushing and aggression between the different groups of actors representing each firm. \n\nThe Firm features several actors who would go onto bigger roles in the 1990s- Steve McFadden and Mark Monero would be respectively cast the following year as [[Phil Mitchell]] and [[Steve Elliott]] in [[Eastenders]] whilst Charles Lawson began his role as [[Jim McDonald]] in [[Coronation Street]] several months after The Firm was aired. Actors Steve Sweeney and Robbie Gee would find further success in films directed by [[Guy Ritchie]] ([Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch respectively). Phil Davies who played the role of Yeti would later direct his own film on football hooliganism [[I.D.]].\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n''The Firm'' proved controversial,<ref name=\"dalton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/critic-s-picks-gary-oldman-s-10-best-performances-1058864/item/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-gary-oldman-roles-1058863|title=Critic's Picks: Gary Oldman's 10 Best Performances|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|date=16 November 2017|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Ralske, Josh.

It stars [[Gary Oldman]], [[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]], [[Charles Lawson]] and [[Steve McFadden]] in his acting debut. The film is based on the activities of the [[Inter City Firm]] (billed as the \"Inter City Crew\") [[Football hooliganism|football firm]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe film, which courted controversy on release, has come to be regarded among the finest films on the subject of football hooliganism. It is notable for having almost no musical score or [[wiktionary:diegetic|diegetic]] music, save for [[Dean Martin]]'s rendition of \"[[That's Amore (song)|That's Amore]]\" over the opening titles. Oldman's performance has been hailed as one of the greatest of his career.<ref>See [[#Reception and legacy|Reception and legacy]].</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nClive Bissel (nicknamed \"Bex\", or \"Bexy\") is a married man with a baby son. He is the leader of a hooligan firm known as the ICC (Inter City Crew). His wife no longer approves of his activities as a football hooligan, which contrast to his respectable job as an estate agent. Even when his baby son injures himself with a craft knife Bexy has carelessly left lying around, he is unwilling to give up violence as he admits it gives him a \"buzz\". Conversely, Bexy's father shows acceptance of his son's lifestyle, happily taking a group photograph of the 'tooled up' gang and boasting of similar activities in his own era. However, he feels that Bex and his friends have gone soft because they now use weapons and worry too much about strategy, instead of just getting on with fighting rival mobs.\n\nThe film begins with a rival gang called \"The Buccaneers\" vandalising Bexy's [[Ford_Sierra#XR4i_and_other_sporting_models|Ford Sierra XR4x4]] and spraying graffiti in a football dressing room while Bexy and his mates are playing football. Bexy's arch nemesis and leader of the Bucaneeers, Yeti, then drives a white [[Volkswagen Golf GTi]] cabriolet across the football pitch.\n\nWith an imminent international football tournament in Holland, Bexy wants to form a 'National Firm' - comprising several rival gangs - big enough to take on the well organised and large international hooligan groups. Bexy meets leaders from other firms in the [[Thistle Tower Hotel|Tower Hotel]] in London, including the Buccaneers. The other gangs like the idea but do not like the idea of Bexy being top boy. The rival firms then agree to fight each other in order to determine who will lead the new, amalgamated firm into Europe. \n\nBex and his fellow hooligans only possess any kind of social status amongst their own groups, and Bex relishes being looked up to and admired by the younger men in his own firm. Bexy used his natural leadership qualities to cajole and encourage his peers, and uses intimidation to cement his position as leader of the ICC. These young men think of themselves as important, respected figures in their local community, but Bexy's wife tells him that the truth is somewhat different. Everyone thinks of him as a joke, she says, but because they fear his violent nature, few are willing to point out to him that he is not the working class hero he thinks he is.\n\nThe ICC survive violent clashes with the other gangs but must still defeat the Buccaneers. Bexy is relishing the chance to defeat Yeti. Bexy beats up Yeti during the ICC's clash with the Buccaneers in a pub but is then shot dead by an injured Yeti. Just before being shot, Bexy expresses astonishment and disbelief that Yeti has a gun, and says 'Oh, come on!' before Yeti pulls the trigger.\n\nThe closing scene depicts the surviving ICC members in a pub, honouring Bexy as a hero. They claim when they are fighting European firms at the forthcoming tournament, they will be doing so in memory of their dead leader. The hooligans from three different firms, who were fighting each other not long ago, agree that Bex was a visionary who brought them together, giving him legendary status, and that his death will not make them change their behaviour, as they vow to continue.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gary Oldman]] as Clive \"Bex\" Bissell\n*[[Lesley Manville]] as Sue Bissell\n* Albert Bentall as Sammy Bissell\n*[[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]] as \"Yeti\"\n*[[Andrew Wilde (actor)|Andrew Wilde]] as \"Oboe\"\n*[[Charles Lawson]] as \"Trigg\"\n*[[William Vanderpuye]] as \"Aitch\"\n*[[Jay Simpson (actor)|Jay Simpson]] as Dominic\n*[[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]] as \"Nunk\"\n*[[Robbie Gee]] as \"Snowy\"\n*[[Terry Sue-Patt]] as Yusef\n*[[Nick Dunning]] as Simon\n*Nicholas Hewetson as \"Beef\"\n*[[Steve McFadden]] as Billy\n*Steve Sweeney as JT\n*Hepburn Graham as Stu\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n''The Firm'' proved controversial,<ref name=\"dalton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/critic-s-picks-gary-oldman-s-10-best-performances-1058864/item/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy-gary-oldman-roles-1058863|title=Critic's Picks: Gary Oldman's 10 Best Performances|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|date=16 November 2017|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Ralske, Josh.

While similar to a lowercase [[X]], the form is properly a [[Rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetric]] [[saltire]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.2000.tb17262.x |last=Stallings |first=L. |year=2000 |title=A Brief History of Algebraic Notation |journal=School Science and Mathematics |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=230\u2013235 |issn=0036-6803 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe multiplication sign (\u00d7), often attributed to [[William Oughtred]] (who first used it in an appendix to the 1618 edition of [[John Napier]]'s ''Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio''), apparently had been in occasional use since the mid 16th century.<ref>Florian Cajori (1929), ''A History of Mathematical Notations'', Dover Books on Mathematics, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA251 pp. 251f.]</ref> \n\n==Uses==\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[symbol]] \u00d7 has a number of uses, including\n* [[Multiplication]] of two [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] numbers, where it is read as \"times\" or \"multiplied by\"\n* [[Cross product]] of two [[Vector space|vectors]], where it is usually read as \"cross\"\n* [[Cartesian product]] of two sets, where it is usually read as \"cross\"\n* Geometric dimension of an object, such as noting that a room is 10 feet \u00d7 12 feet in area, where it is usually read as \"by\" (for example: \"10 feet by 12 feet\")\n* Dimensions of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], where it is usually read as \"by\"\n* A [[Interaction (statistics)|statistical interaction]] between two explanatory [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], where it is usually read as \"by\"\n\nIn [[biology]], the multiplication sign is used in a botanical [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid name]], for instance ''Ceanothus papillosus'' \u00d7 ''impressus'' (a hybrid between ''[[Ceanothus papillosus|C. papillosus]]'' and ''[[Ceanothus impressus|C. impressus]]'') or ''[[Crocosmia \u00d7 crocosmiiflora]]'' (a hybrid between two other species of ''Crocosmia''). However, the communication of these hybrid names with a standard non-multiplication \"x\" is common when the actual \"\u00d7\" symbol is not readily available.\n\nThe multiplication sign is also used by [[historian]]s for an event between two [[Calendar date|dates]]. When employed between two dates, for example 1225 and 1232, 1225\u00d71232 means \"no earlier than 1225 and no later than 1232\".<ref>{{citation |title=New Hart's rules: the handbook of style for writers and editors |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-861041-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri/page/183 183] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri/page/183 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Monad (functional programming)|monadic]] \u00d7 symbol is used by the [[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]] to denote the [[sign function]].\n\n== Similar notations ==\n{{Main|Multiplication#Notation and terminology|l1=Multiplication: Notation and terminology}}\n\nThe letter \"[[x]]\" is sometimes used in place of the multiplication sign. This is considered incorrect in mathematical writing.\n\nIn [[algebra]]ic notation, widely used in mathematics, a multiplication symbol is usually omitted wherever it would not cause confusion: \"{{mvar|a}} multiplied by {{mvar|b}}\" can be written as {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a\u2009b''}}.\n\nOther symbols can also be used to denote multiplication, often to reduce confusion between the multiplication sign \u00d7 and the common variable {{mvar|x}}. In many non-Anglophone countries the primary symbol for multiplication is '''\u22c5''' (the \"[[dot operator]]\") as in ''{{math|a\u22c5b}}''. This symbol is also used in algebraic notation to resolve ambiguity, for instance \"b times 2\" may be written {{math|''b''&sdot;2}} to avoid being confused with a value called {{math|''b<sub>2</sub>''}}.

However, the communication of these hybrid names with a standard non-multiplication \"x\" is common when the actual \"\u00d7\" symbol is not readily available.\n\nThe multiplication sign is also used by [[historian]]s for an event between two [[Calendar date|dates]]. When employed between two dates, for example 1225 and 1232, 1225\u00d71232 means \"no earlier than 1225 and no later than 1232\".<ref>{{citation |title=New Hart's rules: the handbook of style for writers and editors |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-861041-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri/page/183 183] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri/page/183 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Monad (functional programming)|monadic]] \u00d7 symbol is used by the [[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]] to denote the [[sign function]].\n\n== Similar notations ==\n{{Main|Multiplication#Notation and terminology|l1=Multiplication: Notation and terminology}}\n\nThe letter \"[[x]]\" is sometimes used in place of the multiplication sign. This is considered incorrect in mathematical writing.\n\nIn [[algebra]]ic notation, widely used in mathematics, a multiplication symbol is usually omitted wherever it would not cause confusion: \"{{mvar|a}} multiplied by {{mvar|b}}\" can be written as {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a\u2009b''}}.\n\nOther symbols can also be used to denote multiplication, often to reduce confusion between the multiplication sign \u00d7 and the common variable {{mvar|x}}. In many non-Anglophone countries the primary symbol for multiplication is '''\u22c5''' (the \"[[dot operator]]\") as in ''{{math|a\u22c5b}}''. This symbol is also used in algebraic notation to resolve ambiguity, for instance \"b times 2\" may be written {{math|''b''&sdot;2}} to avoid being confused with a value called {{math|''b<sub>2</sub>''}}. This notation is used wherever multiplication should be written explicitly, such as in \"{{math|1= ''ab'' = ''a''&sdot;2}} for {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}\"; this usage is also seen in English-language texts. In some languages (especially [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} and French {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}) the use of [[full stop]] as a multiplication symbol, such as {{math|''a''.''b''}}, is common.\n\nHistorically, computer language [[syntax (programming)|syntax]] was restricted to the [[ASCII]] character set and the [[asterisk]] <code>*</code> became the de facto symbol for the multiplication operator.
