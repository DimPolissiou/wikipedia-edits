His personal sacrifice and untiring efforts to keep the Jamia afloat in very adverse circumstances won him appreciation of even his arch political rivals like [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]].\n\nSoon after India attained independence, Husain agreed to be the Vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University which was facing trying times in post partition India because of active involvement of a section of its teachers and students in the movement for creation of [[Pakistan]].

It also set [[Texas]]'s western and northern borders and included provisions addressing [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] and the slave trade. The compromise was brokered by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] senator [[Henry Clay]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Stephen Douglas]] with the support of President [[Millard Fillmore]].\n\nA debate over slavery in the territories had erupted during the Mexican\u2013American War, as many Southerners sought to expand slavery to the newly-acquired lands and many Northerners opposed any such expansion. The debate was further complicated by Texas's claim to all former Mexican territory north and east of the [[Rio Grande]], including areas it had never effectively controlled. These issues prevented the passage of [[organic act]]s to create organized territorial governments for the land acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War. In early 1850, [[Henry Clay|Clay]] proposed a package of bills that would settle most of the pressing issues before Congress. Clay's proposal was opposed by President [[Zachary Taylor]], anti-slavery Whigs like [[William Seward]], and pro-slavery Democrats like [[John C. Calhoun]], and congressional debate over the territories continued.\n\nAfter Taylor died and was succeeded by Fillmore, Douglas took the lead in passing Clay's compromise through Congress as five separate bills. Under the compromise, Texas surrendered its claims to present-day [[New Mexico]] and other states in return for federal assumption of Texas's public debt. [[California]] was admitted as a free state, while the remaining portions of the Mexican Cession were organized into [[New Mexico Territory]] and [[Utah Territory]]. Under the concept of [[popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], the people of each territory would decide whether or not slavery would be permitted. The compromise also included a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]] and banned the slave trade in [[Washington, D.C.]] The issue of slavery in the territories would be re-opened by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], but many historians argue that the Compromise of 1850 played a major role in postponing the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Presidency of James K.

While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.\n\n===Texas===\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Proposals for Texas's northwestern boundary]]\n\nThe independent [[Republic of Texas]] won the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]] (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]]. He signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], which recognized the [[Rio Grande]] as the boundary of the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated by the government of Mexico, which insisted that Mexico remained sovereign over Texas since Santa Anna had signed the treaty under coercion, and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a ''de facto'' recognition, Mexico treated the [[Nueces River]] as its northern boundary control. A vast, largely-unsettled area was between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its territorial claim. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|28th state]]. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making it illegal for the legislature to free slaves.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made no mention of the claims of the Republic of Texas; Mexico simply agreed to a [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] south of both the \"Mexican Cession\" and the Republic of Texas claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/nbc02|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Compromise of 1850|website=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=2016-02-03|date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> After the end of the Mexican\u2013American War, Texas continued to claim a large stretch of disputed land that it had never effectively controlled in present-day eastern New Mexico. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas's capital lay hundreds of miles away{{sfn|Smith|pp=98, 101\u2013102}} and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]].{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=65\u201366}} Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas's claims to New Mexico to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery.{{sfn|Bordewich|p=149}}\n\nAnother issue that would affect the compromise was Texas's debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories.{{sfn|Smith|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n===California===\n[[File:Map of Mexico including Yucatan and Upper California 1847.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Map of Mexico''. S. Augustus Mitchell, Philadelphia, 1847. New California is depicted with a northeastern border at the meridian leading north of the Rio Grande [[source (river or stream)|headwaters]].]]\n\nCalifornia was part of the Mexican Cession. After the Mexican War, California was essentially run by military governors. President [[James K. Polk]] tried to get Congress to establish a territorial government in California officially, but the increasingly sectional debates prevented that.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States. By United States. President (1849\u20131850 : Taylor), United States. War Dept (Ex. Doc 17 page 1) Google eBook</ref> The South wanted to extend slave territory to [[Southern California]] and to the Pacific Coast, but the North did not.\n\nFrom late 1848, Americans and foreigners of many different countries rushed into California for the [[California Gold Rush]], exponentially increasing the population. In response to growing demand for a better more representative government, a [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1849. The delegates unanimously outlawed slavery. They had no interest in extending the Missouri Compromise Line through California and splitting the state; the lightly populated southern half never had slavery and was heavily Hispanic.<ref>William Henry Ellison. ''A self-governing dominion, California, 1849\u20131860'' (1950) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8v4nWGB0T0C online]</ref>\n\n===Other issues===\nAside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years.{{sfn|Smith|pp=98\u201399}} The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of [[due process]] in these cases, had passed [[personal liberty laws]] that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South.{{sfn|Finkelman|pp=58\u201362, 71}} Congress also faced the issue of [[Utah]], which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by [[Mormons]], whose practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] was unpopular in the United States.{{sfn|Smith|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Passage==\n===Taylor takes office===\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n{{Further|Presidency of Zachary Taylor}}\n\nWhen Taylor took office, the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained unresolved. While a Southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy.<ref>[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 101\u2013102.</ref> In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the [[Gold Rush]] was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.<ref>Bauer, pp. 290\u2013291.</ref> In October 1849, a California constitutional convention unanimously agreed to join the Union\u2014and to ban slavery within their borders.<ref>Bauer, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> In his December 1849 [[State of the Union address|State of the Union report]], Taylor endorsed California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and \"should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character\".<ref>Bauer, p. 298\u2013299.</ref>\n\n===Clay proposes compromise===\n\n[[File:Henry Clay Senate3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'''\"The United States Senate, A.D. 1850\"''' (engraving by [[Peter F. Rothermel]]):<br />[[Henry Clay]] takes the floor of the [[Old Senate Chamber]]; Vice President [[Millard Fillmore]] presides as [[John C. Calhoun]] (to the right of the Speaker's chair) and [[Daniel Webster]] (seated to the left of Clay) look on.]]\n\nOn January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New mexican Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|pp=111\u2013112}} Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, but Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California's admission and the disposition of Texas's borders into one bill.{{sfn|Smith|pp=132\u2013139}} Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince congressmen from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Clay's proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}}\n\n===Opposition===\n\nPresident Taylor opposed the compromise and continued to call for immediate statehood for both California and New Mexico.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] and some other Southern leaders argued that the compromise was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states.{{sfn|Smith|pp=112\u2013113, 117}} Most Northern Whigs, led by [[William Henry Seward]], who delivered his famous \"Higher Law\" speech during the controversy, opposed the Compromise as well because it would apply the Wilmot Proviso to the western territories and because of the pressing of ordinary citizens into duty on slave-hunting patrols. That provision was inserted by Democratic Virginia Senator [[James M. Mason]] to entice border-state Whigs, who faced the greatest danger of losing slaves as fugitives but were lukewarm on general sectional issues related to the South on Texas's land claims.<ref>John M. Taylor, ''William Henry Seward: Lincoln's right hand'' (1996) p. 85</ref>\n\n===Debate and results===\n{{see also|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}\n[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|An animation showing [[slave and free states]] and territories, 1789\u20131861]]\n\nOn April 17, a \"Committee of Thirteen\" agreed on the border of Texas as part of Clay's plan. The dimensions were later changed. That same day, during debates on the measures in the Senate, Vice President Fillmore and Senator Benton verbally sparred, with Fillmore charging that the Missourian was \"out of order.\" During the heated debates, Compromise floor leader [[Henry S. Foote]] of [[Mississippi]] drew a pistol on Benton.\n\nIn early June, nine slaveholding Southern states sent delegates to the [[Nashville Convention]] to determine their course of action if the compromise passed. While some delegates preached [[secession]], the moderates ruled and proposed a series of compromises, including extending the dividing line designated by the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]].\n\nTaylor died in July 1850, and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore, who had privately come to support Clay's proposal.{{sfn|Smith|pp=158, 165\u2013166}} The various bills were initially combined into one \"omnibus\" bill. Despite Clay's efforts, it failed in a crucial vote on July 31, opposed by southern Democrats and by northern Whigs. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to pass each part of the bill. The 73-year-old Clay, however, was physically exhausted as the effects of [[tuberculosis]], which would eventually kill him, began to take their toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took the lead in attempting to pass Clay's proposals through the Senate.<ref>Eaton (1957) pp. 192\u2013193. Remini (1991) pp. 756\u2013759</ref>\n\nFillmore, anxious to find a quick solution to the conflict in Texas over the border with New Mexico, which threatened to become an armed conflict between Texas militia and the federal soldiers, reversed the administration's position late in July and threw its support to the compromise measures.<ref>Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), pp. 529\u2013530: \"only rapid passage of the omnibus bill appeared to offer a timely escape from the crisis.\"</ref> At the same time, Fillmore denied Texas's claims to New Mexico, asserting that the United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.{{sfn|Smith|pp=181\u2013184}} Fillmore's forceful response helped convince Texas's U.S. Senators, [[Sam Houston]] and [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]], to support Stephen Douglas's compromise. With their support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36\u00b0 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=306\u2013313}} The Senate quickly moved onto the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=314\u2013316, 329}}\n\nThe debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Senator [[Daniel Webster]], Douglas, Congressman [[Linn Boyd]], and Speaker of the House [[Howell Cobb]] took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=333\u2013334}} The Senate's proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate.{{sfn|Smith|pp=186\u2013188}} Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington.{{sfn|Smith|p=188\u2013189}} The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional.{{sfn|Scarry|p=172}} Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=347\u2013348, 359\u2013360}}\n\n==Provisions==\n===Settlement of borders===\n[[File:New Mexico Territory, 1852.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of [[New Mexico Territory]] in 1852]]\n[[File:Utah Territory with Deseret Border, vector image - 2011.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Utah Territory is shown in blue and outlined in black. The boundaries of the provisional [[State of Deseret]] are shown with a dotted line.]]\n\nThe general solution that was adopted by the Compromise of 1850 was to transfer a considerable part of the territory claimed by Texas state to the federal government; to organize two new territories formally, the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, which expressly would be allowed to locally determine whether they would become slave or free territories, to add another free state to the Union (California), to adopt a severe measure to recover slaves who had escaped to a free state or free territory (the Fugitive Slave Law); and to abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. A key provision of each of the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failure to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.  However, the admission of California as a free state meant that southerners were giving up their goal of a coast-to-coast belt of slave states.<ref>Not all southerners gave up on the idea. After California's admission, there were several [[Partition_and_secession_in_California#Post-statehood|efforts to divide the state]].  At least one of these enjoyed significant support from southern members of Congress, but the Civil War prevented action on it.</ref>\n\nTexas was allowed to keep the following portions of the disputed land: south of the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]] and south of the [[36\u00b030' parallel north]] and east of the [[103rd meridian west]]. The rest of the disputed land was transferred to the Federal Government. The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) does not permit Congress unilaterally to reduce the territory of any state, so the first part of the Compromise of 1850 had to take the form of an offer to the Texas State Legislature, rather than a unilateral enactment. This ratified the bargain and, in due course, the transfer of a broad swath of land from the state of Texas to the federal government was accomplished. In return for giving up this land, the United States assumed the debts of Texas.\n\nFrom the Mexican Cession, the New Mexico Territory received most of the present-day state of Arizona, most of the western part of the present-day state of New Mexico, and the southern tip of present-day Nevada (south of the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]]). The territory also received most of present-day eastern New Mexico, a portion of present-day Colorado (east of the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]], west of the 103rd meridian, and south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]); all of this land had been claimed by Texas.\n\nFrom the Mexican Cession, the Utah Territory received present-day Utah, most of present-day Nevada (everything north of the 37th parallel), a major part of present-day Colorado (everything west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains), and a small part of present-day Wyoming. That included the newly founded colony at [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake]], of [[Brigham Young]]. The Utah Territory also received some land that had claimed by Texas; this land is now part of present-day Colorado that is east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n===Fugitive Slave Law===\nOne statute of the Compromise of 1850, enacted September 18, 1850, is informally known as the Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act. It bolstered the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]]. The new version of the Fugitive Slave Law required federal judicial officials in all states and federal territories, including in those states and territories in which slavery was prohibited, to assist with the return of escaped slaves to their masters actively in the states and territories permitting slavery. Any [[US Marshals Service|federal marshal]] or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave was liable to a fine of $1000. Law enforcement everywhere in the US had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a [[fugitive slave]] on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. Suspected slaves could neither ask for a jury trial nor testify on their own behalf. Also, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was to be subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1000 fine. Officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to a fee for their work.\n\nIn addition to federal officials, the ordinary citizens of free states could be summoned to join a posse and be required to assist in the capture, custody, and/or transportation of the alleged escaped slave.\n\nThe law was so rigorously pro-slavery as to prohibit the admission of the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine the status of the accused escaped slave. Thus, if a freedman were claimed to be an escaped slave, they could not resist their return to slavery by truthfully telling their actual history.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act was essential to meet Southern demands. In terms of public opinion in the North, the critical provision was that ordinary citizens were required to aid slave catchers. Many northerners deeply resented that requirement to help slavery personally. Resentment towards the Act continued to heighten tensions between the North and South, which were inflamed further by abolitionists such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Her book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', stressed the horrors of recapturing escaped slaves and outraged Southerners.<ref>Larry Gara, \"The Fugitive Slave Law: A Double Paradox,\" ''Civil War History'', September 1964, vol. 10#3, pp. 229\u2013240</ref>\n\n===End of slave trade in District of Columbia===\nA statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade but allowed slavery itself in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>David L. Lewis, ''District of Columbia: A Bicentennial History'', (W.W. Norton, 1976), 54-56.</ref> Southerners in Congress were unanimous in opposing that provision, which was seen as a concession to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], but they were outvoted.<ref>Damani Davis, \"Slavery and Emancipation in the Nation'S Capital,\" ''Prologue'', Spring 2010, vol. 42#1, pp. 52\u201359</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n{{see also|Presidency of Franklin Pierce|Origins of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:Map of Free and Slave States.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of free and slave states {{circa|1856}}]]\n\nPassage of the Compromise of 1850, as it became known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, \"the Union is saved!\" Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \"final settlement\" of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=75\u201376}} The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=121\u2013123}}{{sfn|Smith|p=248}} Not all accepted the Compromise of 1850; a South Carolina newspaper wrote, \"the [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon is passed]] ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.\"{{sfn|Smith|pp=193\u2013194}} Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|p=201}} The debate over slavery in the territories would be re-opened in 1854 through the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].\n\nMany historians argue that the Compromise played a major role in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer relations with the Northeast.<ref>Robert Remini,''The House: A History of the House of Representatives'' (2006) p. 147</ref> During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South.<ref>Holt, Michael F. ''The Political Crisis of the 1850s'' (1978).</ref>\n\nOthers argue that the Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law as helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]], contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.\n\nThe delay of hostilities for ten years allowed the free economy of the northern states to continue to industrialize. The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily.<ref>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, ''Fruits of Merchant Capital'' (1983).</ref> By 1860, the northern states had added many more miles of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.\n\nAccording to historian Mark Stegmaier, \"The Fugitive Slave Act, the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, the admission of California as a free state, and even the application of the formula of popular sovereignty to the territories were all less important than the least remembered component of the Compromise of 1850\u2014the statute by which Texas relinquished its claims to much of New Mexico in return for federal assumption of the debts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDp6AAAAMAAJ|author=Mark J.

It passed the House in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later, an effort failed to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].\n* The '''Extension of the Missouri Compromise line''' was proposed by failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then Stephen Douglas to extend the Missouri Compromise line ([[36\u00b030' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific (south of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]) to allow the possibility of slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, and Southern California. That line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.\n* '''[[Popular sovereignty]]''', developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Stephen Douglas as the position of the Democratic Party, was to let each territory decide for itself whether to allow slavery.\n* [[William L. Yancey]]'s '''\"Alabama Platform\"''', endorsed by the Alabama and the Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories by the federal government or territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws.\n* '''Two free states''' were proposed by [[Zachary Taylor]], who served as President from March 1849 to July 1850. As President, he proposed that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the ones today. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], which would avoid the question of slavery in the territories.\n* '''Changing Texas's borders''' was proposed by Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in December 1849 or January 1850. Texas's western and northern boundaries would be the [[102nd meridian west]] and the [[34th parallel north]].\n* '''Two southern states''' were proposed by Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], with the assent of Texas, in February 1850. New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the 34th parallel north, including today's [[Texas Panhandle]], while the area to the south, including the southeastern part of today's New Mexico, would be divided at the [[Colorado River of Texas]] into two Southern states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ADJUSTMENT OF THE TEXAS BOUNDARY IN 1850.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNQ1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185|journal=Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association|date=January 1904|volume=7|author=W.

It also set [[Texas]]'s western and northern borders and included provisions addressing [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] and the slave trade. The compromise was brokered by [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] senator [[Henry Clay]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Stephen Douglas]] with the support of President [[Millard Fillmore]].\n\nA debate over slavery in the territories had erupted during the Mexican\u2013American War, as many Southerners sought to expand slavery to the newly-acquired lands and many Northerners opposed any such expansion. The debate was further complicated by Texas's claim to all former Mexican territory north and east of the [[Rio Grande]], including areas it had never effectively controlled. These issues prevented the passage of [[organic act]]s to create organized territorial governments for the land acquired in the Mexican\u2013American War. In early 1850, [[Henry Clay|Clay]] proposed a package of bills that would settle most of the pressing issues before Congress. Clay's proposal was opposed by President [[Zachary Taylor]], anti-slavery Whigs like [[William Seward]], and pro-slavery Democrats like [[John C. Calhoun]], and congressional debate over the territories continued.\n\nAfter Taylor died and was succeeded by Fillmore, Douglas took the lead in passing Clay's compromise through Congress as five separate bills. Under the compromise, Texas surrendered its claims to present-day [[New Mexico]] and other states in return for federal assumption of Texas's public debt. [[California]] was admitted as a free state, while the remaining portions of the Mexican Cession were organized into [[New Mexico Territory]] and [[Utah Territory]]. Under the concept of [[popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]], the people of each territory would decide whether or not slavery would be permitted. The compromise also included a more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Law]] and banned the slave trade in [[Washington, D.C.]] The issue of slavery in the territories would be re-opened by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], but many historians argue that the Compromise of 1850 played a major role in postponing the [[American Civil War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Presidency of James K.

While capable of analytical distinction, the boundary and territory issues were included in the overarching issue of slavery. Pro-slavery and anti-slavery interests were each concerned with both the amount of land on which slavery was permitted and with the number of States in the slave or free camps. Since Texas was a slave state, not only the residents of that state but also both camps on a national scale had an interest in the size of Texas.\n\n===Texas===\n[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|Proposals for Texas's northwestern boundary]]\n\nThe independent [[Republic of Texas]] won the decisive [[Battle of San Jacinto]] (April 21, 1836) against Mexico and captured Mexican president [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]]. He signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], which recognized the [[Rio Grande]] as the boundary of the Republic of Texas. The treaties were then repudiated by the government of Mexico, which insisted that Mexico remained sovereign over Texas since Santa Anna had signed the treaty under coercion, and promised to reclaim the lost territories. To the extent that there was a ''de facto'' recognition, Mexico treated the [[Nueces River]] as its northern boundary control. A vast, largely-unsettled area was between the two rivers. Neither Mexico nor the Republic of Texas had the military strength to assert its territorial claim. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States and became the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|28th state]]. Texas was staunchly committed to slavery, with its constitution making it illegal for the legislature to free slaves.\n\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo made no mention of the claims of the Republic of Texas; Mexico simply agreed to a [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] south of both the \"Mexican Cession\" and the Republic of Texas claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/nbc02|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Compromise of 1850|website=Tshaonline.org |accessdate=2016-02-03|date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> After the end of the Mexican\u2013American War, Texas continued to claim a large stretch of disputed land that it had never effectively controlled in present-day eastern New Mexico. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas's capital lay hundreds of miles away{{sfn|Smith|pp=98, 101\u2013102}} and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition|Santa Fe Expedition]].{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=65\u201366}} Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas's claims to New Mexico to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery.{{sfn|Bordewich|p=149}}\n\nAnother issue that would affect the compromise was Texas's debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories.{{sfn|Smith|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n===California===\n[[File:Map of Mexico including Yucatan and Upper California 1847.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Map of Mexico''. S. Augustus Mitchell, Philadelphia, 1847. New California is depicted with a northeastern border at the meridian leading north of the Rio Grande [[source (river or stream)|headwaters]].]]\n\nCalifornia was part of the Mexican Cession. After the Mexican War, California was essentially run by military governors. President [[James K. Polk]] tried to get Congress to establish a territorial government in California officially, but the increasingly sectional debates prevented that.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States. By United States. President (1849\u20131850 : Taylor), United States. War Dept (Ex. Doc 17 page 1) Google eBook</ref> The South wanted to extend slave territory to [[Southern California]] and to the Pacific Coast, but the North did not.\n\nFrom late 1848, Americans and foreigners of many different countries rushed into California for the [[California Gold Rush]], exponentially increasing the population. In response to growing demand for a better more representative government, a [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]] was held in 1849. The delegates unanimously outlawed slavery. They had no interest in extending the Missouri Compromise Line through California and splitting the state; the lightly populated southern half never had slavery and was heavily Hispanic.<ref>William Henry Ellison. ''A self-governing dominion, California, 1849\u20131860'' (1950) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8v4nWGB0T0C online]</ref>\n\n===Other issues===\nAside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years.{{sfn|Smith|pp=98\u201399}} The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of [[due process]] in these cases, had passed [[personal liberty laws]] that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South.{{sfn|Finkelman|pp=58\u201362, 71}} Congress also faced the issue of [[Utah]], which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by [[Mormons]], whose practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamy]] was unpopular in the United States.{{sfn|Smith|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Passage==\n===Taylor takes office===\n{{Events leading to US Civil War}}\n{{Further|Presidency of Zachary Taylor}}\n\nWhen Taylor took office, the issue of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained unresolved. While a Southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy.<ref>[[#Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], pp. 101\u2013102.</ref> In Taylor's view, the best way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery question out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the [[Gold Rush]] was well underway at the time of his inauguration, and California's population was exploding.<ref>Bauer, pp. 290\u2013291.</ref> In October 1849, a California constitutional convention unanimously agreed to join the Union\u2014and to ban slavery within their borders.<ref>Bauer, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> In his December 1849 [[State of the Union address|State of the Union report]], Taylor endorsed California's and New Mexico's applications for statehood, and recommended that Congress approve them as written and \"should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topics of a sectional character\".<ref>Bauer, p. 298\u2013299.</ref>\n\n===Clay proposes compromise===\n\n[[File:Henry Clay Senate3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'''\"The United States Senate, A.D. 1850\"''' (engraving by [[Peter F.

Calhoun]] (to the right of the Speaker's chair) and [[Daniel Webster]] (seated to the left of Clay) look on.]]\n\nOn January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the [[State cessions|cession]] by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of [[New mexican Territory|New Mexico]] and [[Utah Territory|Utah]] territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|pp=111\u2013112}} Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, but Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California's admission and the disposition of Texas's borders into one bill.{{sfn|Smith|pp=132\u2013139}} Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince congressmen from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Clay's proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}}\n\n===Opposition===\n\nPresident Taylor opposed the compromise and continued to call for immediate statehood for both California and New Mexico.{{sfn|McPherson|p=74}} Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] and some other Southern leaders argued that the compromise was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states.{{sfn|Smith|pp=112\u2013113, 117}} Most Northern Whigs, led by [[William Henry Seward]], who delivered his famous \"Higher Law\" speech during the controversy, opposed the Compromise as well because it would apply the Wilmot Proviso to the western territories and because of the pressing of ordinary citizens into duty on slave-hunting patrols. That provision was inserted by Democratic Virginia Senator [[James M. Mason]] to entice border-state Whigs, who faced the greatest danger of losing slaves as fugitives but were lukewarm on general sectional issues related to the South on Texas's land claims.<ref>John M. Taylor, ''William Henry Seward: Lincoln's right hand'' (1996) p. 85</ref>\n\n===Debate and results===\n{{see also|Presidency of Millard Fillmore}}\n[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|An animation showing [[slave and free states]] and territories, 1789\u20131861]]\n\nOn April 17, a \"Committee of Thirteen\" agreed on the border of Texas as part of Clay's plan. The dimensions were later changed. That same day, during debates on the measures in the Senate, Vice President Fillmore and Senator Benton verbally sparred, with Fillmore charging that the Missourian was \"out of order.\" During the heated debates, Compromise floor leader [[Henry S. Foote]] of [[Mississippi]] drew a pistol on Benton.\n\nIn early June, nine slaveholding Southern states sent delegates to the [[Nashville Convention]] to determine their course of action if the compromise passed. While some delegates preached [[secession]], the moderates ruled and proposed a series of compromises, including extending the dividing line designated by the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 to the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]].\n\nTaylor died in July 1850, and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore, who had privately come to support Clay's proposal.{{sfn|Smith|pp=158, 165\u2013166}} The various bills were initially combined into one \"omnibus\" bill. Despite Clay's efforts, it failed in a crucial vote on July 31, opposed by southern Democrats and by northern Whigs. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to pass each part of the bill. The 73-year-old Clay, however, was physically exhausted as the effects of [[tuberculosis]], which would eventually kill him, began to take their toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] took the lead in attempting to pass Clay's proposals through the Senate.<ref>Eaton (1957) pp. 192\u2013193. Remini (1991) pp. 756\u2013759</ref>\n\nFillmore, anxious to find a quick solution to the conflict in Texas over the border with New Mexico, which threatened to become an armed conflict between Texas militia and the federal soldiers, reversed the administration's position late in July and threw its support to the compromise measures.<ref>Michael Holt, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party'' (1999), pp. 529\u2013530: \"only rapid passage of the omnibus bill appeared to offer a timely escape from the crisis.\"</ref> At the same time, Fillmore denied Texas's claims to New Mexico, asserting that the United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.{{sfn|Smith|pp=181\u2013184}} Fillmore's forceful response helped convince Texas's U.S. Senators, [[Sam Houston]] and [[Thomas Jefferson Rusk]], to support Stephen Douglas's compromise. With their support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36\u00b0 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=306\u2013313}} The Senate quickly moved onto the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=314\u2013316, 329}}\n\nThe debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Senator [[Daniel Webster]], Douglas, Congressman [[Linn Boyd]], and Speaker of the House [[Howell Cobb]] took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=333\u2013334}} The Senate's proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate.{{sfn|Smith|pp=186\u2013188}} Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington.{{sfn|Smith|p=188\u2013189}} The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]]; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional.{{sfn|Scarry|p=172}} Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise.{{sfn|Bordewich|pp=347\u2013348, 359\u2013360}}\n\n==Provisions==\n===Settlement of borders===\n[[File:New Mexico Territory, 1852.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of [[New Mexico Territory]] in 1852]]\n[[File:Utah Territory with Deseret Border, vector image - 2011.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Utah Territory is shown in blue and outlined in black. The boundaries of the provisional [[State of Deseret]] are shown with a dotted line.]]\n\nThe general solution that was adopted by the Compromise of 1850 was to transfer a considerable part of the territory claimed by Texas state to the federal government; to organize two new territories formally, the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah, which expressly would be allowed to locally determine whether they would become slave or free territories, to add another free state to the Union (California), to adopt a severe measure to recover slaves who had escaped to a free state or free territory (the Fugitive Slave Law); and to abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. A key provision of each of the laws respectively organizing the Territory of New Mexico and the Territory of Utah was that slavery would be decided by local option, called popular sovereignty. That was an important repudiation of the idea behind the failure to prohibit slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.  However, the admission of California as a free state meant that southerners were giving up their goal of a coast-to-coast belt of slave states.<ref>Not all southerners gave up on the idea. After California's admission, there were several [[Partition_and_secession_in_California#Post-statehood|efforts to divide the state]].  At least one of these enjoyed significant support from southern members of Congress, but the Civil War prevented action on it.</ref>\n\nTexas was allowed to keep the following portions of the disputed land: south of the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]] and south of the [[36\u00b030' parallel north]] and east of the [[103rd meridian west]]. The rest of the disputed land was transferred to the Federal Government. The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) does not permit Congress unilaterally to reduce the territory of any state, so the first part of the Compromise of 1850 had to take the form of an offer to the Texas State Legislature, rather than a unilateral enactment. This ratified the bargain and, in due course, the transfer of a broad swath of land from the state of Texas to the federal government was accomplished. In return for giving up this land, the United States assumed the debts of Texas.\n\nFrom the Mexican Cession, the New Mexico Territory received most of the present-day state of Arizona, most of the western part of the present-day state of New Mexico, and the southern tip of present-day Nevada (south of the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]]). The territory also received most of present-day eastern New Mexico, a portion of present-day Colorado (east of the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]], west of the 103rd meridian, and south of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]]); all of this land had been claimed by Texas.\n\nFrom the Mexican Cession, the Utah Territory received present-day Utah, most of present-day Nevada (everything north of the 37th parallel), a major part of present-day Colorado (everything west of the crest of the Rocky Mountains), and a small part of present-day Wyoming. That included the newly founded colony at [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake]], of [[Brigham Young]]. The Utah Territory also received some land that had claimed by Texas; this land is now part of present-day Colorado that is east of the crest of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n===Fugitive Slave Law===\nOne statute of the Compromise of 1850, enacted September 18, 1850, is informally known as the Fugitive Slave Law, or the Fugitive Slave Act. It bolstered the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]]. The new version of the Fugitive Slave Law required federal judicial officials in all states and federal territories, including in those states and territories in which slavery was prohibited, to assist with the return of escaped slaves to their masters actively in the states and territories permitting slavery. Any [[US Marshals Service|federal marshal]] or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave was liable to a fine of $1000. Law enforcement everywhere in the US had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a [[fugitive slave]] on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. Suspected slaves could neither ask for a jury trial nor testify on their own behalf. Also, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was to be subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1000 fine. Officers capturing a fugitive slave were entitled to a fee for their work.\n\nIn addition to federal officials, the ordinary citizens of free states could be summoned to join a posse and be required to assist in the capture, custody, and/or transportation of the alleged escaped slave.\n\nThe law was so rigorously pro-slavery as to prohibit the admission of the testimony of a person accused of being an escaped slave into evidence at the judicial hearing to determine the status of the accused escaped slave. Thus, if a freedman were claimed to be an escaped slave, they could not resist their return to slavery by truthfully telling their actual history.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act was essential to meet Southern demands. In terms of public opinion in the North, the critical provision was that ordinary citizens were required to aid slave catchers. Many northerners deeply resented that requirement to help slavery personally. Resentment towards the Act continued to heighten tensions between the North and South, which were inflamed further by abolitionists such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Her book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', stressed the horrors of recapturing escaped slaves and outraged Southerners.<ref>Larry Gara, \"The Fugitive Slave Law: A Double Paradox,\" ''Civil War History'', September 1964, vol. 10#3, pp. 229\u2013240</ref>\n\n===End of slave trade in District of Columbia===\nA statute enacted as part of the compromise prohibited the slave trade but allowed slavery itself in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>David L. Lewis, ''District of Columbia: A Bicentennial History'', (W.W. Norton, 1976), 54-56.</ref> Southerners in Congress were unanimous in opposing that provision, which was seen as a concession to the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], but they were outvoted.<ref>Damani Davis, \"Slavery and Emancipation in the Nation'S Capital,\" ''Prologue'', Spring 2010, vol. 42#1, pp. 52\u201359</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n{{see also|Presidency of Franklin Pierce|Origins of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:Map of Free and Slave States.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map of free and slave states {{circa|1856}}]]\n\nPassage of the Compromise of 1850, as it became known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, \"the Union is saved!\" Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \"final settlement\" of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=75\u201376}} The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery.{{sfn|McPherson|pp=121\u2013123}}{{sfn|Smith|p=248}} Not all accepted the Compromise of 1850; a South Carolina newspaper wrote, \"the [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon is passed]] ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.\"{{sfn|Smith|pp=193\u2013194}} Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the fugitive slave law.{{sfn|Smith|p=201}} The debate over slavery in the territories would be re-opened in 1854 through the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]].\n\nMany historians argue that the Compromise played a major role in postponing the American Civil War for a decade, while the Northwest was growing more wealthy and more populous and was being brought into closer relations with the Northeast.<ref>Robert Remini,''The House: A History of the House of Representatives'' (2006) p. 147</ref> During that decade, the Whig Party had completely broken down, to be replaced with the new Republican Party dominant in the North and the Democrats in the South.<ref>Holt, Michael F. ''The Political Crisis of the 1850s'' (1978).</ref>\n\nOthers argue that the Compromise only made more obvious the pre-existing sectional divisions and laid the groundwork for future conflict. They view the Fugitive Slave Law as helping to polarize the US, as shown in the enormous reaction to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Law aroused feelings of bitterness in the North. Furthermore, the Compromise of 1850 led to a breakdown in the spirit of compromise in the United States in the antebellum period, directly before the Civil War. The Compromise exemplifies that spirit, but the deaths of influential senators who worked on the compromise, primarily Henry Clay and [[Daniel Webster]], contributed to the feeling of increasing disparity between the North and South.\n\nThe delay of hostilities for ten years allowed the free economy of the northern states to continue to industrialize. The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily.<ref>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, ''Fruits of Merchant Capital'' (1983).</ref> By 1860, the northern states had added many more miles of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.\n\nAccording to historian Mark Stegmaier, \"The Fugitive Slave Act, the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia, the admission of California as a free state, and even the application of the formula of popular sovereignty to the territories were all less important than the least remembered component of the Compromise of 1850\u2014the statute by which Texas relinquished its claims to much of New Mexico in return for federal assumption of the debts.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RDp6AAAAMAAJ|author=Mark J.

It passed the House in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later, an effort failed to attach the proviso to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].\n* The '''Extension of the Missouri Compromise line''' was proposed by failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by [[William W. Wick]] and then Stephen Douglas to extend the Missouri Compromise line ([[36\u00b030' parallel north]]) west to the Pacific (south of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]]) to allow the possibility of slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, and Southern California. That line was again proposed by the [[Nashville Convention]] of June 1850.\n* '''[[Popular sovereignty]]''', developed by [[Lewis Cass]] and Stephen Douglas as the position of the Democratic Party, was to let each territory decide for itself whether to allow slavery.\n* [[William L. Yancey]]'s '''\"Alabama Platform\"''', endorsed by the Alabama and the Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories by the federal government or territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws.\n* '''Two free states''' were proposed by [[Zachary Taylor]], who served as President from March 1849 to July 1850. As President, he proposed that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the ones today. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or [[organized territory]], which would avoid the question of slavery in the territories.\n* '''Changing Texas's borders''' was proposed by Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in December 1849 or January 1850. Texas's western and northern boundaries would be the [[102nd meridian west]] and the [[34th parallel north]].\n* '''Two southern states''' were proposed by Senator [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], with the assent of Texas, in February 1850. New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the 34th parallel north, including today's [[Texas Panhandle]], while the area to the south, including the southeastern part of today's New Mexico, would be divided at the [[Colorado River of Texas]] into two Southern states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ADJUSTMENT OF THE TEXAS BOUNDARY IN 1850.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNQ1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185|journal=Quarterly of the Texas State Historical Association|date=January 1904|volume=7|author=W.

Variations in coloration occur in the snake's native range, ranging from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish/green or even beige with red, saddle-shaped blotches. They are [[rear-fanged]], have a large head in relation to their body, and can survive for extended periods of time without food.<ref name=\"Fritts, Rodda\"/>\n\n==== Predatory behaviour ====\nThe brown tree snake is a [[generalist and specialist species|generalist]] feeder known to eat a wide variety of foods, when threatened is highly aggressive and tends to lunge and strike the aggressor repeatedly. The snake has numerous teeth, but only the last two on each side of the upper jaw have grooves, which inject venom as it bites. Therefore, the snake's mouth must be opened as wide as possible to insert and expose its fangs. A chewing movement is used by the snake to inject the venom by means of [[capillary action]] along the grooved fangs. The venom is used to subdue and kill prey on which the snake feeds; however, the venom is not considered dangerous to adult humans. In addition to subduing its victim with its venom, the brown tree snake often wraps its body around the prey, like a [[Boa (genus)|constrictor]], to immobilize the prey while chewing and consuming the animal.<ref name=\"Fritts\"/>\n\n==== Native habitat ====\nThe brown tree snake is native to coastal [[Australia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and many islands in northwestern [[Melanesia]].

Upon its introduction the brown tree snake population exploded and spread across the entirety of Guam. The brown tree snake population on the island has reached peak densities of greater than 100 snakes per [[hectare]].<ref name=\"Mortensen\"/> This population spike was caused by the copious amount of resources newly available to the brown tree snake upon its introduction. The limitations on the snake's population in its native range is predominantly food based. The snake's food source is far more limited in its native range than on the island of Guam as the prey in its natural range boasts significantly more natural defences to the snake than the prey on Guam.<ref name=\"Bomford\"/>\n\nThe predominant population affected by the snake's introduction was that of native bird species such as the [[Mariana fruit dove]], the [[Guam flycatcher]], the [[rufous fantail]] and the [[Micronesian myzomela]]. The introduction of the brown tree snake into Guam has resulted in [[extinction]] of twelve native bird species in total. The [[Guam National Wildlife Refuge]] is attempting to prevent the extinction of additional bird species endangered by the snake.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Maxfield| first = Barbara | title = Guam National Wildlife Refuge Draft Comprehensive Conservation Plan Released for Public Review and Comment | publisher = US Fish and Wildlife Service | date = 2009-07-22 | url = http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/HI-PI/Guam/DCCP%20Press%20Release.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-21}}</ref> Other species significantly affected by the invasion of these snakes were small lizards and small mammals.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>  Research has indicated a direct correlation of the spread of these snakes across the island to the decrease in the populations of these native species.

Variations in coloration occur in the snake's native range, ranging from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish/green or even beige with red, saddle-shaped blotches.

The snake has numerous teeth, but only the last two on each side of the upper jaw have grooves, which inject venom as it bites. Therefore, the snake's mouth must be opened as wide as possible to insert and expose its fangs. A chewing movement is used by the snake to inject the venom by means of [[capillary action]] along the grooved fangs. The venom is used to subdue and kill prey on which the snake feeds; however, the venom is not considered dangerous to adult humans.

However, the [[apical consonant|apical]] post-alveolar and laminal palatal stops {{IPA|/\u0288, \u0256, c, \u025f/}} have substantially fricated releases {{IPA|[\u0288\u1db3, \u0256\u1dbc, c\u1d9c\u0327, \u025f\u1da8]}}, and may be better described as sounds between proper stops and affricates.\n\nThe labial approximants are placed in their respective columns following their phonological behaviour (their effects on following vowels), but there is evidence that all members of these series are either [[labial-palatal]] or [[labial-velar]]. {{IPA|/\u0265, \u0265\u030a/}} are sometimes pronounced as weak fricatives {{IPA|[\u0278\u02b2, \u03b2\u02b2]}}.\n\nIn many cases, words with voiced and voiceless approximants are morphologically related, such as {{IPA|/li\u0288/}} \"night\" and {{IPA|/l\u0325i\u0288/}} \"black\". {{IPA|/h/}}- and vowel-initial words have a similar relationship. The voiceless sonorant often marks [[object incorporation]]. However, many roots with voiceless sonorants have no voiced cognate.\n\nThe labialized labials are more precisely labio-velarized labials. There is evidence that non-labialized labial consonants such as {{IPA|/m/}} are [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] {{IPA|/p\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/m\u02b2/}}, ''etc.'', but this is obscured before front vowels.

Long vowels, which are twice as long as short vowels, are written double.\n\n===Consonants===\nIaai has an unusual voicing distinction in its [[sonorant consonant|sonorants]], as well as several [[coronal consonant|coronal]] series.

However, the [[apical consonant|apical]] post-alveolar and laminal palatal stops {{IPA|/\u0288, \u0256, c, \u025f/}} have substantially fricated releases {{IPA|[\u0288\u1db3, \u0256\u1dbc, c\u1d9c\u0327, \u025f\u1da8]}}, and may be better described as sounds between proper stops and affricates.\n\nThe labial approximants are placed in their respective columns following their phonological behaviour (their effects on following vowels), but there is evidence that all members of these series are either [[labial-palatal]] or [[labial-velar]]. {{IPA|/\u0265, \u0265\u030a/}} are sometimes pronounced as weak fricatives {{IPA|[\u0278\u02b2, \u03b2\u02b2]}}.\n\nIn many cases, words with voiced and voiceless approximants are morphologically related, such as {{IPA|/li\u0288/}} \"night\" and {{IPA|/l\u0325i\u0288/}} \"black\". {{IPA|/h/}}- and vowel-initial words have a similar relationship. The voiceless sonorant often marks [[object incorporation]]. However, many roots with voiceless sonorants have no voiced cognate.\n\nThe labialized labials are more precisely labio-velarized labials. There is evidence that non-labialized labial consonants such as {{IPA|/m/}} are [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] {{IPA|/p\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/m\u02b2/}}, ''etc.'', but this is obscured before front vowels. If this turns out to be the situation, it would parallel [[Micronesian languages]] which have no plain labials.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Empty section|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dotte, Anne-Laure (2013), [https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01629074/ ''Le iaai aujourd'hui. \u00c9volutions sociolinguistiques et linguistiques d'une langue kanak de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie (Ouv\u00e9a, \u00celes Loyaut\u00e9)''].
