On 15 September 2000, the song was certified gold record status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], and was certified platinum on 22 July 2013. Various versions of the single were later featured on the German reissue and some UK editions of Ellis-Bextor's debut solo album, ''[[Read My Lips (Sophie Ellis-Bextor album)|Read My Lips]]''. In 2003, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' ranked \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" at number 782 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe track was originally created by [[Spiller]] in early 2000 as an instrumental, with no singing, and was included on the ''Mighty Miami'' EP. It is mainly built upon samples from \"Love Is You\", a disco song originally performed by [[Carol Williams (musician)|Carol Williams]] with the [[Salsoul Orchestra]]. \n\nIn order to make the track more palatable for airplay, as the instrumental is somewhat repetitive, Positiva asked British singer [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], formerly with indie rock band [[theaudience]], to provide lyrics and vocals for the song. Before recording, Ellis-Bextor's lyric was partly reworked by [[Rob Davis (musician)|Rob Davis]], who replaced her hook \"And so it goes... how does it feel so good?\" with \"If this ain't love... why does it feel so good?\", thereby providing the song with its subtitle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2015/04/spiller-groovejet-if-this-aint-love-2/comment-page-1/|title=SPILLER \u2013 \u201cGroovejet (If This Ain\u2019t Love)\u201d -  FreakyTrigger|website=freakytrigger.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[Boris Dlugosch]] produced the vocal portions added to the track.

The booklet write-up correctly predicted it to be a hit.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nIn the UK, the single was first released in the same week as \"[[Out of Your Mind]]\", [[Victoria Beckham]]'s first song since the breakup of her group, the [[Spice Girls]]. \"Out of Your Mind\" held the midweek number one in the UK singles chart until Saturday, when \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" overtook it in sales; it was hyped by the media as a personal battle between the two artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/886316.stm |title=Spiller star slams Posh campaign |work=BBC News |date=2000-08-18 |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/888516.stm |title=Posh suffers chart failure |work=BBC News |date=2000-08-20 |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref> The song was the 8th best selling of 2000 in the UK.

It\u2019s not just any [[disco]] he's reviving, after all. No [[Chic]] for Spiller, none of that poise or aspirational elegance. The sounds 'Groovejet' loots are the syn-drums and ray-gun synths of disco's overripe peak and decline, when it was corny, wonderful, mass-market pop music: you can hear hints of [[Kelly Marie]] or [[Amii Stewart]] in the song, before that sweetness falls back into the dreamy groove. 'Groovejet' is a fond tour of disco when it ruled the world, and proof that it still could.\"<ref name=\"Ewing\" /> He described the music's sophistication as coming from Ellis-Bextor, who \"offsets the track\u2019s bubbly repetition, adds a bittersweet note without ever sounding like she\u2019s above it. In fact she sounds carried along by it.\"<ref name=\"Ewing\">{{cite web|last1=Ewing|first1=Tom|title=SPILLER \u2013 \"Groovejet (If This Ain\u2019t Love)\"|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2015/04/spiller-groovejet-if-this-aint-love-2/|website=Freaky Trigger|accessdate=12 April 2017|date=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video|video]] for the song shows Spiller and Sophie making their way separately around [[Bangkok]]. Spiller meets people and signs autographs, while finding his height makes life there difficult; Sophie sings wistfully at various tables in bars. Spiller takes a [[taxicab]] while Sophie takes a [[tuk-tuk]], and eventually they meet at a nightclub.\n\n==Track listing==\n'''UK CD single'''\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:47\n# \"Groovejet\" \u2013 6:18\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (Solar's Jet Groove Dub Mix) \u2013 8:18\n\n'''UK Cassette single'''\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:47\n# \"Groovejet\" \u2013 6:18\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (Spiller's Extended Vocal Mix) \u2013 7:27\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2000\u20132001)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Australia|1|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|16|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|15|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|13|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/00s/2000/MM-2000-10-07.pdf|title=Top National Sellers|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=17|issue=41|page=15|date=7 October 2000|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n|9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/00s/2000/MM-2000-10-21.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=17|issue=43|page=15|date=21 October 2000|access-date=8 February 2020}}</ref>\n|12\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|6|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|France|17|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|14|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|songid=4448|rowheader=true|accessdate=21 March 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/2000/MM-2000-11-25.pdf|title=Music & Media: Hungary|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=[[Music & Media]]}}</ref>\n|9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://timarit.is/files/12951903.pdf#navpanes=1&view=FitH|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (Vikuna 14.10. - 21.10. 2000 41.

On 15 September 2000, the song was certified gold record status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], and was certified platinum on 22 July 2013. Various versions of the single were later featured on the German reissue and some UK editions of Ellis-Bextor's debut solo album, ''[[Read My Lips (Sophie Ellis-Bextor album)|Read My Lips]]''. In 2003, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' ranked \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" at number 782 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe track was originally created by [[Spiller]] in early 2000 as an instrumental, with no singing, and was included on the ''Mighty Miami'' EP. It is mainly built upon samples from \"Love Is You\", a disco song originally performed by [[Carol Williams (musician)|Carol Williams]] with the [[Salsoul Orchestra]]. \n\nIn order to make the track more palatable for airplay, as the instrumental is somewhat repetitive, Positiva asked British singer [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], formerly with indie rock band [[theaudience]], to provide lyrics and vocals for the song. Before recording, Ellis-Bextor's lyric was partly reworked by [[Rob Davis (musician)|Rob Davis]], who replaced her hook \"And so it goes... how does it feel so good?\" with \"If this ain't love... why does it feel so good?\", thereby providing the song with its subtitle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2015/04/spiller-groovejet-if-this-aint-love-2/comment-page-1/|title=SPILLER \u2013 \u201cGroovejet (If This Ain\u2019t Love)\u201d -  FreakyTrigger|website=freakytrigger.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[Boris Dlugosch]] produced the vocal portions added to the track.

The booklet write-up correctly predicted it to be a hit.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nIn the UK, the single was first released in the same week as \"[[Out of Your Mind]]\", [[Victoria Beckham]]'s first song since the breakup of her group, the [[Spice Girls]]. \"Out of Your Mind\" held the midweek number one in the UK singles chart until Saturday, when \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" overtook it in sales; it was hyped by the media as a personal battle between the two artists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/886316.stm |title=Spiller star slams Posh campaign |work=BBC News |date=2000-08-18 |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/888516.stm |title=Posh suffers chart failure |work=BBC News |date=2000-08-20 |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref> The song was the 8th best selling of 2000 in the UK. A live version of the track appeared as a B-side to Ellis-Bextor's single ''Music Gets The Best of Me'', and in 2003, \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" was re-released as part of [[Positiva]] Records 'Remixed' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Spiller-Groovejet-If-This-Aint-Love/release/203850 |title=Spiller - Groovejet (If This Ain't Love) (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=20 October 2003 |accessdate=1 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe song was ranked at number 486 in [[Pitchfork Media]]'s list of the Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7685-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-500-201/|title=The 200 Best Songs of the 2000s - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, the [[Official Charts Company]] announced that \"Groovejet\" was the biggest-selling [[12\" single|vinyl]] single of the millennium in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-selling-vinyl-singles-and-albums-of-the-millennium-so-far-revealed__8963/|title=The Biggest Selling Vinyl Singles and Albums of the Millennium|last=Copsey|first=Rob|date=16 April 2015|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[Mixmag]]'' included \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" in their list of \"The 30 best vocal house anthems ever\" in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 30 best vocal house anthems ever|url=https://mixmag.net/feature/30-best-vocal-house-anthems-ever|website=Mixmag|accessdate=15 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" has received critical acclaim from critics. Piers Martin of ''[[NME]]'' was favourable, saying \"this is a slip of irresistible ice-filtered summer [[funk]]. This year's '[[Sing It Back]]' and '[[Music Sounds Better with You]]', if you will.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Piers|title=Groovejet (If This Ain\u2019t Love)|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/track/reviews-nme-2914|website=NME|accessdate=12 April 2017|date=2000}}</ref> [[Stylus Magazine]]'s Dom Passantino rated the single 8/10, describing the song as \"[[handbag house]]'s last hurrah, except we'd stopped drinking [[Hooper's Hooch|Hooch]] by then and it was all about [[sambucca]]...\"<ref name=\"stylusmagazine.com\"/>\n\nTom Ewing of ''[[Freaky Trigger]]'' rated the single 9/10, saying: \"There's a beautiful tension in 'Groovejet', an apt flirtation between Bextor\u2019s languid, cut-glass vocals and the delightful indulgence of Spiller\u2019s music. It\u2019s not just any [[disco]] he's reviving, after all. No [[Chic]] for Spiller, none of that poise or aspirational elegance. The sounds 'Groovejet' loots are the syn-drums and ray-gun synths of disco's overripe peak and decline, when it was corny, wonderful, mass-market pop music: you can hear hints of [[Kelly Marie]] or [[Amii Stewart]] in the song, before that sweetness falls back into the dreamy groove. 'Groovejet' is a fond tour of disco when it ruled the world, and proof that it still could.\"<ref name=\"Ewing\" /> He described the music's sophistication as coming from Ellis-Bextor, who \"offsets the track\u2019s bubbly repetition, adds a bittersweet note without ever sounding like she\u2019s above it. In fact she sounds carried along by it.\"<ref name=\"Ewing\">{{cite web|last1=Ewing|first1=Tom|title=SPILLER \u2013 \"Groovejet (If This Ain\u2019t Love)\"|url=http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2015/04/spiller-groovejet-if-this-aint-love-2/|website=Freaky Trigger|accessdate=12 April 2017|date=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video|video]] for the song shows Spiller and Sophie making their way separately around [[Bangkok]]. Spiller meets people and signs autographs, while finding his height makes life there difficult; Sophie sings wistfully at various tables in bars. Spiller takes a [[taxicab]] while Sophie takes a [[tuk-tuk]], and eventually they meet at a nightclub.\n\n==Track listing==\n'''UK CD single'''\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:47\n# \"Groovejet\" \u2013 6:18\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (Solar's Jet Groove Dub Mix) \u2013 8:18\n\n'''UK Cassette single'''\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:47\n# \"Groovejet\" \u2013 6:18\n# \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" (Spiller's Extended Vocal Mix) \u2013 7:27\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (2000\u20132001)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Australia|1|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|16|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|15|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|13|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/00s/2000/MM-2000-10-07.pdf|title=Top National Sellers|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=17|issue=41|page=15|date=7 October 2000|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n|9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/00s/2000/MM-2000-10-21.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=17|issue=43|page=15|date=21 October 2000|access-date=8 February 2020}}</ref>\n|12\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|6|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|France|17|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|14|artist=Spiller|song=Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|songid=4448|rowheader=true|accessdate=21 March 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/2000/MM-2000-11-25.pdf|title=Music & Media: Hungary|accessdate=1 May 2018|work=[[Music & Media]]}}</ref>\n|9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://timarit.is/files/12951903.pdf#navpanes=1&view=FitH|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (Vikuna 14.10. - 21.10. 2000 41.

He currently drives for [[Dale Coyne Racing]] with [[Team Goh]] in the [[2020 IndyCar Series|IndyCar Series]]. He became the first Spanish racing driver to win a GP3 race when he took the victory of the final round of his debut season, held at the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] of [[Abu Dhabi]], in 2015.\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Karting===\nBorn in [[Sant Antoni de Vilamajor]], Palou began [[karting]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexpalou.com/en/about-alex/|title=About Alex|work=alexpalou.com|publisher=Alex Palou|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> His biggest karting achievement was the championship title in the WSK Euro Series in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/wsk-euro-series---kf3/2012/|title=WSK Euro Series&nbsp;\u2014 KF3 2012 standings|work=driverdb.com|publisher=Driver Database|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Euroformula Open===\nPalou made his [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel racing]] debut, competing in the [[Euroformula Open Championship]] with [[Campos Racing]] in [[2014 Euroformula Open season|2014]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.paddockscout.com/palou-secures-full-time-drive-with-campos-racing/|title=Palou secures full-time drive with Campos Racing|last=David|first=Gruz|date=22 April 2014|publisher=Paddock Scout|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> He bookended the season, winning the opening race at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and the final race at [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya]]. He also won a race at the Hungaroring to finish third in the series standings, missing out on the runner-up placing by just one point to Artur Janosz.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.paddockscout.com/palou-wins-to-end-euroformula-open-season-in-style/|title=Palou wins to end Euroformula Open season in style|last=David|first=Gruz|date=2 November 2014|publisher=Paddock Scout|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== GP3 Series ===\n\n==== 2015 ====\nIn [[2015 GP3 Series season|2015]], Palou graduated to the GP3 Series with Campos Racing. During the first half of the season he suffered major reliability issues as well as some driving mistakes due to his lack of experience, but his results improved along the season and he closed the year with a victory at Abu Dhabi.\n\nAt the [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya]] of [[Spain]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Banderas y decepciones|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-el-estreno-en-montmelo-910628|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou qualified fourth for the first race, but he slipped the clutch at the start and lost any opportunity to fight for the points. He made another bad start at the second race.\n\nAt the [[Red Bull Ring]] of [[Austria]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Toca hacer autocr\u00edtica tras Austria|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-toca-hacer-autocritica-tras-austria-911756|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou had another bad weekend. Starting from third, he stalled the engine at the start. He later admitted he felt nervous after the mistakes from Barcelona and that that might have contributed to those new errors. He did not finish the second race because of a crash at the first lap.\n\nAt the [[Silverstone Circuit]] of [[England]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: La remontada de Silverstone|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-la-remontada-de-silverstone-912180|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> a gear-box sensor failed when Palou was driving fifth. He was forced to retire and subsequently had to start the second race from the last place of the grid. He managed to overtake eleven cars, eight of them in the first lap, to finish 13th.\n\nAt the [[Hungaroring]] from [[Hungary]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Motivaci\u00f3n intacta pese a todo|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-motivacion-intacta-pese-todo-912753|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou started seventh and moved up to fifth until a car hit hin from behind. He suffered a puncture and was forced to pit. Starting from the bottom of the grid for the second race, he wrapped up the weekend with an 18th place.\n\nAt the [[Spa-Francorchamps]] Circuit from [[Belgium]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Puntos en Spa, fuerza para Campos Racing|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-puntos-en-spa-fuerza-para-campos-racing-913393|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou scored his first points in GP3 as the season passed its halfway point. Struggling with tyre wear and lack of speed, the Campos Racing driver finished in 7th place in the first race. He led most part of the second race, but eventually fell back to fifth because of the lack of top speed. He later argued that Esteban Ocon was scrapping 0,5 seconds par lap just in the first sector, where the Kemmel Straight was found.\n\nAt the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Autodromo Nazionale di Monza]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Luchar en Monza sin velocidad punta|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-luchar-en-monza-sin-velocidad-punta-913759|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> from [[Italy]], Palou had another difficult weekend because of the lack of top speed. Using the same engine he raced in Belgium, he managed to finish seventh in the first race and subsequently started the second one from the front row. He made \"The Great Mistake\" (as he wrote in his column) when during the warm-up lap he spun at the main straight and nearly hit the wall. Although his car was not damaged, he fell back to tenth.\n\nAt the [[Sochi Autodrom]] from [[Russia]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Ahora s\u00ed que vamos por el camino correcto|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-ahora-si-que-vamos-por-el-camino-correcto-914820|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou received a new engine that solved the top speed problems he suffered in Belgium and Italy. Because of [[Carlos Sainz, Jr.|Carlos Sainz]] crash during [[Russian Grand Prix]] Free Practice 3, the first race of the weekend was moved to Sunday. Palou qualified just a tenth away from Pole Position and scored a provisional season high in the first race when he crossed the line in fourth place. He immediately scored a provisional season high when he crossed the line in fourth place. He was ninth in the second one.\n\nAt the [[Bahrain International Circuit]] of [[Bahrain]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Calma ante todos los problemas de 2015|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-calma-ante-todos-los-problemas-de-2015-916001|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou suffered yet again more reliability issues. He started from fourth, but during the warm-up lap a gas sensor failed and the car kept on accelerating when the driver lifted the throttle. He decided to enter the Pit-Lane and retire. Because of this, he started the second race from the last place. He gained 14 positions, but ended up tenth and outside from the points.\n\nAt the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] from [[Abu Dhabi]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Una victoria para todo el mundo|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-una-victoria-para-todo-el-mundo-916282|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou won his race in GP3 and became the first Spanish driver to ever get a victory in the series. After being eighth in the first race, he held Pole Position for the second one. Worried about tyre wear, he targeted for a podium finish. He held the lead at the start and slowly started to pull away from the field. He crossed the line with a 4.4 second margin to Carlin's Antonio Fuoco.\n\n==== 2016 ====\nPalou continued to race for Campos Racing in his second season in GP3. He scored a second place at the Silverstone sprint race and a fifth place at the Yas Marina sprint race. He ranked 15th in the overall standings.\n\n=== 2017 ===\nPalou moved to Japan in 2017 to compete in [[2017 Japanese Formula 3 Championship|Japanese Formula 3]] for Threebond with Drago Corse. He won three races but finished the year third in the championship behind Mitsunori Takaboshi and Sho Tsuboi.\n\nPalou also raced with [[Teo Mart\u00edn Motorsport]] in three rounds of the [[2017 World Series Formula V8 3.5]] championship, where he won three poles and a race. This partial season earned him 10th in the championship. Palou finished 2017 with [[Campos Racing]] in two [[2017 FIA Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] rounds, where he scored 5 points. Palou led the majority of the [[2017 Jerez FIA Formula 2 round|Jerez sprint race]] from reverse grid pole, but ultimately, he could not hang on to the lead with his heavily worn tires and finished 8th. These two rounds finished Palou 21st in the championship.\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\nIn 2018, Palou returned to Europe full-time for a full season with [[Hitech Racing|Hitech Bullfrog GP]] in the [[2018 FIA Formula 3 European Championship]]. He scored 7 podiums and ended the year 7th in the championship.\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\nPalou moved back to Japan in 2019 to compete full-time with [[Team Goh|McLaren Customer Racing Japan]] in the [[2019 Super GT Series|Super GT]] GT300 class and [[Nakajima Racing|TCS Nakajima Racing]] in [[2019 Super Formula Championship|Super Formula]]. In Super GT, Palou was partnered with [[2004 24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Seiji Ara]]. As a team, they scored one podium at [[Autopolis]] but ultimately finished 15th in the championship. In Super Formula, Palou had far more success. He won at [[Fuji Speedway]] from pole position and, after qualifying on pole at the final round at [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]], he looked to be the championship favorite. A problem with the ventilation duct early in the race immensely slowed Palou's car down and he finished 19th in the race. This dropped him to 3rd in the championship in the end.\n\nPalou also tested an [[IndyCar]] in July 2019 with [[Dale Coyne Racing]] at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://racer.com/2019/07/31/spains-palou-tests-with-coyne/|title=Spain\u2019s Palou tests with Coyne|work=RACER.com|publisher=[[Racer (magazine)|RACER]]|date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> \n\n=== 2020 ===\n\nOn December 19, 2019, it was announced that Palou would move to the [[2020 IndyCar Series|IndyCar Series]] for a rookie campaign with [[Dale Coyne Racing]] with [[Team Goh]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dalecoyneracing.com/2019/12/19/alex-palou-joins-dale-coyne-racing-with-team-goh-for-2020-indycar-season/|title=Alex Palou joins Dale Coyne Racing with Team Goh for 2020 IndyCar Season|work=Dalecoyneracing.com|publisher=[[Dale Coyne Racing]]|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!

He became the first Spanish racing driver to win a GP3 race when he took the victory of the final round of his debut season, held at the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] of [[Abu Dhabi]], in 2015.\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===Karting===\nBorn in [[Sant Antoni de Vilamajor]], Palou began [[karting]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexpalou.com/en/about-alex/|title=About Alex|work=alexpalou.com|publisher=Alex Palou|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> His biggest karting achievement was the championship title in the WSK Euro Series in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.driverdb.com/championships/standings/wsk-euro-series---kf3/2012/|title=WSK Euro Series&nbsp;\u2014 KF3 2012 standings|work=driverdb.com|publisher=Driver Database|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Euroformula Open===\nPalou made his [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel racing]] debut, competing in the [[Euroformula Open Championship]] with [[Campos Racing]] in [[2014 Euroformula Open season|2014]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.paddockscout.com/palou-secures-full-time-drive-with-campos-racing/|title=Palou secures full-time drive with Campos Racing|last=David|first=Gruz|date=22 April 2014|publisher=Paddock Scout|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> He bookended the season, winning the opening race at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and the final race at [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya]].

During the first half of the season he suffered major reliability issues as well as some driving mistakes due to his lack of experience, but his results improved along the season and he closed the year with a victory at Abu Dhabi.\n\nAt the [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya]] of [[Spain]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Banderas y decepciones|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-el-estreno-en-montmelo-910628|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou qualified fourth for the first race, but he slipped the clutch at the start and lost any opportunity to fight for the points. He made another bad start at the second race.\n\nAt the [[Red Bull Ring]] of [[Austria]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Toca hacer autocr\u00edtica tras Austria|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-toca-hacer-autocritica-tras-austria-911756|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou had another bad weekend. Starting from third, he stalled the engine at the start. He later admitted he felt nervous after the mistakes from Barcelona and that that might have contributed to those new errors. He did not finish the second race because of a crash at the first lap.\n\nAt the [[Silverstone Circuit]] of [[England]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: La remontada de Silverstone|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-la-remontada-de-silverstone-912180|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> a gear-box sensor failed when Palou was driving fifth. He was forced to retire and subsequently had to start the second race from the last place of the grid. He managed to overtake eleven cars, eight of them in the first lap, to finish 13th.\n\nAt the [[Hungaroring]] from [[Hungary]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Motivaci\u00f3n intacta pese a todo|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-motivacion-intacta-pese-todo-912753|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou started seventh and moved up to fifth until a car hit hin from behind. He suffered a puncture and was forced to pit. Starting from the bottom of the grid for the second race, he wrapped up the weekend with an 18th place.\n\nAt the [[Spa-Francorchamps]] Circuit from [[Belgium]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Puntos en Spa, fuerza para Campos Racing|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-puntos-en-spa-fuerza-para-campos-racing-913393|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou scored his first points in GP3 as the season passed its halfway point. Struggling with tyre wear and lack of speed, the Campos Racing driver finished in 7th place in the first race. He led most part of the second race, but eventually fell back to fifth because of the lack of top speed. He later argued that Esteban Ocon was scrapping 0,5 seconds par lap just in the first sector, where the Kemmel Straight was found.\n\nAt the [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Autodromo Nazionale di Monza]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Luchar en Monza sin velocidad punta|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-luchar-en-monza-sin-velocidad-punta-913759|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> from [[Italy]], Palou had another difficult weekend because of the lack of top speed. Using the same engine he raced in Belgium, he managed to finish seventh in the first race and subsequently started the second one from the front row. He made \"The Great Mistake\" (as he wrote in his column) when during the warm-up lap he spun at the main straight and nearly hit the wall. Although his car was not damaged, he fell back to tenth.\n\nAt the [[Sochi Autodrom]] from [[Russia]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Ahora s\u00ed que vamos por el camino correcto|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-ahora-si-que-vamos-por-el-camino-correcto-914820|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou received a new engine that solved the top speed problems he suffered in Belgium and Italy. Because of [[Carlos Sainz, Jr.|Carlos Sainz]] crash during [[Russian Grand Prix]] Free Practice 3, the first race of the weekend was moved to Sunday. Palou qualified just a tenth away from Pole Position and scored a provisional season high in the first race when he crossed the line in fourth place. He immediately scored a provisional season high when he crossed the line in fourth place. He was ninth in the second one.\n\nAt the [[Bahrain International Circuit]] of [[Bahrain]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Calma ante todos los problemas de 2015|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-calma-ante-todos-los-problemas-de-2015-916001|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou suffered yet again more reliability issues. He started from fourth, but during the warm-up lap a gas sensor failed and the car kept on accelerating when the driver lifted the throttle. He decided to enter the Pit-Lane and retire. Because of this, he started the second race from the last place. He gained 14 positions, but ended up tenth and outside from the points.\n\nAt the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] from [[Abu Dhabi]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = La columna de Alex Palou: Una victoria para todo el mundo|url = http://www.laf1.es/articulos/la-columna-de-alex-palou-una-victoria-para-todo-el-mundo-916282|website = LaF1.es|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Palou won his race in GP3 and became the first Spanish driver to ever get a victory in the series. After being eighth in the first race, he held Pole Position for the second one. Worried about tyre wear, he targeted for a podium finish. He held the lead at the start and slowly started to pull away from the field. He crossed the line with a 4.4 second margin to Carlin's Antonio Fuoco.\n\n==== 2016 ====\nPalou continued to race for Campos Racing in his second season in GP3. He scored a second place at the Silverstone sprint race and a fifth place at the Yas Marina sprint race. He ranked 15th in the overall standings.\n\n=== 2017 ===\nPalou moved to Japan in 2017 to compete in [[2017 Japanese Formula 3 Championship|Japanese Formula 3]] for Threebond with Drago Corse. He won three races but finished the year third in the championship behind Mitsunori Takaboshi and Sho Tsuboi.\n\nPalou also raced with [[Teo Mart\u00edn Motorsport]] in three rounds of the [[2017 World Series Formula V8 3.5]] championship, where he won three poles and a race. This partial season earned him 10th in the championship. Palou finished 2017 with [[Campos Racing]] in two [[2017 FIA Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] rounds, where he scored 5 points. Palou led the majority of the [[2017 Jerez FIA Formula 2 round|Jerez sprint race]] from reverse grid pole, but ultimately, he could not hang on to the lead with his heavily worn tires and finished 8th. These two rounds finished Palou 21st in the championship.\n\n=== 2018 ===\n\nIn 2018, Palou returned to Europe full-time for a full season with [[Hitech Racing|Hitech Bullfrog GP]] in the [[2018 FIA Formula 3 European Championship]]. He scored 7 podiums and ended the year 7th in the championship.\n\n=== 2019 ===\n\nPalou moved back to Japan in 2019 to compete full-time with [[Team Goh|McLaren Customer Racing Japan]] in the [[2019 Super GT Series|Super GT]] GT300 class and [[Nakajima Racing|TCS Nakajima Racing]] in [[2019 Super Formula Championship|Super Formula]]. In Super GT, Palou was partnered with [[2004 24 Hours of Le Mans]] winner [[Seiji Ara]]. As a team, they scored one podium at [[Autopolis]] but ultimately finished 15th in the championship. In Super Formula, Palou had far more success. He won at [[Fuji Speedway]] from pole position and, after qualifying on pole at the final round at [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]], he looked to be the championship favorite. A problem with the ventilation duct early in the race immensely slowed Palou's car down and he finished 19th in the race. This dropped him to 3rd in the championship in the end.\n\nPalou also tested an [[IndyCar]] in July of 2019 with [[Dale Coyne Racing]] at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://racer.com/2019/07/31/spains-palou-tests-with-coyne/|title=Spain\u2019s Palou tests with Coyne|work=RACER.com|publisher=[[Racer (magazine)|RACER]]|date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> \n\n=== 2020 ===\n\nOn December 19, 2019, it was announced that Palou would move to the [[2020 IndyCar Series|IndyCar Series]] for a rookie campaign with [[Dale Coyne Racing]] with [[Team Goh]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dalecoyneracing.com/2019/12/19/alex-palou-joins-dale-coyne-racing-with-team-goh-for-2020-indycar-season/|title=Alex Palou joins Dale Coyne Racing with Team Goh for 2020 IndyCar Season|work=Dalecoyneracing.com|publisher=[[Dale Coyne Racing]]|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career summary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\"\n!

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E.

He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961.

As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to geld the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground.

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline />  He next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />  Five days later, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />  Nonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road.

Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline /> His first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}.

He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services.

With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate.

Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds.

Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>  Hartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130\u2013134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984.

He then became one of the most successful [[Stallion|sires]] of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century]]. As a sire of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]] after winning both the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada, plus the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer followed up a narrow victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion]] with a crooked white [[Horse markings#Facial markings|blaze]] and three white [[Horse markings#Leg markings|socks]].<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian business magnate [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]] and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/><ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> \n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high{{efn|The average height for a Thoroughbred, measured at the [[withers]], is about 16 hands (64 inches)}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Pedigree Analysis: Is Bigger Always Better? |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/108817/pedigree-analysis-is-bigger-always-better |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=5 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good [[Horse conformation|conformation]], Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his [[C$]]25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between 15 and 15.1 hands.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weigh {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlongs]]. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight [[Horse length|lengths]].

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline />  He next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />  Five days later, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity Stakes]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70\u201371</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />  Nonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion. His time of 1:35{{frac|3|5}} for one mile was a new stakes record.<ref name=Remsen>{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Joe |title=Northern Dancer, Despite a Hoof Injury, Sets Stake Record at Aqueduct  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/28/archives/margin-in-remsen-is-two-lengths-northern-dancer-despite-a-hoof.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2019 |date=28 November 1963}}</ref> Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.\"<ref>Hunter, pg.92</ref>\n\nHis record of seven wins from nine starts earned Northern Dancer the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt|Canadian Juvenile Championship]]. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].<ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline /> His first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref> For his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''Daily Racing Form'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race \u2014 Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker instead chose [[Hill Rise]], who had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services.

With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate.

Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Kentucky Derby by a Neck|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref> With the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>  Hartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down [[Bay Street]] was nixed due to the colt's high strung temperament.)<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\" /><ref>Lennox, p. 104</ref> E. P.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer \"zoomed\" past the early leaders, then drew off to win by {{frac|7|1|2}} lengths.

Nine others also became [[Stakes race|stakes winners]], an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127\u2013129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''The Blood-Horse''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland.
