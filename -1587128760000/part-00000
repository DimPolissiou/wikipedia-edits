Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. Each Yuga cycle repeats four yugas (ages) in the following order: Satya Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga.\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nKali Yuga (432,000 * 1) = '''432,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years. When he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. The entire duration of life for the universe is: \n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

The environment is polluted, water and food become scarce. Wealth is heavily diminished. Families become non-existent. The Kali Yuga is the end of cycle and its end marks the start of the Satya Yuga of the next cycle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Duration of the four Yugas==\n[[File:Time Units in Hindu Cosmology.png|left|thumb|Relationship between various time units in Hindu cosmology]]\n\nThe duration of a Yuga cycle is traditionally believed to be 4,320,000 years (12,000 divine years). Some modern scholars believe in a shorter cycle of 24,000 years. Some other scholars believe in a 25,772 year cycle because it coincides with [[axial precession]], [[Astronomical precession]] and another planetary body ([[Planet Nine]])  that influences our solar system. {{Original research|date=February 2020}}However, the traditional timescale is more widely accepted within India.\n\n==The Traditional cycle of Yugas==\n\nThe traditional cycle of the Yugas has been mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] and it is widely accepted since ancient times. The 4th century indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] calculated the beginning of Kali Yuga. Each Yuga cycle repeats four yugas (ages) in the following order: Satya Yuga, Dwapar Yuga, Treta Yuga and Kali Yuga.\n\nSatya Yuga (432,000 * 4) = '''1,728,000 years'''\n\nTreta Yuga (432,000 * 3) = '''1,296,000 years'''\n\nDwapar Yuga (432,000 * 2) = '''864,000 years'''\n\nKali Yuga = '''432,000 years'''\n\nOne Mahayuga is one cycle of the four yugas which lasts for '''4,320,000 years'''. 1000 Mahayugas is equal to one day (kalpa) of Lord [[Brahma]]. His night (kalpa) is of equal duration. So the entire day-night (24 hrs) of Brahma lasts: \n\n4,320,000 * 1000 * 2 = '''8,640,000,000 years'''\n\nLord Brahma lives for 100 of his years which consists of 360-day years. When he passes away the universe ends. When a new Brahma is born, a new universe is created again. The entire duration of life for the universe is: \n\n8,640,000,000 * 360 * 100 = '''311,040,000,000,000 years'''\n\n==The Modern cycle of Yugas==\n\nA shorter calculation is promoted <ref>{{Citation|last=Sadhguru|title=The Great Cycles or 'YUGAS' Isha Fondation Sadhguru|date=2017-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHVNQwO68E|volume=|pages=|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> by modern day spiritual leaders such as [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]] giving the approximate length of yugas as:\n\n* Satya Yuga\u20144800 years\n* Treta Yuga\u20143600 years\n* Dvapara Yuga\u20142400 years\n* Kali Yuga\u20141200 years\n\nThis results in a near 24,000 year cycle differing greatly from the traditional calculations.\n\nThe common belief until Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had analyzed the dating of the Yuga cycles was that the Kali Yuga would last for roughly 432,000 years after the end of the Dwapara Yuga (3102 BCE). It's believed that this originated during the puranic times when the famous astronomer Aryabhatta recalculated the timeline by artificially inflating the traditional 12,000 year figure with a multiplication of 360, which was represented as the number of \"human years\" that make up a single \"divine year\". It is believed that this was likely a purposeful miscalculation due to conflicts with one of the preeminent astronomer of the time [[Brahmagupta]].\n\nHowever, both the Mahabharata (which was used by Aryabhatta in his calculations) and the Manu Smriti have the original value of 12,000 years for one half of the Yuga cycle.\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:<ref name=\"penprase182\" />\n\n*Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=4,000+%2B+400+%2B+400+%3D+4,800+divine+years+(%3D+1,728,000+human+years)#v=onepage&q=4%2C000%20%2B%20400%20%2B%20400%20%3D%204%2C800%20divine%20years%20(%3D%201%2C728%2C000%20human%20years)&f=false|title=Tracing The Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions|page=50|first=Hans|last=Kng|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9780826494238|date=2006-10-31}}</ref>\n*Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*Kali Yuga equals 432,000 human years<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga, equal to 4.32 million human years.<ref name=penprase182>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQHNDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA137|title=The Power of Stars|publisher=Springer|page=182|first=Bryan E.|last=Penprase|isbn=9783319525976|date=2017-05-05}}</ref> According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of [[Brahma]] or 4320 million human years.

The duration of the Satya Yuga is therefore 4,800 \u00d7 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tret\u0101 Yuga is 3,600 \u00d7 360, or 1,296,000 years.

The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full [[Axial precession (astronomy)#Effects|precession of the equinox]], which takes 25,772 years.{{efn|This phenomenon is observed as the stars moving retrograde across the sky at about 50 arc seconds per year, and is thought to produce periods of warm ages and ice ages known as the [[Milankovitch cycle]].}} Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. [[Srimad Bhagavatam]] 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the [[demigod|deva]]s, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\n==Decline==\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n* ''[[Satya Yuga]]'' \u2013  Virtue reigns supreme.

The story starts with a notice on a billboard, claiming the king of Joseon is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately as the new king. However, inside the palace, the king is known to be severely sick and has been secretly treated for the past 10 days. No one was allowed to visit the king, not even the crown prince himself. Late at night, the crown prince sneaks out to visit his father, wanting to know the truth. But instead of his father, he encountered the silhouette of a beastly monster.<ref name=\"Writer and Episduring the ode number\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Hyo-won|title=Netflix Sets Zombie Period Drama 'Kingdom' as Second South Korean Original|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-sets-zombie-period-drama-kingdom-as-second-south-korean-original-983381|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=July 5, 2017|date=June 3, 2017}}</ref> Accompanied by the physician Seo-Bi ([[Bae Doo-na]]), the enigmatic Yeong-Shin ([[Kim Sung-kyu (actor)|Kim Sung-kyu]]), and his personal guard Mu-Yeong ([[Kim Sang-ho (actor)|Kim Sang-ho]]), Prince Lee-Chang must prevent the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang (present-day [[Seoul]]) while addressing the sinister coup masterminded by Minister Cho Hak-ju ([[Ryu Seung-ryong]]) and his family aimed towards his deposition from the throne.\n\nThe second season centers on the advancement of the plague across several provinces. In the lead-up to halting the outbreak, a devastating revelation ensues at Sangju. Upon the arrival of the winter season, the undead hordes now roam freely due to a change in ambient temperature. Fearing the ramifications of an imminent invasion, Prince Lee-Chang attempts to garner support from his allies to stop the undead and reclaim his right to the throne. Unbeknownst to the Prince, another conspiracy for political gain is brewing within the corrupt Haewon Cho Clan. As Queen Consort Cho (Kim Hye-jun) schemes to steal a male newborn to cement as heir to the royal throne, she further orchestrates a last ditch strategy to use the plague against the citizens of Hanyang, if her former plan fails to succeed.

Seo-bi talks him out of it by making him remember his childhood, and they manage to get the worm out. Seo-bi writes in the patient journal that the worm only thrives in cold temperatures, so they stay dormant in summer and spring, water releases the worm from the body, if bitten you either turn into one, or your body temperature drops drastically, and the zombies are more active at night. Seven years later, Beom Pal and Yeong shin are living together in a small shack outside the town's borders. Yeong shin then reveals that the Resurrection plant was not the cause of the worm, it was worms thriving inside the host's body. Yeong shin then explains that a second wave is coming, as a mysterious woman inserts the worm into the now 7 year old king, and a jingling of bells echo throughout the forest where the Crown Prince

invasions of Korea (1592-1598)]], the first season depicts the story of Crown Prince Lee Chang ([[Ju Ji-hoon]]), who becomes embroiled in a coup/political conspiracy and is forced to embark upon a mission to investigate the spread of a mysterious undead plague that has beset the current king and the country's southern provinces. The story starts with a notice on a billboard, claiming the king of Joseon is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately as the new king. However, inside the palace, the king is known to be severely sick and has been secretly treated for the past 10 days. No one was allowed to visit the king, not even the crown prince himself. Late at night, the crown prince sneaks out to visit his father, wanting to know the truth. But instead of his father, he encountered the silhouette of a beastly monster.<ref name=\"Writer and Episduring the ode number\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Hyo-won|title=Netflix Sets Zombie Period Drama 'Kingdom' as Second South Korean Original|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-sets-zombie-period-drama-kingdom-as-second-south-korean-original-983381|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=July 5, 2017|date=June 3, 2017}}</ref> Accompanied by the physician Seo-Bi ([[Bae Doo-na]]), the enigmatic Yeong-Shin ([[Kim Sung-kyu (actor)|Kim Sung-kyu]]), and his personal guard Mu-Yeong ([[Kim Sang-ho (actor)|Kim Sang-ho]]), Prince Lee-Chang must prevent the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang (present-day [[Seoul]]) while addressing the sinister coup masterminded by Minister Cho Hak-ju ([[Ryu Seung-ryong]]) and his family aimed towards his deposition from the throne.\n\nThe second season centers on the advancement of the plague across several provinces. In the lead-up to halting the outbreak, a devastating revelation ensues at Sangju. Upon the arrival of the winter season, the undead hordes now roam freely due to a change in ambient temperature. Fearing the ramifications of an imminent invasion, Prince Lee-Chang attempts to garner support from his allies to stop the undead and reclaim his right to the throne. Unbeknownst to the Prince, another conspiracy for political gain is brewing within the corrupt Haewon Cho Clan. As Queen Consort Cho (Kim Hye-jun) schemes to steal a male newborn to cement as heir to the royal throne, she further orchestrates a last ditch strategy to use the plague against the citizens of Hanyang, if her former plan fails to succeed. As calamity looms among the living, only one question remains. Can the Prince save his people in time and end the political turmoil at the capital or will the plague mark the end of the Joseon dynasty?\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main  ===\n\n*[[Ju Ji-hoon]] as Crown Prince Lee Chang<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hong|first1=Se-young|title=\uc8fc\uc9c0\ud6c8, \uae40\uc740\ud76c \uc2e0\uc791 '\ud0b9\ub364' \ucd9c\uc5f0\ud655\uc815\u2026\ubc30\ub450\ub098\uc640 \ud638\ud761 [\uacf5\uc2dd\uc785\uc7a5]|url=http://sports.donga.com/3/all/20171018/86813956/2|accessdate=February 16, 2018|work=Sports Donga|date=October 18, 2017|language=Korean}}</ref> - the current prince of Joseon, who is caught up in a zombie outbreak, and the betrayal of the royal family.

Prince Chang and his comrades make a plan to cut their palms so that the blood will lure away the zombies from the palace. Meanwhile, Seo-bi and eight other guards are swarmed by the zombies, and Seo-bi takes the baby as the queen is mauled to death. Prince Chang reaches the lake gazebo with the others, and make a plan. Knowing that water weakens the worm, Prince Chang and his comrades will fight to the death and freeze the worms to death. As the zombies kill and bite everyone, Chang shoots the ice, at the cost of a zombie bite, and slams a huge zombie into the ice. As everyone succumbs to drowning, the worms exit Chang, Beom Pal, Yeong Shin, and Chi Rok, as a pan-out shows them leaving, while zombies freeze under the ice. Prince Chang returns to the now destroyed palace, and meets with Seo-bi. However, seeing the baby has been bitten, he lifts his sword, ready to kill it. Seo-bi talks him out of it by making him remember his childhood, and they manage to get the worm out. Seo-bi writes in the patient journal that the worm only thrives in cold temperatures, so they stay dormant in summer and spring, water releases the worm from the body, if bitten you either turn into one, or your body temperature drops drastically, and the zombies are more active at night. Seven years later, Beom Pal and Yeong shin are living together in a small shack outside the town's borders. Yeong shin then reveals that the Resurrection plant was not the cause of the worm, it was worms thriving inside the host's body. Yeong shin then explains that a second wave is coming, as a mysterious woman inserts the worm into the now 7 year old king, and a jingling of bells echo throughout the forest where the Crown Prince Chang, Seo bi, and two other people are revealed to be, as the four brace themselves for the second wave\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn March 5, 2017,

However, racial strife and ideological differences led to its [[Singapore in Malaysia|separation]] to become a sovereign [[city-state]] two years later. With overwhelming parliamentary control at every election, Lee oversaw Singapore's transformation from a British crown colony with a natural deep harbour to a [[Developed country|developed]] country with a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] economy. In the process, he forged a system of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]], highly effective and non-corrupt government and civil service. Many of his policies are now taught at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]]. Lee eschewed [[populist]] policies in favour of long-term social and economic planning. He championed [[meritocracy]] and [[multiracialism]] as governing principles, making English the [[common language]] to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the West, whilst mandating [[bilingualism]] in schools to preserve students' [[mother tongue]] and ethnic identity.\n\nLee's rule was criticised for curtailing civil liberties (media control and limits on public protests) and bringing libel suits against political opponents.

He described his schoolmates at Telok Kurau as generally poor and not very bright. He then attended [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)|Raffles Institution]] in 1935, where he had difficulties keeping up because he met the top 150 students from all over Singapore. Lee joined the [[Scouting|Scouts]] for three years, played [[cricket]], [[tennis]], and [[chess]], and [[debate]]d for the school. He obtained several scholarships, and came top in the School Certificate examinations in 1940, gaining the John Anderson scholarship to attend [[Raffles College]] (now [[Raffles Institution#Former Raffles Institution (High School)|Raffles Institution Junior College]]). Lee's future wife, [[Kwa Geok Choo]], was his classmate and the only girl at Raffles Institution at that time.

After the war, Lee went on to study in England. He briefly attended [[London School of Economics]] as enrolment at the University of Cambridge had already closed. He related that London overwhelmed him and he sought the more pleasant surroundings of Cambridge, where he read law at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam College]]. A fellow Raffles College student introduced him to the Censor of Fitzwilliam House, W. S. Thatcher, who admitted him for the 1947 Lent term. He matriculated in January 1947.\n\nLee graduated First Class in both parts of the Tripos with an exceptional Starred-First for Part II Law in 1949; this placed him at the very top of his cohort, and he was awarded the Fitzwilliam's Whitlock Prize. The college said he was placed above two contemporaries who later became Professors of Law in Cambridge. Lee was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1950. In 1969, he was elected an honorary fellow of Fitzwilliam College and was the most senior of the College's Honorary Fellows for many years. In 1971, Lee gave the Foundation Lecture \u2013 \"East and West: the twain have met\".<ref name=manandhisideas/>\n\n==Early life==\nLee experienced hardship during the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. During the war, Lee learnt Japanese and first worked as a SAS (Singapore Administration Service) officer in Sentosa islands  where he listened to Allied radio stations and wrote down what they were reporting in the ''Hodobu'' office (\u5831\u9053\u90e8&nbsp;\u2013 a Japanese propaganda department).<ref name = \"Time 1999\">{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Terry |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |title=Lee Kuan Yew |newspaper=Time Asia |location=Hong Kong |date=23 August 1999 |quote=Lee Kuan Yew towers over other Asian leaders on the international stage ... |access-date=14 August 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815041902/http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |archive-date=15 August 2004 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Towards the end of the war, by listening to Allied radio stations, he realised the Japanese were losing the war, and fearing that a brutal war would break out in Singapore as the Japanese made their last stand, he made plans to purchase and move to a farm on the [[Cameron Highlands]] with his family. However, a lift-boy in his office told him his file had been taken out by the security department, and he realised he was being followed by Japanese security personnel (which continued for three months), so he abandoned those plans as he knew if he went ahead, he would be in trouble.

Lee gained a widespread reputation through the victory of the trial, the first sedition trial in Colonial post-war Malaya. ''The Straits Times'' on 26 August 1954 proclaimed this a \"tremendous victory for freedom of speech\". At the same time, Lee was accepted by most Singaporeans as the \"hero of high\".

Ong stood as an independent and he won the Hong Lim by-election defeating PAP candidate [[Jek Yeun Thong]], which proved a blow to the PAP for the leaders had campaigned non-stop for Jek but Ong was too popular in the Chinese community and so Jek lost the elections.\n\nLater that year another by-election was held after the death of the incumbent PAP member Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff in the constituency of [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson]] on 15 July 1961 which saw the political return of former [[Labour Front]] chief minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], now [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) leader.\n\nTwo days after the Anson result, Lee assumed full responsibility for the two election setbacks and resigned as prime minister to PAP chairman [[Toh Chin Chye]], only for Toh to reject it.\n\nOn 21 July 1961, Lee then moved a [[motion of confidence]] in his own government five days after the Anson by-election. The motion was agreed to with 27 \"Ayes\", 8 \"Noes\" and 16 abstentions. The members who voted \"No\" included David Marshall and members of the [[Singapore People's Alliance]]. 13 allegedly pro-communist PAP members and 3 members of [[Ong Eng Guan]]'s UPP abstained.\n\nLee's view was that the PAP members who did not vote for his motion would be expelled for breaking ranks and pulling support away to Communist opponents and he did so, sacking the 13 abstainers and reducing his assembly majority to 1. Together with six prominent left-leaning leaders from trade unions, the breakaway members established a new party, the [[Barisan Sosialis]]. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.\n\n===Merger with Malaysia (1963\u20131965)===\n{{main|Singapore in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|Lee Kuan Yew declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore]]\n\n====Lead up to merger====\nIndependence of Singapore from Britain through a merger with the Federation of Malaya had been the PAP's platform since its founding in 1954. The merger was supported both by the non-communists and the communists in the PAP. So when the PAP won a strong mandate in the 1959 General Election, it pursued merger vigorously.\n\nAfter Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] proposed the formation of a federation which would include [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1961, Lee began to campaign for a merger to end British colonial rule. The communists made a startling about-turn and were determined to derail merger, even though they had all along insisted that Malaya and Singapore were one entity. [[Chin Peng]], leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] made it clear that it wished to sabotage merger or delay its implementation at that stage.\n\nLee explained in a series of radio broadcasts in 1961 that the communists and [[Barisan Sosialis]] opposed merger because they wanted to establish control over Singapore so they could subsequently subvert and take over Malaya. The radio talks won over public opinion in favour of merger on the terms proposed by Lee's government. Lee would use the results of [[1962 Singaporean national referendum|a referendum held on 1 September 1962]], in which 70% of the votes were cast in support of his merger proposal, to demonstrate that the people supported his plan; most of the other votes were blank, as Lee had not allowed a \"No\" option.<ref name=\"illusion\">Lennox A. Mills, [https://archive.org/details/southeastasiaill00mill/page/59 <!-- quote=lee kuan yew vote 1962 blank. --> ''Southeast Asia: Illusion and Reality in Politics and Economics''], University of Minnesota Press, p. 60.</ref>\n\n====Operation Coldstore====\n{{main|Operation Coldstore}}\nBy 1962, it was clear that the Malayan government considered the arrests of Singapore's left-wing groups, which they perceived as communist breeding grounds, as one of the two pre-conditions for the creation of Malaysia.<ref name=\":2\" /> The debates over the specifics of the arrests resulted in a power struggle in 1961 between the British, Singapore and Malayan leaders. In February 1962, the Malayans insisted on the apprehension of opposition leaders in Singapore and warned that they would pull out from the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Council]] if their requests were ignored.<ref name=\":3\" />Observing that the Malayans were pushing for an arrest programme, Lee Kuan Yew jumped onto the bandwagon in March 1962.<ref name=\":2\" />The arrests were scheduled for 16 December 1962 at 0200 hours but shortly before the scheduled date Lee Kuan Yew expanded the list of arrestees to include Malayan parliamentarians Lim Kean Siew and [[Ahmad Boestaman]] because they were opposed to merger.<ref name=\":2\" /> Lee also wanted the Malayan government to assume joint responsibility for the arrests and even composed a draft public statement for them to present in the federal parliament.<ref name=\":1\" /> Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] rejected Lee's demands on the grounds that insufficient evidence existed to justify the arrest of the Malayan parliamentarians.<ref name=\":1\" /> In January 1963, the Tunku was alarmed when Lee Kuan Yew continued to expand the arrest list to include \"some members of Marshall's and Ong's parties\" despite \"protestations of Singapore Special Branch.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Nevertheless, on 18 January 1963, the Malayan government agreed on the specifics of the arrests \"except for two matters... the UPP members and the proposal that Lim be offered by Lee the opportunity to leave Singapore after the arrest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nHowever, Tunku warned [[Geofroy Tory]], the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaysia|British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur]] on 30 January 1963, that 'if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off'<ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. Tory, in turn warned everyone else, particularly his British colleagues and especially Lord Selkirk, to put their reservations aside as 'this was positively the last time' <ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. All parties finally agreed to proceed, and 2 February 1963 was selected for the commencement of Operation Coldstore. 113 were detained including [[Lim Chin Siong]] and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis.\n\n====From merger to separation====\n{{seealso|PAP-UMNO relations}}\nOn 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of the new Federation of Malaysia. The [[Barisan Sosialis]] was the [[People's Action Party]]'s strongest contenders in politics. However, Operation Coldstore had substantially weakened the Barisan as most of its key personnel had been detained. According to Matthew Jones, \"the Barisan never recovered from the combined effects of the outcome of the referendum result and the 'Cold Store' detentions.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> Jones also highlights that numerous Barisan leaders and members were bogged down with lawsuits and its followers were \"demoralised\".<ref name=\":2\" /> In the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 election]] held on 21 September, 5 days after the merger, Lee's PAP defeated Barisan Sosialis in a landslide victory.\n\nHowever, the Singapore's union with Malaysia was short-lived. The Malaysian central government, ruled by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), became worried by the inclusion of Singapore's Chinese majority and the political challenge of the PAP in Malaysia. UMNO's coalition partner, the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) feared that the PAP would replace them, and opposed the PAP, seeing it as a radical socialist movement. The MCA urged the UMNO to prevent the PAP from becoming too influential. Also, the failure of a [[free trade|common market]] to be set up between the Federation and Singapore, and the heavy tax burden placed on Singapore by the federal government put strain on the relations between Singapore and the Federation.\n\nIn the [[1964 Malaysian general election]], PAP contested 11 federal and 15 state seats, which were mostly urban constituencies with a large ethnic Chinese population and traditional MCA turfs. However, the PAP won only one parliamentary seat by [[Devan Nair]] in [[Bungsar (federal constituency)|Bungsar]], [[Selangor]]. UMNO saw this as spite, and felt threatened by the fact that the PAP had even contested any seats at all, and was alarmed by the seat the PAP managed to win. \n\nThe [[1964 race riots in Singapore]] followed, such as that on 21 July 1964 near Kallang Gasworks in which 23 people were killed and hundreds injured as Chinese and Malays attacked each other. It is still disputed how the riots started, and theories include a bottle being thrown into a Muslim rally by a Chinese, while others have argued that it was started by a Malay. More riots broke out in September 1964, as rioters looted cars and shops, forcing both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee to make public appearances to calm the situation.\n\n====Separation====\n{{seealso|Malaysian Malaysia|Malaysian Solidarity Convention}}\nIn May 1965, PAP formed the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]] with 4 other Malaysian political parties championing the concept of a \"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]\" opposing [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]] of [[Malaysia]]. This article specifically provides special [[Quota Share|quota]]s for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and other [[Demographics of Malaysia#Ethnolinguistic groups|indigenous peoples]] of Malaysia in admission to the public service, awarding of public scholarships, admission to public education institutions and the awarding of trade licences.\n\nSome politicians in the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) thought Malaysian Malaysia threatened the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]]' special position in Malaysia. They considered Lee to be a dangerous and seditious trouble-maker. UMNO supreme council member and future prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. [[Mahathir Mohamad]] called the PAP \u201cpro-Chinese, communist-oriented and positively anti-Malay\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 }}</ref>. The more moderate Tunku was perturbed by the campaign. He thought it would lead to trouble, as he believed that the Malays were not ready to compete without their special privileges.\n\nUnable to resolve the crisis, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from Malaysia, choosing to \"sever all ties with a State Government that showed no measure of loyalty to its Central Government\". Lee refused and tried to work out a compromise, but without success. He was later convinced by [[Goh Keng Swee]] that the secession was inevitable.<ref name=\"asias\">Arthur Cotterell (2014).

Singapore joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, and founded the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 with four other South-East Asian countries. Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] under [[Sukarno]]'s regime.

For example, Lee warned against \"insensitive evangelisation\", by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|title=Public-domain information from the US State Department Country Guide|website=exploitz.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319013143/http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|archivedate=19 March 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Decisions and policies===\n\n====National security====\nThe vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence.

Tourism helped but did not completely resolve the unemployment problem. Together with his economic aide, [[Economic Development Board]] chairman [[Hon Sui Sen]], and in consultation with Dutch economist [[Albert Winsemius]], Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.\n\nAfter years of trial and error, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign investments from [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could woo American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base there. By the 1970s, the arrival of MNCs like [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[General Electric]] laid the foundations, turning Singapore into a major [[electronics]] exporter the following decade.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First \u2013 The Singapore Story (1965\u20132000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 80\u201381] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 }}</ref> Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign MNCs.

However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by [[Water conflicts between Malaysia and Singapore|threatening to cut off supply]]. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974.<ref name=\"water\">Tortajada, Cecilia; Joshi, Yugal; Biswas, Asit K.(2013).

Routledge. p. 26.</ref> However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand for the reservoirs for potable water.\n\nThe [[Singapore International Water Week]] was started in 2008; it focused on sustainable water solutions for cities. The Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize was introduced in recognition given to outstanding contributions towards solving the global water crisis. The prize has become an international award given out to individuals and groups worldwide.\n\n===Relations with Malaysia===\n\n====Mahathir Mohamad====\nLee looked forward to improving relationships with [[Mahathir Mohamad]] upon the latter's promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Lee invited Mahathir (through Singapore President [[Devan Nair]]) to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then [[UMNO]]'s Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]]; in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of [[Malay Singaporeans]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to build the Linggui dam on the [[Johor River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|title=Singapore-Malaysia water agreements|author=National Library Board, Singapore|website=nl.sg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609063811/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|archivedate=9 June 2012}}</ref> Lee said he had made more progress solving bilateral issues with Dr\u00a0Mahathir from 1981 to 1990 than in the previous 12 years with the latter\u2019s two\u00a0predecessors, Tun [[Abdul Razak]] and Tun [[Hussein Onn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 }}</ref>Mahathir ordered the lifting of the ban on the export of construction materials to Singapore in 1981, agreed to sort out Malaysia\u2019s claim to [[Pedra Branca]] island and affirmed it would honour the 1962 Water Agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nOne day before Lee left office in November 1990, Malaysia and Singapore signed the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990]].  [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|Malayan Railways (KTM)]] would vacate the [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] and move to [[Bukit Timah railway station|Bukit Timah]] while all KTM's land between Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar would revert to Singapore. Railway land at Tanjong Pagar would be handed over to a private limited company for joint development of which its equity would be split 60% to Malaysia and 40% to Singapore. However, Prime Minister Mahathir expressed his displeasure with the POA as it failed to include a piece of railway land in Bukit Timah for joint development in 1993. It was only in 2010 when the matter was resolved under Malaysia's [[Najib Razak]] and Lee's son, [[Lee Hsien Loong]].\n\nFollowing Lee's death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while \"I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence.

In one of his parliamentary speeches, he said: \"Singaporeans must learn to juggle English and Mandarin\". Subsequently, in December 2004, Lee stepped down to another level, becoming a minister mentor and a year-long campaign called \"{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u8bed Cool!}}\" (Huayu Cool!) was launched, in an attempt to attract young viewers to learn and speak Mandarin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |script-title=zh:\u534e\u8bed Cool! |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212155239/http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |archivedate=12 December 2009 |work=[[Zaobao]] |date=7 December 2004 |language=zh-sg}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2005, Lee published a book, ''Keeping My Mandarin Alive'', documenting his decades of effort to master Mandarin, a language that he said he had to re-learn due to disuse:\n<blockquote>[B]ecause I don't use it so much, therefore it gets disused and there's language loss. Then I have to revive it. It's a terrible problem because learning it in adult life, it hasn't got the same roots in your memory.</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed the need to have a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:\n<blockquote>In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did. [...] My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and so it goes on.

She asked if the current censorship rules in Singapore were too equivocal and where censorship was headed in the next two decades. Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress [[Annabel Chong]] which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture.

Michael Barr in his book ''The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power'' claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite how the government presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic Chinese, leaving the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless. According to Barr, the entire process of selecting and grooming of future political and economic talent is monopolised in the hands of the ruling People's Action Party, which Lee himself founded with a handful of other British-educated ethnic Chinese that he met in his days at Cambridge.<ref>Barr, M.

He also remarked that Lee is \"an increasingly self-righteous know-all\", surrounded by \"department store dummies\". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.<ref>''Lee v. Globe and Mail'' (2001), 6 C.P.C. (5th) 354 (Ont.S.C.J.).</ref>\n\nAccording to Lee's memoirs, Nair was forced to resign as President due to his alleged alcoholism, a charge which Nair denied.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Eugenics===\nIn 1984, the Graduate Mothers' Scheme was launched.

The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' apologised in March that readers of the article may \"infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\". The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Goh (totalling about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to \"dynastic politics\" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media-rights watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking \"libel actions\" against journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/business/media/25times.html?adxnnl=1&ref=global&adxnnlx=1269630126-/pOpabLI8eqVE1l9rvVbZw|title=Times Co.

However, racial strife and ideological differences led to its [[Singapore in Malaysia|separation]] to become a sovereign [[city-state]] two years later. With overwhelming parliamentary control at every election, Lee oversaw Singapore's transformation from a British crown colony with a natural deep harbour to a [[Developed country|developed]] country with a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] economy. In the process, he forged a system of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]], highly effective and non-corrupt government and civil service. Many of his policies are now taught at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]]. Lee eschewed [[populist]] policies in favour of long-term social and economic planning. He championed [[meritocracy]] and [[multiracialism]] as governing principles, making English the [[common language]] to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the West, whilst mandating [[bilingualism]] in schools to preserve students' [[mother tongue]] and ethnic identity.\n\nLee's rule was criticised for curtailing civil liberties (media control and limits on public protests) and bringing libel suits against political opponents.

He described his schoolmates at Telok Kurau as generally poor and not very bright. He then attended [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)|Raffles Institution]] in 1935, where he had difficulties keeping up because he met the top 150 students from all over Singapore. Lee joined the [[Scouting|Scouts]] for three years, played [[cricket]], [[tennis]], and [[chess]], and [[debate]]d for the school. He obtained several scholarships, and came top in the School Certificate examinations in 1940, gaining the John Anderson scholarship to attend [[Raffles College]] (now [[Raffles Institution#Former Raffles Institution (High School)|Raffles Institution Junior College]]). Lee's future wife, [[Kwa Geok Choo]], was his classmate and the only girl at Raffles Institution at that time.

After the war, Lee went on to study in England. He briefly attended [[London School of Economics]] as enrolment at the University of Cambridge had already closed. He related that London overwhelmed him and he sought the more pleasant surroundings of Cambridge, where he read law at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam College]]. A fellow Raffles College student introduced him to the Censor of Fitzwilliam House, W. S. Thatcher, who admitted him for the 1947 Lent term. He matriculated in January 1947.\n\nLee graduated First Class in both parts of the Tripos with an exceptional Starred-First for Part II Law in 1949; this placed him at the very top of his cohort, and he was awarded the Fitzwilliam's Whitlock Prize. The college said he was placed above two contemporaries who later became Professors of Law in Cambridge. Lee was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1950. In 1969, he was elected an honorary fellow of Fitzwilliam College and was the most senior of the College's Honorary Fellows for many years. In 1971, Lee gave the Foundation Lecture \u2013 \"East and West: the twain have met\".<ref name=manandhisideas/>\n\n==Early life==\nLee experienced hardship during the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. During the war, Lee learnt Japanese and first worked as a SAS (Singapore Administration Service) officer in Sentosa islands  where he listened to Allied radio stations and wrote down what they were reporting in the ''Hodobu'' office (\u5831\u9053\u90e8&nbsp;\u2013 a Japanese propaganda department).<ref name = \"Time 1999\">{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Terry |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |title=Lee Kuan Yew |newspaper=Time Asia |location=Hong Kong |date=23 August 1999 |quote=Lee Kuan Yew towers over other Asian leaders on the international stage ... |access-date=14 August 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815041902/http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |archive-date=15 August 2004 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Towards the end of the war, by listening to Allied radio stations, he realised the Japanese were losing the war, and fearing that a brutal war would break out in Singapore as the Japanese made their last stand, he made plans to purchase and move to a farm on the [[Cameron Highlands]] with his family. However, a lift-boy in his office told him his file had been taken out by the security department, and he realised he was being followed by Japanese security personnel (which continued for three months), so he abandoned those plans as he knew if he went ahead, he would be in trouble.

Lee gained a widespread reputation through the victory of the trial, the first sedition trial in Colonial post-war Malaya. ''The Straits Times'' on 26 August 1954 proclaimed this a \"tremendous victory for freedom of speech\". At the same time, Lee was accepted by most Singaporeans as the \"hero of high\".

He had been expelled by the party after making open disputes with his Cabinet colleagues, including over the abolition of the City Council when he was the last Mayor. Two other PAP members had followed him to join his faction and resigned from the party but did not resign their seats with Ong. Ong stood as an independent and he won the Hong Lim by-election defeating PAP candidate [[Jek Yeun Thong]], which proved a blow to the PAP for the leaders had campaigned non-stop for Jek but Ong was too popular in the Chinese community and so Jek lost the elections.\n\nLater that year another by-election was held after the death of the incumbent PAP member Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff in the constituency of [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson]] on 15 July 1961 which saw the political return of former [[Labour Front]] chief minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], now [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) leader.\n\nTwo days after the Anson result, Lee assumed full responsibility for the two election setbacks and resigned as prime minister to PAP chairman [[Toh Chin Chye]], only for Toh to reject it.\n\nOn 21 July 1961, Lee then moved a [[motion of confidence]] in his own government five days after the Anson by-election. The motion was agreed to with 27 \"Ayes\", 8 \"Noes\" and 16 abstentions. The members who voted \"No\" included David Marshall and members of the [[Singapore People's Alliance]]. 13 allegedly pro-communist PAP members and 3 members of [[Ong Eng Guan]]'s UPP abstained.\n\nLee's view was that the PAP members who did not vote for his motion would be expelled for breaking ranks and pulling support away to Communist opponents and he did so, sacking the 13 abstainers and reducing his assembly majority to 1. Together with six prominent left-leaning leaders from trade unions, the breakaway members established a new party, the [[Barisan Sosialis]]. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.\n\n===Merger with Malaysia (1963\u20131965)===\n{{main|Singapore in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|Lee Kuan Yew declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore]]\n\n====Lead up to merger====\nIndependence of Singapore from Britain through a merger with the Federation of Malaya had been the PAP's platform since its founding in 1954. The merger was supported both by the non-communists and the communists in the PAP. So when the PAP won a strong mandate in the 1959 General Election, it pursued merger vigorously.\n\nAfter Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] proposed the formation of a federation which would include [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1961, Lee began to campaign for a merger to end British colonial rule. The communists made a startling about-turn and were determined to derail merger, even though they had all along insisted that Malaya and Singapore were one entity. [[Chin Peng]], leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] made it clear that it wished to sabotage merger or delay its implementation at that stage.\n\nLee explained in a series of radio broadcasts in 1961 that the communists and [[Barisan Sosialis]] opposed merger because they wanted to establish control over Singapore so they could subsequently subvert and take over Malaya. The radio talks won over public opinion in favour of merger on the terms proposed by Lee's government. Lee would use the results of [[1962 Singaporean national referendum|a referendum held on 1 September 1962]], in which 70% of the votes were cast in support of his merger proposal, to demonstrate that the people supported his plan; most of the other votes were blank, as Lee had not allowed a \"No\" option.<ref name=\"illusion\">Lennox A.

In February 1962, the Malayans insisted on the apprehension of opposition leaders in Singapore and warned that they would pull out from the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Council]] if their requests were ignored.<ref name=\":3\" />Observing that the Malayans were pushing for an arrest programme, Lee Kuan Yew jumped onto the bandwagon in March 1962.<ref name=\":2\" />The arrests were scheduled for 16 December 1962 at 0200 hours but shortly before the scheduled date Lee Kuan Yew expanded the list of arrestees to include Malayan parliamentarians Lim Kean Siew and [[Ahmad Boestaman]] because they were opposed to merger.<ref name=\":2\" /> Lee also wanted the Malayan government to assume joint responsibility for the arrests and even composed a draft public statement for them to present in the federal parliament.<ref name=\":1\" /> Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] rejected Lee's demands on the grounds that insufficient evidence existed to justify the arrest of the Malayan parliamentarians.<ref name=\":1\" /> In January 1963, the Tunku was alarmed when Lee Kuan Yew continued to expand the arrest list to include \"some members of Marshall's and Ong's parties\" despite \"protestations of Singapore Special Branch.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Nevertheless, on 18 January 1963, the Malayan government agreed on the specifics of the arrests \"except for two matters... the UPP members and the proposal that Lim be offered by Lee the opportunity to leave Singapore after the arrest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nHowever, Tunku warned [[Geofroy Tory]], the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaysia|British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur]] on 30 January 1963, that 'if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off'<ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. Tory, in turn warned everyone else, particularly his British colleagues and especially Lord Selkirk, to put their reservations aside as 'this was positively the last time' <ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. All parties finally agreed to proceed, and 2 February 1963 was selected for the commencement of Operation Coldstore. 113 were detained including [[Lim Chin Siong]] and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis.\n\n====From merger to separation====\n{{seealso|PAP-UMNO relations}}\nOn 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of the new Federation of Malaysia. The [[Barisan Sosialis]] was the [[People's Action Party]]'s strongest contenders in politics. However, Operation Coldstore had substantially weakened the Barisan as most of its key personnel had been detained. According to Matthew Jones, \"the Barisan never recovered from the combined effects of the outcome of the referendum result and the 'Cold Store' detentions.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> Jones also highlights that numerous Barisan leaders and members were bogged down with lawsuits and its followers were \"demoralised\".<ref name=\":2\" /> In the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 election]] held on 21 September, 5 days after the merger, Lee's PAP defeated Barisan Sosialis in a landslide victory.\n\nHowever, the Singapore's union with Malaysia was short-lived. The Malaysian central government, ruled by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), became worried by the inclusion of Singapore's Chinese majority and the political challenge of the PAP in Malaysia. UMNO's coalition partner, the [[Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) feared that the PAP would replace them, and opposed the PAP, seeing it as a radical socialist movement. The MCA urged the UMNO to prevent the PAP from becoming too influential. Also, the failure of a [[free trade|common market]] to be set up between the Federation and Singapore, and the heavy tax burden placed on Singapore by the federal government put strain on the relations between Singapore and the Federation.\n\nIn the [[1964 Malaysian general election]], PAP contested 11 federal and 15 state seats, which were mostly urban constituencies with a large ethnic Chinese population and traditional MCA turfs. However, the PAP won only one parliamentary seat by [[Devan Nair]] in [[Bungsar (federal constituency)|Bungsar]], [[Selangor]]. UMNO saw this as spite, and felt threatened by the fact that the PAP had even contested any seats at all, and was alarmed by the seat the PAP managed to win. \n\nThe [[1964 race riots in Singapore]] followed, such as that on 21 July 1964 near Kallang Gasworks in which 23 people were killed and hundreds injured as Chinese and Malays attacked each other. It is still disputed how the riots started, and theories include a bottle being thrown into a Muslim rally by a Chinese, while others have argued that it was started by a Malay. More riots broke out in September 1964, as rioters looted cars and shops, forcing both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee to make public appearances to calm the situation.\n\n====Separation====\n{{seealso|Malaysian Malaysia|Malaysian Solidarity Convention}}\nIn May 1965, PAP formed the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]] with 4 other Malaysian political parties championing the concept of a \"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]\" opposing [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]] of [[Malaysia]]. This article specifically provides special [[Quota Share|quota]]s for the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and other [[Demographics of Malaysia#Ethnolinguistic groups|indigenous peoples]] of Malaysia in admission to the public service, awarding of public scholarships, admission to public education institutions and the awarding of trade licences.\n\nSome politicians in the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) thought Malaysian Malaysia threatened the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]]' special position in Malaysia. They considered Lee to be a dangerous and seditious trouble-maker. UMNO supreme council member and future prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. [[Mahathir Mohamad]] called the PAP \u201cpro-Chinese, communist-oriented and positively anti-Malay\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 }}</ref>. The more moderate Tunku was perturbed by the campaign. He thought it would lead to trouble, as he believed that the Malays were not ready to compete without their special privileges.\n\nUnable to resolve the crisis, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from Malaysia, choosing to \"sever all ties with a State Government that showed no measure of loyalty to its Central Government\". Lee refused and tried to work out a compromise, but without success. He was later convinced by [[Goh Keng Swee]] that the secession was inevitable.<ref name=\"asias\">Arthur Cotterell (2014).

Singapore joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, and founded the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 with four other South-East Asian countries. Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] under [[Sukarno]]'s regime.

For example, Lee warned against \"insensitive evangelisation\", by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|title=Public-domain information from the US State Department Country Guide|website=exploitz.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319013143/http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|archivedate=19 March 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Decisions and policies===\n\n====National security====\nThe vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence. He appointed [[Goh Keng Swee]] as [[Minister for the Interior and Defence]] to build up the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) and requested help from other countries, particularly [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan (ROC)]], for advice, training and facilities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 14\u201315, 20, 25\u201326] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 }}</ref> In 1967, Lee introduced conscription whereby all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens age 18 and above are required to serve National Service (NS) either in the Singapore Armed Forces, [[Singapore Police Force]] or the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]].

Tourism helped but did not completely resolve the unemployment problem. Together with his economic aide, [[Economic Development Board]] chairman [[Hon Sui Sen]], and in consultation with Dutch economist [[Albert Winsemius]], Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.\n\nAfter years of trial and error, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign investments from [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could woo American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base there. By the 1970s, the arrival of MNCs like [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[General Electric]] laid the foundations, turning Singapore into a major [[electronics]] exporter the following decade.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First \u2013 The Singapore Story (1965\u20132000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 80\u201381] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 }}</ref> Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign MNCs.

However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by [[Water conflicts between Malaysia and Singapore|threatening to cut off supply]]. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974.<ref name=\"water\">Tortajada, Cecilia; Joshi, Yugal; Biswas, Asit K.(2013).

Routledge. p. 26.</ref> However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand for the reservoirs for potable water.\n\nThe [[Singapore International Water Week]] was started in 2008; it focused on sustainable water solutions for cities. The Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize was introduced in recognition given to outstanding contributions towards solving the global water crisis. The prize has become an international award given out to individuals and groups worldwide.\n\n===Relations with Malaysia===\n\n====Mahathir Mohamad====\nLee looked forward to improving relationships with [[Mahathir Mohamad]] upon the latter's promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Lee invited Mahathir (through Singapore President [[Devan Nair]]) to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then [[UMNO]]'s Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]]; in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of [[Malay Singaporeans]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to build the Linggui dam on the [[Johor River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|title=Singapore-Malaysia water agreements|author=National Library Board, Singapore|website=nl.sg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609063811/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|archivedate=9 June 2012}}</ref> Lee said he had made more progress solving bilateral issues with Dr\u00a0Mahathir from 1981 to 1990 than in the previous 12 years with the latter\u2019s two\u00a0predecessors, Tun [[Abdul Razak]] and Tun [[Hussein Onn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 }}</ref>Mahathir ordered the lifting of the ban on the export of construction materials to Singapore in 1981, agreed to sort out Malaysia\u2019s claim to [[Pedra Branca]] island and affirmed it would honour the 1962 Water Agreement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/close-difficult-relationship-0 |title=A close but difficult relationship |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |access-date=12 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nOne day before Lee left office in November 1990, Malaysia and Singapore signed the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990]].  [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|Malayan Railways (KTM)]] would vacate the [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] and move to [[Bukit Timah railway station|Bukit Timah]] while all KTM's land between Bukit Timah and Tanjong Pagar would revert to Singapore. Railway land at Tanjong Pagar would be handed over to a private limited company for joint development of which its equity would be split 60% to Malaysia and 40% to Singapore. However, Prime Minister Mahathir expressed his displeasure with the POA as it failed to include a piece of railway land in Bukit Timah for joint development in 1993. It was only in 2010 when the matter was resolved under Malaysia's [[Najib Razak]] and Lee's son, [[Lee Hsien Loong]].\n\nFollowing Lee's death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while \"I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence.

In one of his parliamentary speeches, he said: \"Singaporeans must learn to juggle English and Mandarin\". Subsequently, in December 2004, Lee stepped down to another level, becoming a minister mentor and a year-long campaign called \"{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u8bed Cool!}}\" (Huayu Cool!) was launched, in an attempt to attract young viewers to learn and speak Mandarin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |script-title=zh:\u534e\u8bed Cool! |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212155239/http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |archivedate=12 December 2009 |work=[[Zaobao]] |date=7 December 2004 |language=zh-sg}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2005, Lee published a book, ''Keeping My Mandarin Alive'', documenting his decades of effort to master Mandarin, a language that he said he had to re-learn due to disuse:\n<blockquote>[B]ecause I don't use it so much, therefore it gets disused and there's language loss. Then I have to revive it. It's a terrible problem because learning it in adult life, it hasn't got the same roots in your memory.</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed the need to have a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:\n<blockquote>In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did. [...] My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and so it goes on.

Michael Barr in his book ''The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power'' claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite how the government presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic Chinese, leaving the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless. According to Barr, the entire process of selecting and grooming of future political and economic talent is monopolised in the hands of the ruling People's Action Party, which Lee himself founded with a handful of other British-educated ethnic Chinese that he met in his days at Cambridge.<ref>Barr, M.

He also remarked that Lee is \"an increasingly self-righteous know-all\", surrounded by \"department store dummies\". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.<ref>''Lee v.

The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' apologised in March that readers of the article may \"infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\".

The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to \"dynastic politics\" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew.
