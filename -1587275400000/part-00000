It is believed to have been the first hewn log house north of the [[Missouri River]], and its four rooms, stone foundation, double-fireplace, and other [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania German]] construction details set it apart from other homes. The family was of Methodist faith and the first [[Methodism#Sacraments|Methodist sacrament]] in Missouri was in the home in 1807.<ref name=\"ohs\" />\n\nThe home was called \"Zumwalt's Fort\" because area families would gather there for protection from raids during the [[War of 1812]].

The portion that contained the fort was sold to Fred Gentemann who converted it into use as a barn. In September 1929, primarily through efforts by two Heald family members, a commemorative marker was placed along nearby [[U.S. Highway 40#Missouri|U.S. Highway 40]] (now also known as [[Interstate 64 in Missouri|Interstate 64]]) to share the history of the site. In 1936, a state historical group presented resolutions to petition the state legislature to buy {{convert|87|acres}} surrounding the fort for a state park. The following year, funds to expand the state park system were approved and in 1938, the state filed condemnation proceedings to acquire {{convert|40.63|acres}} for the park, which it bought from three owners (including Gentemann) for $9,000 in early 1939.<ref name=Weil>{{cite web |title=Historical Background of Fort Zumwalt |website=O'Fallon Community Foundation |first=Andrew |last=Weil |pages=36\u201339 |access-date=April 10, 2018 |url=http://www.ofalloncommunityfoundation.org/images/stories/Reading/03%20History.pdf#page=36 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, the state park was used mostly by O'Fallon residents, though it gradually became a popular camping and relaxation point for travelers on U.S. 40 (and later [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|Interstate 70]]). The central chimney was rebuilt in 1960, apparently from only reclaimed pieces of the fort's foundations as no stone was ordered for the job.  As part of an [[survey (archaeology)|archaeological survey]] of all its parks, and with initial plans for reconstruction of the fort, the state of Missouri sponsored excavations around parts of the fort for several weeks in 1975, the findings of which suggested the prior presence of a [[smoke house]] and [[blacksmith]]ing activity. In 1978, the state sold the park to the City of O'Fallon for $1, requiring that it continue to be maintained as a public park. In 2005, with permission by the city, the O'Fallon Community Foundation resumed long-delayed plans to restore the fort and hired the Archaeology Research Center of St. Louis to complete excavations around it.<ref name=Weil />\n\n===Reconstruction and legacy===\nAll that remained of the original Zumwalt home as of September 2008 was its internal stone chimney with two fireplaces, one on either side.<ref name=\"wmark\" /> In 2008, the O'Fallon Community Foundation began work on the reconstruction of Zumwalt's home.

It is believed to have been the first hewn log house north of the [[Missouri River]], and its four rooms, stone foundation, double-fireplace, and other [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania German]] construction details set it apart from other homes. The family was of Methodist faith and the first [[Methodism#Sacraments|Methodist sacrament]] in Missouri was in the home in 1807.<ref name=\"ohs\" />\n\nThe home was called \"Zumwalt's Fort\" because area families would gather there for protection from raids during the [[War of 1812]].

The portion that contained the fort was sold to Fred Gentemann who converted it into use as a barn. In September 1929, primarily through efforts by two Heald family members, a commemorative marker was placed along nearby [[U.S. Highway 40#Missouri|U.S. Highway 40]] (now also known as [[Interstate 64 in Missouri|Interstate 64]]) to share the history of the site. In 1936, a state historical group presented resolutions to petition the state legislature to buy {{convert|87|acres}} surrounding the fort for a state park. The following year, funds to expand the state park system were approved and in 1938, the state filed condemnation proceedings to acquire {{convert|40.63|acres}} for the park, which it bought from three owners (including Gentemann) for $9,000 in early 1939.<ref name=Weil>{{cite web |title=Historical Background of Fort Zumwalt |website=O'Fallon Community Foundation |first=Andrew |last=Weil |pages=36\u201339 |access-date=April 10, 2018 |url=http://www.ofalloncommunityfoundation.org/images/stories/Reading/03%20History.pdf#page=36 }}</ref>\n\nInitially, the state park was used mostly by O'Fallon residents, though it gradually became a popular camping and relaxation point for travelers on U.S. 40 (and later [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|Interstate 70]]). The central chimney was rebuilt in 1960, apparently from only reclaimed pieces of the fort's foundations as no stone was ordered for the job.  As part of an [[survey (archaeology)|archaeological survey]] of all its parks, and with initial plans for reconstruction of the fort, the state of Missouri sponsored excavations around parts of the fort for several weeks in 1975, the findings of which suggested the prior presence of a [[smoke house]] and [[blacksmith]]ing activity. In 1978, the state sold the park to the City of O'Fallon for $1, requiring that it continue to be maintained as a public park. In 2005, with permission by the city, the O'Fallon Community Foundation resumed long-delayed plans to restore the fort and hired the Archaeology Research Center of St. Louis to complete excavations around it.<ref name=Weil />\n\nAll that remained of the original Zumwalt home as of September 2008 was its internal stone chimney with two fireplaces, one on either side.<ref name=\"wmark\" /> In 2008, the O'Fallon Community Foundation began work on the reconstruction of Zumwalt's home.

He was one of the  leaders of [[Haskalah]] and the [[Misnagdim]], and was greatly influenced by the Vilna Gaon. He was the [[Av Beit Din]] of [[Slonim]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and is thought to have been descended from Shimshon Loew ben Bezalel, the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]]'s brother through his grandson, [[Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pinkas Slonim [Memorial Book of Slonim]|last=Lichtenstein|first=Kalman|publisher=Irgun \u02bbole Slonim be-Yi\u015bra\u02bcel|year=1961|isbn=|volume=1|location=Tel Aviv|pages=33\u201339}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and early adulthood ==\nNot that much is known about his early life. We do know that he was born in [[Lithuania]], sometime between 1734 and 1736. We also know that around 17 or 18 years of age (1751-1753), he went to [[Hamburg]] to study [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as the seven sciences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Debate Over Secular Studies Among the Disciples of the Vilna Gaon|last=Shuchat|first=B. Raphael|publisher=Torah U-Madda Journal|year=1998|isbn=|volume=8|location=|pages=287}}</ref> After returning from [[Hamburg]], he took jobs as rabbi in the towns of Kolyshki and [[Kr\u0101slava]]. He would make many more trips back to [[Hamburg]] later in his life, so he could buy books.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Marriage and life in Slonim ==\nIn around 1766, Ichile Ginshpriker, son of [[Aryeh Leib Epstein]] arranged for his first cousin, Basha bat Ze'ev Wolf and Shimshon to be married. In 1769, Shimshon got a job in [[Slonim]] as the [[Av Beit Din]] (Chief Rabbinical Judge). He kept this position until around 1791. Shimshon was part of the movement of [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment]]). When he became [[Av Beit Din]] in [[Slonim]], he began to spread [[Haskalah]] to the whole city. He is regarded as the first to do so in [[Slonim]].\n\n=== Shimshon's library ===\nHe had a library of around 250-300 books that he had collected on his journeys to Hamburg and other cities. People like the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Salomon Maimon|Solomon Maimon]] came to Slonim to borrow books from his library. Among Shimshon's prized possessions was the unpublished work by the rabbi, [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], ''Bosmat Bat Shelomoh''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Solomon Maimon's visit ===\nIn the 1770s, a young [[Salomon Maimon|Solomon Maimon]] came from [[Nyasvizh]] to visit the library in search of books on science and medicine. According to Maimon, ''\"As soon as I arrived at the place, I went to the chief rabbi, told him my desire, and begged him earnestly for assistance... He promised to lend me some old German books. The most important among these were an old work on Optics, and Sturm's Physics.\"'' These books inspired Maimon to find \"a key to all secrets of nature\" and look down upon others who didn't know what he knew.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography of Solomon Maimon: The Complete Translation|last=Maimon|first=Solomon|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2019|isbn=0691163855|location=|pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Solomon maimon.gif|thumb|[[Salomon Maimon|Solomon Maimon]]]]\n\n=== Meeting with Baruch Schick of Shklov ===\n\nLater on in 1778, upon the recommendation of the [[Vilna Gaon]], Baruch Schick of Shklov (1744-1808) asked Shimshon to write an approbation to his Hebrew translation of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'', Sefer Oklidus. Shimshon obliged and had much praise for Baruch and his book. Several other rabbis from [[The Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]] contributed an approbation as well. Shimshon's words followed the same theme that Schick wrote, ''\u201cBlessed is your logic, and it will bear forth more blessing, for in your book you have refuted the claims our enemies level against us, saying \u2018where is your wisdom and your learning in the eyes of the nations?\u2019 Jacob will not be ashamed, for the land will be filled with knowledge, as the waters cover the sea.\u201d'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Seductive Science and the Emergence of the Secular Jewish Intellectual|last=Feiner|first=Shmuel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=129}}</ref> What Shimshon was referring to was that [[Jews|Jewish]] people were being thought of as being uneducated and ignorant. What Shimshon wanted to do, was to bring science and other subjects into [[Jews|Jewish]] people's everyday lives, so they could be thought more highly of.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Chronicles and Commentaries: More Explorations of Jewish Life and Learning|last=Segal|first=Eliezer|publisher=Quid Pro Books|year=2015|isbn=9781610278232|location=|pages=|chapter=Non-Euclidean Theocracy}}</ref>[[File:Sefer Oklidus (Euclid's Elements) - Approbation.jpg|thumb|Approbation by Shimshon ben Mordechai of Slonim in Sefer Oklidus (Euclid's Elements Hebrew Translation).]]\n\n=== Jeremy Bentham's visit ===\nIn 1787, the English philosopher, [[Jeremy Bentham]] was going to visit his brother, Samuel in Krichev, when he spent the night in Slonim. As he writes in his journal, all of the inns were full, so he was forced to spend the night with a rabbi that kept a hardware store. He goes on to describe the rabbi's home and that he had two bookcases with \"not fewer than 250 or 300 Vols.\". Bentham also talked about how the rabbi possessed a copy of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' and also a manuscript on astronomy which contained a diagram, that the rabbi told him was his own work. Historians have figured out that this was the same rabbi of Slonim as the one who wrote an approbation to Sefer Oklidus and helped Solomon Maimon's desire for books, Rabbi Shimshon ben Mordechai of Slonim.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Touch of Grace: Studies in Ashkenazi Culture, Woman's History, and the Languages of the Jews Presented to Chava Turniansky|last=Bartal|first=Israel|publisher=Shazar|year=2013|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=215, 221\u2013226|chapter=Jeremy Bentham and Samson of Slonim: Two Book Lovers' Story}}</ref>\n== The fire, leaving for K\u00f6nigsberg, and death ==\nSometime in the late 1780s, after Bentham's visit, a fire started in the thatch roof of Shimshon's house. It eventually consumed everything in his house including all of his books and his own manuscripts. He became stricken with grief. It is said that after the fire, \"Shimshon eulogized his loss in the synagogue and cried bitter tears.\" <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/06/some-notes-about-vilna-gaons-librarian.html|title=On the Main Line: Some notes about the Vilna Gaon's librarian, or, Math is fun.|last=Macdowell|first=Mississippi Fred|date=2011-06-13|website=On the Main Line|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> In 1791, after the fire, he left town for a spot as an [[Av Beit Din]] in the town of K\u00f6nigsberg. By that point, Shimshon was sick and very tired. He only served there for a couple years until his passing in 1794.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Descendants ==\nShimshon's descendants mostly settled in [[Kosava, Belarus|Kosava]]. They adopted the surname, Karelitz after the town of [[Karelichy]]. Some of his most famous descendants were the Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] (Author of the Chazon Ish), Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky|Shmaryahu Yosef Chaim Kanievsky]].<gallery>\nFile:Chazon Ish.jpg|Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (The Chazon Ish)\nFile:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e7\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9\u05e5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d0.jpg|Rabbi Nissim Karelitz\nFile:Chaim Kanievsky.jpg|Rabbi Shmaryahu Yosef Chaim Kanievsky\n</gallery>\n\n== Legacy ==\nAll of Shimshon's books and his own manuscripts were destroyed in the aforementioned fire. This unfortunately limits our ability to hear the voice of Shimshon as a scholar. In his family's tradition he was known as \"a scholar and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]], an astronomer and philosopher, accomplished in all seven sciences, the author of many books, on the [[exoteric]] and the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]], and the chokhmot.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Enlightenment|last=Feiner|first=Shmuel|publisher=University of Penn Press|year=2011|isbn=0812221729|location=United States|pages=24\u201325}}</ref> Shimshon was also remembered for bringing [[Haskalah]] to [[Slonim]] as well as being a very ardent [[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]].<ref name=\":2\" /> He also encouraged bringing education into every Jew's everyday lives.

He was one of the  leaders of [[Haskalah]] and the [[Misnagdim]], and was greatly influenced by the Vilna Gaon. He was the [[Av Beit Din]] of [[Slonim]] and [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and is thought to have been descended from Shimshon Loew ben Bezalel, the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]]'s brother through his grandson, [[Samson ben Pesah Ostropoli]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Pinkas Slonim [Memorial Book of Slonim]|last=Lichtenstein|first=Kalman|publisher=Irgun \u02bbole Slonim be-Yi\u015bra\u02bcel|year=1961|isbn=|volume=1|location=Tel Aviv|pages=33\u201339}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and early adulthood ==\nNot that much is known about his early life. We do know that he was born in [[Lithuania]], sometime between 1734 and 1736. We also know that around 17 or 18 years of age (1751-1753), he went to [[Hamburg]] to study [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as the seven sciences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Debate Over Secular Studies Among the Disciples of the Vilna Gaon|last=Shuchat|first=B.

He would make many more trips back to [[Hamburg]] later in his life, so he could buy books.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Marriage and life in Slonim ==\nIn around 1766, Ichile Ginshpriker, son of [[Aryeh Leib Epstein]] arranged for his first cousin, Basha bat Ze'ev Wolf and Shimshon to be married. In 1769, Shimshon got a job in [[Slonim]] as the [[Av Beit Din]] (Chief Rabbinical Judge). He kept this position until around 1791. Shimshon was part of the movement of [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment]]). When he became [[Av Beit Din]] in [[Slonim]], he began to spread [[Haskalah]] to the whole city. He is regarded as the first to do so in [[Slonim]].\n\n=== Shimshon's library ===\nHe had a library of around 250-300 books that he had collected on his journeys to Hamburg and other cities. People like the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Salomon Maimon|Solomon Maimon]] came to Slonim to borrow books from his library. Among Shimshon's prized possessions was the unpublished work by the rabbi, [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], ''Bosmat Bat Shelomoh''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Solomon Maimon's visit ===\nIn the 1770s, a young [[Salomon Maimon|Solomon Maimon]] came from [[Nyasvizh]] to visit the library in search of books on science and medicine. According to Maimon, ''\"As soon as I arrived at the place, I went to the chief rabbi, told him my desire, and begged him earnestly for assistance... He promised to lend me some old German books. The most important among these were an old work on Optics, and Sturm's Physics.\"'' These books inspired Maimon to find \"a key to all secrets of nature\" and look down upon others who didn't know what he knew.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Autobiography of Solomon Maimon: The Complete Translation|last=Maimon|first=Solomon|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2019|isbn=0691163855|location=|pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Solomon maimon.gif|thumb|[[Salomon Maimon|Solomon Maimon]]]]\n\n=== Meeting with Baruch Schick of Shklov ===\n\nLater on in 1778, upon the recommendation of the [[Vilna Gaon]], Baruch Schick of Shklov (1744-1808) asked Shimshon to write an approbation to his Hebrew translation of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'', Sefer Oklidus. Shimshon obliged and had much praise for Baruch and his book. Several other rabbis from [[The Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]] contributed an approbation as well. Shimshon's words followed the same theme that Schick wrote, ''\u201cBlessed is your logic, and it will bear forth more blessing, for in your book you have refuted the claims our enemies level against us, saying \u2018where is your wisdom and your learning in the eyes of the nations?\u2019 Jacob will not be ashamed, for the land will be filled with knowledge, as the waters cover the sea.\u201d'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Seductive Science and the Emergence of the Secular Jewish Intellectual|last=Feiner|first=Shmuel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=129}}</ref> What Shimshon was referring to was that [[Jews|Jewish]] people were being thought of as being uneducated and ignorant.

As he writes in his journal, all of the inns were full, so he was forced to spend the night with a rabbi that kept a hardware store. He goes on to describe the rabbi's home and that he had two bookcases with \"not fewer than 250 or 300 Vols.\". Bentham also talked about how the rabbi possessed a copy of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' and also a manuscript on astronomy which contained a diagram, that the rabbi told him was his own work. Historians have figured out that this was the same rabbi of Slonim as the one who wrote an approbation to Sefer Oklidus and helped Solomon Maimon's desire for books, Rabbi Shimshon ben Mordechai of Slonim.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Touch of Grace: Studies in Ashkenazi Culture, Woman's History, and the Languages of the Jews Presented to Chava Turniansky|last=Bartal|first=Israel|publisher=Shazar|year=2013|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=215, 221\u2013226|chapter=Jeremy Bentham and Samson of Slonim: Two Book Lovers' Story}}</ref>\n== The fire, leaving for K\u00f6nigsberg, and death ==\nSometime in the late 1780s, after Bentham's visit, a fire started in the thatch roof of Shimshon's house. It eventually consumed everything in his house including all of his books and his own manuscripts. He became stricken with grief. It is said that after the fire, \"Shimshon eulogized his loss in the synagogue and cried bitter tears.\" <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/06/some-notes-about-vilna-gaons-librarian.html|title=On the Main Line: Some notes about the Vilna Gaon's librarian, or, Math is fun.|last=Macdowell|first=Mississippi Fred|date=2011-06-13|website=On the Main Line|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> In 1791, after the fire, he left town for a spot as an [[Av Beit Din]] in the town of K\u00f6nigsberg. By that point, Shimshon was sick and very tired. He only served there for a couple years until his passing in 1794.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Descendants ==\nShimshon's descendants mostly settled in [[Kosava, Belarus|Kosava]]. They adopted the surname, Karelitz after the town of [[Karelichy]]. Some of his most famous descendants were the Rabbi [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]] (Author of the Chazon Ish), Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], and Rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky|Shmaryahu Yosef Chaim Kanievsky]].<gallery>\nFile:Chazon Ish.jpg|Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (The Chazon Ish)\nFile:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e7\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9\u05e5 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d0.jpg|Rabbi Nissim Karelitz\nFile:Chaim Kanievsky.jpg|Rabbi Shmaryahu Yosef Chaim Kanievsky\n</gallery>\n\n== Legacy ==\nAll of Shimshon's books and his own manuscripts were destroyed in the aforementioned fire. This unfortunately limits our ability to hear the voice of Shimshon as a scholar. In his family's tradition he was known as \"a scholar and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]], an astronomer and philosopher, accomplished in all seven sciences, the author of many books, on the [[exoteric]] and the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]], and the chokhmot.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Enlightenment|last=Feiner|first=Shmuel|publisher=University of Penn Press|year=2011|isbn=0812221729|location=United States|pages=24\u201325}}</ref> Shimshon was also remembered for bringing [[Haskalah]] to [[Slonim]] as well as being a very ardent [[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]].<ref name=\":2\" /> He also encouraged bringing education into every Jew's everyday lives.

He also studied in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 1799 he obtained a commission in the [[Royal Irish Artillery]], but a year later, when the corps was incorporated with that of England, he retired, and devoted his attention to [[civil engineering]] and mining. He studied chemistry, mineralogy and mining for two years in London under [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], and afterwards examined the mining districts in various parts of England, [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]].\n\nWhile in [[Cornwall]] he discovered ores of nickel and [[cobalt]] in material that had been rejected as worthless. He completed his studies under [[Robert Jameson]] and others at Edinburgh, was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1807, a member of the newly established [[Geological Society of London]] in 1808, and in the same year he returned to Ireland.\n\nIn 1809, he was appointed by the commissioners to inquire into the nature and extent of the bogs in Ireland, and the means of improving them. In 1812 he was elected Professor of Geology and Mining Engineer to the [[Royal Dublin Society]]. Shortly afterwards he expressed his intention of preparing a geological map of Ireland. During subsequent years he made many surveys and issued many reports on mineral districts in Ireland, and these formed the foundation of his first geological map of the country (1815). He also succeeded [[Richard Kirwan|Dr. Richard Kirwan]] as government inspector of mines in Ireland. In 1822 Griffith became engineer of public works in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]] and [[Limerick]], and was occupied until 1830 in repairing old roads and in laying out many miles of new roads in some of the most inaccessible parts of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1825, he was appointed by the government to carry out a boundary survey of Ireland. He was to mark the boundaries of every county, barony, civil parish and townland in preparation for the first [[Ordnance Survey]]. He was also called upon to assist in the preparation of a parliamentary Bill to provide for the general valuation of Ireland. This Act was passed in 1826, and he was appointed Commissioner of Valuation in 1827, but did not start work until 1830 when the new 6\" maps became available from the Ordnance survey and which he was required to use as provided for by statute. He continued to work on this until 1868. On [[Griffith's valuation]] the various local and public assessments were made.\n\nHis extensive investigations furnished him with ample material for improving his geological map, and the second edition was published in 1835. A third edition on a larger scale (1 in. to 4 m.) was issued under the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1839, and it was further revised in 1855. For this work and his other services to science he was awarded the [[Wollaston medal]] by the Geological Society in 1854. In 1850 he was made chairman of the Irish Board of Works, and in 1858 he was created a baronet. \n\nAfter research in the 20th century, is now known that to a large extent the improvements of detail in the maps which Griffith was praised for and the geological research for Griffith's papers were down to [[Patrick Ganly]], whose pioneering work went entirely uncredited by Griffith.<ref name=\"Kerry Magazine\">{{cite journal|title=Patrick Ganly (1809-1899) and the discovery of way-up in rocks on the Dingle Peninsula|last1=Wyse Jackson|first1=Dr. Patrick N.|volume=7|publisher=Kerry Archaeological and Historical Society|year=1996}}</ref><ref name=\"RGS\">{{cite web|url=https://readinggeology.org.uk/docs/reports/WeekTrips/RGS_Antrim_2012_09.pdf|publisher=Special Proceedings of the Reading Geological Society|last1=Barrett|first1=Barbara|title=Field visit to Antrim, NI, 15th - 22nd September 2012|website=readinggeology.org.uk|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHe died at his residence, 2 Fitzwilliam Place in Dublin, on 22 September 1878 in his 95th year.

This Act was passed in 1826, and he was appointed Commissioner of Valuation in 1827, but did not start work until 1830 when the new 6\" maps became available from the Ordnance survey and which he was required to use as provided for by statute. He continued to work on this until 1868. On [[Griffith's valuation]] the various local and public assessments were made.\n\nHis extensive investigations furnished him with ample material for improving his geological map, and the second edition was published in 1835. A third edition on a larger scale (1 in. to 4 m.) was issued under the [[Board of Ordnance]] in 1839, and it was further revised in 1855. For this work and his other services to science he was awarded the [[Wollaston medal]] by the Geological Society in 1854. In 1850 he was made chairman of the Irish Board of Works, and in 1858 he was created a baronet. \n\nAfter research in the 20th century, is now known that to a large extent the improvements of detail in the maps which Griffith was praised for and the geological research for Griffith's papers were down to [[Patrick Ganly]], whose pioneering work went entirely uncredited by Griffith.<ref name=\"Kerry Magazine\">{{cite journal|title=Patrick Ganly (1809-1899) and the discovery of way-up in rocks on the Dingle Peninsula|last1=Wyse Jackson|first1=Dr. Patrick N.|volume=7|publisher=Kerry Archaeological and Historical Society|year=1996}}</ref><ref name=\"RGS\">{{cite web|url=https://readinggeology.org.uk/docs/reports/WeekTrips/RGS_Antrim_2012_09.pdf|publisher=Special Proceedings of the Reading Geological Society|last1=Barrett|first1=Barbara|title=Field visit to Antrim, NI, 15th - 22nd September 2012|website=readinggeology.org.uk|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHe died at his residence, 2 Fitzwilliam Place in Dublin, on 22 September 1878 in his 95th year.  At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving fellow of the Geological Society of London and was the last survivor of the long-since disbanded Royal Irish Regiment of Artillery. He was buried alongside his wife, Maria Jane (n\u00e9e Waldie m. 21 Sep 1812) in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]], Harold's Cross, Dublin; on his grave is the epitaph: ''Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, Serving the Lord''.\n\n==Family==\n\nIn 1812 he married Maria Jane Waldie of Hendersyde Park in [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]]. They had one son, [Waldie-Griffith baronets|Sir George Richard Waldie-Griffith, 2nd Baronet]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*''Outline of the Geology of Ireland'' (1838)\n*''Notice respecting the Fossils of the Mountain Limestone of Ireland, as compared with those of Great Britain, and also with the Devonian System'' (1842)\n*''A Synopsis of the Characters of the Carboniferous Limestone Fossils of Ireland'' (1844) (with [[Frederick McCoy|F McCoy]])\n*''A Synopsis of the Silurian Fossils of Ireland'' (1846) (with F McCoy)\nSee memoirs in ''Quart.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

He appeared in a total of 11 films directed by Bergman, among which were ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'' (1960) and ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]'' (1961), both winners of the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. He starred in a third winner, [[Bille August]]'s ''[[Pelle the Conqueror]]'' (1987), a quarter-century later.\n\nVon Sydow made his American film debut as [[Jesus Christ]] in [[George Stevens]]'s ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965) and had major parts in the title role in [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), and in [[Sydney Pollack]]'s ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (1975), [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984), [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986), [[Penny Marshall]]'s ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002), [[Julian Schnabel]]'s ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'' (2007), [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010) and [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (2010). He later appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' and in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as the [[Three-eyed Raven]], for which he received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nDuring his career, von Sydow received two [[Academy Award]] nominations for his performances in ''[[Pelle the Conqueror]]'' (1987) and ''[[Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (film)|Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close]]'' (2011).

Christian theologians like [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] legitimized religious persecution to various extents, and during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offences and they also fought wars to impose Christianity on non-Christian populations (or Christian sects whose beliefs they considered heretical). However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority. Many Christians \"look back on the centuries of persecution with a mixture of revulsion and incomprehension.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted during that time]]. Christianity's definition and practice of the concepts of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that in multiple ways.  However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence. <ref name=\u201cStroumsa\u201d>{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

It was an effort to convince pagan readers that Christianity should be allowed into the religious \u2018market-place\u2019 that John North says second century Rome had become.<ref name=\u201cStroumsa\u201d/>  G.Stroumsa says that, on the other hand, Tertullian also knew co-existence meant competition, so he attempted to delegitimize that competition through images of idolatry and Christian identity at the same time.<ref name=\u201cStroumsa\u201d/> It is not known exactly when Tertullian wrote his [[Apologeticus|''Apologeticus pro Christianis'']], but it was during the same era when Irenaeus (130-202 CE) wrote [[Adversus Haereses|''Adversus Haereses'']], and Justin Martyr (100-165) wrote the [[First Apology of Justin Martyr|''First Apology'']] which were both polemics against heretics.  Eric Osborne asserts that Justin Martyr, who is generally attributed with inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought, writes only to answer objections his friends are facing and to defend these friends from ill treatment and even death. He quotes Justin in a letter to the emperor as saying: \"On behalf of those from every race of men who are unjustly hated and ill-treated, being one of them myself.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Eric Francis|title=Justin Martyr|publisher=J.

Encounters between [[Christianity and Paganism|Christians and Pagans]] were sometimes confrontational, and some Christian [[king]]s ([[Charlemagne]], [[Olaf I of Norway]]) were known for their violence against pagans. The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n== Christian Roman doctrine in 4th and 5th century A.D.==\n{{Main|Persecution of Pagans by the Christian Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter he had adopted Christianity following the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], [[Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (together with his co-emperor [[Licinius]]). Since 306 there had already had been several edicts that granted Christians [[religious toleration]] in parts of the Empire, but the Edict of Milan removed all obstacles to the Christian faith and made the Empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship. Constantine supported the church with his patronage; he had an extraordinary number of large [[basilicas]] built for the Christian church, and endowed it with land and other wealth.<ref name=MacMullan49>MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> In doing this, however, he required the Pagans \"to foot the bill\".<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> According to Christian chroniclers it appeared necessary to Constantine \"to teach his subjects to give up their rites (...) and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\"<ref>quoted after MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> which led to the closure of pagan temples due to a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;<ref name=MacMullan50>MacMullan 1984:50.</ref> Constantine I did not need to use force to implement this;<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> his subjects are said to simply have obeyed him out of fear.

However, he changed his mind after he had witnessed how the [[Donatist]]s (a schismatic Christian sect) were \"brought over to the Catholic unity by fear of imperial edicts.\" When Augustine had characterized himself in ''De utilitate credenti'' (392), he said he was ''cupidus veri'', eager for truth.<ref name=\"Flasch168\">Kurt Flasch: ''Augustin - Einf\u00fchrung in sein Denken'' {{in lang|de}}, 3. ed., Reclam, 2003, p.168</ref> But  in his 93. letter he described himself as ''quietis avidus'', needing rest, and gave as reason the agitating Donatist.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> From a position that had trusted the power of philosophical argumentation, Augustine had moved to a position that emphasised the authority of the church.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> Augustine had become convinced of the effectiveness of mild forms of persecution and developed a defence of their use. His authority on this question was undisputed for over a millennium in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name=\"Coffey22\" /> Within this Augustinian consensus there was only disagreement about the extent to which Christians should persecute heretics. Augustine advocated fines, imprisonment, banishment and moderate floggings, but, according to [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], \"would have been horrified by the burning of heretics.\"<ref>quoted after Coffey 2000: 23.</ref> In [[late Antiquity]] those burnings appear very rare indeed, the only certain case being the execution of [[Priscillian]] and six of his followers in 385. This sentence was roundly condemned by bishops like [[Ambrose]], Augustine's mentor.<ref name=Coffey23>Coffey 2000:23.</ref>\n\n===The treatment of heretics===\n{{Further|Christian heresy}}\nWith the adoption of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christianity by Constantine I]] (after [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]], 312), heresy had become a political issue in the late Roman empire. Adherents of unconventional Christian beliefs not covered by the [[Nicene Creed]] like [[Novatianism]] and [[Gnosticism]] were banned from holding meetings,<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />  but the Roman emperor intervened especially in the conflict between orthodox and [[Arianism|Arian]] Christianity, which resulted in the burning of Arian books.<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />\n\nIn contrast to the late antiquity, the execution of heretics was much more easily approved in the late [[Middle Ages]], after the Christianization of Europe was largely completed. The first known case is the burning of fourteen people  at [[Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1022.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In the following centuries groups like the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Waldensians]], [[Catharism|Cathars]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were persecuted throughout Europe. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) codified the theory and practise of persecution.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In its third canon, the council declared: ''\"Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, .. to take an oath that they will strive .. to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church.\"''<ref>Medieval Sourcebook:  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215]</ref>\n\nIn the process of eliminating these heretical movements, Church officials, especially members of the [[Inquisition]], made widespread use of torture to provoke confessions. Heretics who refused to recant their beliefs were hanged or burnt alive.<ref>Sean Martin, The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages, Pocket Essentials, 2005, p.g. 105-120</ref> At the [[Massacre at B\u00e9ziers|Siege of B\u00e9ziers]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (launched to eliminate the Cathars in [[Languedoc]], crusaders under the direction of a papal legate, [[Arnaud Amalric]] killed both Cathars and orthodox Catholics.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg]] | title=Massacre at Monts\u00e9gur.

An example of this would be [[John Jewel]]. In defending the demand for religious uniformity by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he declared: ''\"Queen Elizabeth doth as did [[Moses]], [[Joshua|Josua]], [[David]], [[Solomon|Salomon]], [[Josias]], [[Jehoshaphat|Jesophat]], ...\"'' <ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.31</ref>\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Beginning with the [[Wendish Crusade]], the Church began to sponsor and endorse forced conversion through conquest, something it had hitherto not done.<ref>Haverkamp, Alfred. Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

Christian theologians like [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] legitimized religious persecution to various extents, and during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offences and they also fought wars to impose Christianity on non-Christian populations (or Christian sects whose beliefs they considered heretical). However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority. Many Christians \"look back on the centuries of persecution with a mixture of revulsion and incomprehension.\"<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted during that time]]. Christianity's definition and practice of the concepts of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that in multiple ways.  However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence. <ref name=\u201cStroumsa\u201d>{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

Eric Osborne asserts that Justin Martyr, who is generally attributed with inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought, writes only to answer objections his friends are facing and to defend these friends from ill treatment and even death. He quotes Justin in a letter to the emperor as saying: \"On behalf of those from every race of men who are unjustly hated and ill-treated, being one of them myself.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Eric Francis|title=Justin Martyr|publisher=J.

Encounters between [[Christianity and Paganism|Christians and Pagans]] were sometimes confrontational, and some Christian [[king]]s ([[Charlemagne]], [[Olaf I of Norway]]) were known for their violence against pagans. The [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades.

Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n== Christian Roman doctrine in 4th and 5th century A.D.==\n{{Main|Persecution of Pagans by the Christian Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter he had adopted Christianity following the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]], [[Constantine I]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (together with his co-emperor [[Licinius]]). Since 306 there had already had been several edicts that granted Christians [[religious toleration]] in parts of the Empire, but the Edict of Milan removed all obstacles to the Christian faith and made the Empire officially neutral with regard to religious worship. Constantine supported the church with his patronage; he had an extraordinary number of large [[basilicas]] built for the Christian church, and endowed it with land and other wealth.<ref name=MacMullan49>MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> In doing this, however, he required the Pagans \"to foot the bill\".<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> According to Christian chroniclers it appeared necessary to Constantine \"to teach his subjects to give up their rites (...) and to accustom them to despise their temples and the images contained therein,\"<ref>quoted after MacMullan 1984:49.</ref> which led to the closure of pagan temples due to a lack of support, their wealth flowing to the imperial treasure;<ref name=MacMullan50>MacMullan 1984:50.</ref> Constantine I did not need to use force to implement this;<ref name=\"MacMullan49\" /> his subjects are said to simply have obeyed him out of fear.

However, he changed his mind after he had witnessed how the [[Donatist]]s (a schismatic Christian sect) were \"brought over to the Catholic unity by fear of imperial edicts.\" When Augustine had characterized himself in ''De utilitate credenti'' (392), he said he was ''cupidus veri'', eager for truth.<ref name=\"Flasch168\">Kurt Flasch: ''Augustin - Einf\u00fchrung in sein Denken'' {{in lang|de}}, 3. ed., Reclam, 2003, p.168</ref> But  in his 93. letter he described himself as ''quietis avidus'', needing rest, and gave as reason the agitating Donatist.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> From a position that had trusted the power of philosophical argumentation, Augustine had moved to a position that emphasised the authority of the church.<ref name=\"Flasch168\"/> Augustine had become convinced of the effectiveness of mild forms of persecution and developed a defence of their use. His authority on this question was undisputed for over a millennium in [[Western Christianity]].<ref name=\"Coffey22\" /> Within this Augustinian consensus there was only disagreement about the extent to which Christians should persecute heretics. Augustine advocated fines, imprisonment, banishment and moderate floggings, but, according to [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], \"would have been horrified by the burning of heretics.\"<ref>quoted after Coffey 2000: 23.</ref> In [[late Antiquity]] those burnings appear very rare indeed, the only certain case being the execution of [[Priscillian]] and six of his followers in 385. This sentence was roundly condemned by bishops like [[Ambrose]], Augustine's mentor.<ref name=Coffey23>Coffey 2000:23.</ref>\n\n===The treatment of heretics===\n{{Further|Christian heresy}}\nWith the adoption of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christianity by Constantine I]] (after [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]], 312), heresy had become a political issue in the late Roman empire. Adherents of unconventional Christian beliefs not covered by the [[Nicene Creed]] like [[Novatianism]] and [[Gnosticism]] were banned from holding meetings,<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />  but the Roman emperor intervened especially in the conflict between orthodox and [[Arianism|Arian]] Christianity, which resulted in the burning of Arian books.<ref name=\"Coffey22\" />\n\nIn contrast to the late antiquity, the execution of heretics was much more easily approved in the late [[Middle Ages]], after the Christianization of Europe was largely completed. The first known case is the burning of fourteen people  at [[Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1022.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In the following centuries groups like the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Waldensians]], [[Catharism|Cathars]] and [[Lollardy|Lollards]] were persecuted throughout Europe. The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) codified the theory and practise of persecution.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" /> In its third canon, the council declared: ''\"Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, .. to take an oath that they will strive .. to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church.\"''<ref>Medieval Sourcebook:  [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.html Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV 1215]</ref>\n\nIn the process of eliminating these heretical movements, Church officials, especially members of the [[Inquisition]], made widespread use of torture to provoke confessions. Heretics who refused to recant their beliefs were hanged or burnt alive.<ref>Sean Martin, The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages, Pocket Essentials, 2005, p.g. 105-120</ref> At the [[Massacre at B\u00e9ziers|Siege of B\u00e9ziers]] during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (launched to eliminate the Cathars in [[Languedoc]], crusaders under the direction of a papal legate, [[Arnaud Amalric]] killed both Cathars and orthodox Catholics.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Zo\u00e9 Oldenbourg]] | title=Massacre at Monts\u00e9gur.

An example of this would be [[John Jewel]]. In defending the demand for religious uniformity by [[Elizabeth I of England]], he declared: ''\"Queen Elizabeth doth as did [[Moses]], [[Joshua|Josua]], [[David]], [[Solomon|Salomon]], [[Josias]], [[Jehoshaphat|Jesophat]], ...\"'' <ref>John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.31</ref>\n\n==In the Middle Ages==\nIn the Middle Ages, violent persecution of non-Christians became widely accepted by the Catholic Church within the framework of the [[Crusades]]. These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics. At present, only individuals who are members of the Church of England at the time of the succession may become the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].\n\n==In the United States==\n<!-- see the books by Corrigan and the one by Beneke and Grenda -->\n{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}\nThe Puritan-Whig tradition of toleration did have their greatest effect not in England, but in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that would later form the United States.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\">Coffey 2000: 207.</ref> Notable tolerationists were directly involved in the founding of the colonies.

Voltaire pointed the readers of his ''Trait\u00e9 sur la Tol\u00e9rance'' (1763) specifically to the examples of Carolina and Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/> People like [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]] and [[John Adams]] stood self-consciously in the tradition of Milton, Sidney and Locke, and extended their tolerationism further to also apply to Catholics and atheists.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\">Coffey 2000: 208.</ref> Coffey considers it possible to argue, \"that the tolerationist tradition of seventeenth-century England reached its fulfilment in the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]] and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the American Constitution]].\"<ref name=\"Coffey2000-208\"/>\n\nThat the North American colonies and later the United States provided a refuge for religious minorities from Europe partly explains the higher degree of religiosity in the contemporary United States and the \"unusual sectarian quality of U.S. Protestantism\".<ref name=\"Phillips06-104\">Kevin Phillips (2006): ''American Theocracy.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
