These threats are not evenly distributed throughout their range. In areas where [[deforestation]] is actively occurring, they are mainly threatened by the loss of forest habitat and [[forest degradation]] arising from clear-cutting for [[plantation]] development, unsustainable [[logging]] practices, [[Environmental crime|illegal logging]] both within and outside protected areas, and forest fires.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThe main predator of sun bears throughout its range by far is man. Commercial [[poaching]] of bears for the [[Wildlife trade#Asia and Africa|wildlife trade]] is a considerable threat in most countries. During surveys in [[Kalimantan]] between 1994 and 1997, interviewees admitted to hunting sun bears and indicated that sun bear meat is eaten by indigenous people in several areas in Kalimantan. High consumption of bear parts was reported to occur where [[Japanese people|Japanese]] or [[Koreans|Korean]] expatriate employees of timber companies created a temporary demand. [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM) shops in [[Sarawak]] and Sabah offered sun bear [[gallbladder]]s.

The [[Medal of Honor]] was created during the [[American Civil War]] and is the highest military decoration presented by the [[Government of the United States|United States government]] to a member of its [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]]. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an \"enemy of the [[United States]]\" or an \"opposing foreign force\". Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]].<ref name=\"MOHhistory\">{{Cite web |accessdate=February 9, 2010 |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/faq/pis/med_of_honor.html |work=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |title=A Brief History \u2013 The Medal of Honor |publisher=Department of Defense |date=August 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hYPzrHnl?url=http://www.defenselink.mil/faq/pis/med_of_honor.html |archivedate=June 15, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[World War II]], or the Second World War, was a [[World war|global]] military [[War|conflict]], the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in [[Asia]] in 1937 as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; the other began in [[Europe]] in 1939 with the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>Official military histories in Commonwealth nations refer to the conflict as the Second World War, while the United States' official histories refer to the conflict as World War II. English translations of the official histories of other nations tend to resolve into English as Second World War also, for example ''zweite weltkrieg'' in German. See [[C.P. Stacey]] ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', for example. \"Official\" usage of these terms is giving way to popular usage and the two terms are becoming interchangeable even in formal military history.</ref> This global conflict split the [[Participants in World War II|majority of the world's nations]] into two opposing military alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers]].\n\nThe United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Honolulu]] that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time.\n\nFor actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor.<ref>This number includes seven late awards presented by President Obama on March 18, 2014 and the award to Garlin Murl Conner by President Trump on June 26, 2018.</ref> Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]] during the Clinton administration. Additionally, [[Douglas Albert Munro]] was the only serviceman from the [[United States Coast Guard]] in [[Military history of the United States|United States military history]] to receive the Medal for his actions during the war.\n\nThe earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so \"while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force\" rather than \"enemy\" since the United States was [[neutral country|neutral]] during the events of December 7, 1941. The last action to earn a contemporaneous Medal of Honor prior to the August 15, 1945, [[Victory over Japan Day|end of hostilities]] in World War II, were those of [[Melvin Mayfield]], on July 29, 1945 \u2013 though several honorees may have been cited for their Medal after Mayfield's recognition on May 31, 1946. Additionally, seven [[African Americans]] and twenty-two [[Asian American]] veterans who had received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] during the war were awarded the Medal of Honor in 1997 and 2000 \u2013 most of them posthumously \u2013 after two studies determined that [[Medal of Honor#Past discrimination|racial discrimination]] had caused them to be overlooked at the time.<ref>Niiya, Brian. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Congressional%20Medal%20of%20Honor%20recipients/ Congressional Medal of Honor recipients],\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

Although seriously wounded early in the attack, he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight in the close-range battle until running out of ammunition. When a comrade was wounded while trying to carry him to safety, Baker insisted that he be left behind.

Barfoot (then Tech. Sgt.) moved off alone upon the enemy left flank. He crawled to the proximity of 1 machinegun nest and made a direct hit on it with a hand grenade, killing 2 and wounding 3 Germans. He continued along the German defense line to another machinegun emplacement, and with his tommygun killed 2 and captured 3 soldiers. Members of another enemy machinegun crew then abandoned their position and gave themselves up to Sgt. Barfoot. Leaving the prisoners for his support squad to pick up, he proceeded to mop up positions in the immediate area, capturing more prisoners and bringing his total count to 17. Later that day, after he had reorganized his men and consolidated the newly captured ground, the enemy launched a fierce armored counterattack directly at his platoon positions. Securing a bazooka, Sgt. Barfoot took up an exposed position directly in front of 3 advancing Mark VI tanks. From a distance of 75 yards his first shot destroyed the track of the leading tank, effectively disabling it, while the other 2 changed direction toward the flank. As the crew of the disabled tank dismounted, Sgt. Barfoot killed 3 of them with his tommygun. He continued onward into enemy terrain and destroyed a recently abandoned German fieldpiece with a demolition charge placed in the breech. While returning to his platoon position, Sgt. Barfoot, though greatly fatigued by his Herculean efforts, assisted 2 of his seriously wounded men 1,700 yards to a position of safety. Sgt. Barfoot's extraordinary heroism, demonstration of magnificent valor, and aggressive determination in the face of pointblank fire are a perpetual inspiration to his fellow soldiers.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Barfoot - Native Americans in the United States Army |url=https://www.army.mil/americanindians/barfoot.html |website=www.army.mil |accessdate=9 April 2020 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:44-11-17-MoH-CarltonBarrett.jpg|75px|alt=photo of Barrett holding MoH box.]]\n| {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Carlton W.|Barrett}}}}\n| {{Sort|E-01|[[Private (rank)#United States|Private]]}}\n| near St. Laurent-sur-Mer, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|June|6|format=mdy}}}}\n| Joined the United States Army in Albany, New York, he was a member of, 18th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division.

Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns that fought for the next 48 hours until only Basilone and two other men were still able to continue fighting. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He repaired another machine-gun and personally manned it, holding the defensive line until replacements arrived. With the continuous fighting, ammunition became critically low and supply lines were cut off. Basilone fought through hostile lines and returned with urgently needed ammunition for his gunners.

About eighty Germans advanced under the cover of an artillery barrage in the darkness and were within about 200 yards of the platoon's positions when they were discovered by Johnston who was at his gun. He manned his machine gun and the attack was halted. All during the day, without relief, he remained with his weapon and fired at every target that presented itself. One German worked up the draw so close to the position that the machine gun could not be brought to bear upon him. Johnston drew his pistol and killed him. As the day wore on, it became evident that if the Company was to escape it would have to begin its movement. Not everyone could get out. Johnson volunteered to stay. Afterwards an artillery shell made what almost amounted to a direct hit on Johnston's position and shell fragments penetrated into the left portion of his chest. An examination indicated that he was dying. The rapid advance of large numbers of the Germans prevented any evacuation. A few minutes later one of the last men to withdraw saw Johnston trying to crawl up to his machine gun. At Johnston's request he was helped to his gun and left believing that he was dying. A few minutes later the Company heard the machine gun in action. It continued to fire for about 10 minutes. Afterwards the gun went silent. The Germans passed him as he lay in his position, and, believing him to be dead, stole his shoes. The next day, he painfully worked his way through the German lines to the 180th Regiment, after having been reported by the Company as killed in action. Despite his weakened condition, he gave accurate and vital information about the German positions on the base of which effective firing that was compiled.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:Jones HC NH92307.jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Herbert C.|Jones}}}}{{KIA}}\n| [[United States Navy|Navy]]\n| {{Sort|O-01|[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]}}\n| Pearl Harbor, Hawaii\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1941|December|7|format=mdy}}}}\n|Organized and led a party to supply ammunition to the antiaircraft battery of [[USS California (BB-44)|USS ''California'']] after the mechanical hoists were put out of action when he was fatally wounded by a bomb explosion.

Volunteering to act as a scout, armed with only a rifle, he charged headlong into withering fire, killing 2 Germans and wounding 3 in order to capture a machinegun. Carrying this enemy weapon across an open field through heavy fire, he neutralized 2 more machinegun nests; he then circled behind 4 other Germans, killing them with a burst as they were firing on his company. Spotting another dangerous enemy position to this right, he knelt with the machinegun in his arms and exchanged fire with the Germans until he had killed 2 and wounded 3. The enemy now poured increased mortar and artillery fire on the company's newly won position. Pfc. Magrath fearlessly volunteered again to brave the shelling in order to collect a report of casualties.

Completely disregarding the great danger involved, he remained in his exposed position, and, with his M1 rifle, killed the enemy one by one until he was wounded four times. Taken to a covered position, he insisted on returning to a forward position to stand guard during the night. On the following morning the enemy launched a concerted attack and advanced to within a few yards of the position, throwing hand grenades as they approached. One of these landed within a few feet of Pfc. Mann. Unable to raise his arms, which were bandaged to his body, he yelled \"Grenade\" and threw his body over the grenade, and as it exploded, died.

First Lieutenant Monteith landed with the initial assault waves on the coast of France under heavy enemy fire. Without regard to his own personal safety he continually moved up and down the beach reorganizing men for further assault. He then led the assault over a narrow protective ledge and across the flat, exposed terrain to the comparative safety of a cliff. Retracing his steps across the field to the beach, he moved over to where two tanks were buttoned up and blind under violent enemy artillery and machinegun fire. Completely exposed to the intense fire, First Lieutenant Monteith led the tanks on foot through a minefield and into firing positions. Under his direction several enemy positions were destroyed. He then rejoined his company and under his leadership his men captured an advantageous position on the hill. Supervising the defense of his newly won position against repeated vicious counterattacks, he continued to ignore his own personal safety, repeatedly crossing the 200 or 300 yards of open terrain under heavy fire to strengthen links in his defensive chain. When the enemy succeeded in completely surrounding First Lieutenant Monteith and his unit and while leading the fight out of the situation, First Lieutenant Monteith was killed by enemy fire. The courage, gallantry, and intrepid leadership displayed by First Lieutenant Monteith is worthy of emulation.\n|-\n| [[File:JackMontgomery.jpg|75px]]\n| {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Jack C.|Montgomery}}}}\n| {{Sort|O-02|[[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]}}\n| near, Padiglione, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|February|22|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Harold H.|Moon, Jr.}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|E-01|[[Private (rank)#United States|Private]]}}\n| Pawig, Leyte, Philippines\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|October|21|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| [[File:John C.

Maneuvering on the surface into the midst of a heavily escorted convoy, O'Kane landed hits on three tankers, swung his ship to fire at a freighter and shot out of the path of an onrushing transport. Boxed in by blazing tankers, a freighter, transport, and several destroyers, he blasted two of the targets and cleared the area. Twenty-four hours later, he made contact with another heavily escorted convoy. In the midst of relentless enemy fire, he sent two torpedoes into the first and second transports and an adjacent tanker. He charged the enemy at high speed, exploding the tanker in a burst of flame, smashing the transport dead in the water, and blasting the destroyer. He fired his last two torpedoes at the remnants of the convoy before the second torpedo malfunctioned, performing a circular run and hitting the Tang in the stern. O'Kane along with eight officers survived the sinking. He remained a Japanese prisoner-of-war until 1945.\n|-\n| [[File:James K Okubo.jpg|75px|alt=Head and shoulders of a young man with a bright smile and neatly combed hair wearing what appears to be a graduation gown over a shirt and tie.]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|James K.|Okubo}}}}{{KIA}}\n| rowspan=\"7\" | [[United States Army|Army]]\n| {{Sort|E-03|[[Technician Fifth Grade]]}}\n| Foret Domaniale de Champ, near Biffontaine, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|October|28|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|October|29|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;and {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|November|4|format=mdy}}}}\n| One of 22 Asian American soldiers who received their medals in 2000, after a study revealed discrimination that caused them to be overlooked at the time.\n|-\n| [[File:Yukio Okutsu.jpg|75px|alt=Head and shoulders of an elderly man wearing a white button shirt with an emblem on the left breast bearing the text \"442\" and \"GO FOR BROKE\".]]\n| {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Yukio|Okutsu}}}}\n| {{Sort|E-07|[[Technical Sergeant]]}}\n| on Mount Belvedere, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1945|April|7|format=mdy}}}}\n| One of 22 Asian American soldiers who received their medals in 2000, after a study revealed discrimination that caused them to be overlooked at the time.\n|-\n| [[File:ArloOlson.jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Arlo L.|Olson}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|O-03|[[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]}}\n| crossing of the Volturno River, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1943|October|13|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Truman O.|Olson}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|E-05|[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]]}}\n| near Cisterna di Littoria, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|January|30|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|January|31|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| [[File:Frank H Ono.jpg|75px|alt=Head and shoulders of a young man with a garrison cap tilted over his right ear wearing a scarf tied around his neck and a military jacket with three ribbon bars and a pin on the left breast.

Comdr.

Volunteering for a perilous mission unsuccessfully attempted by the pilot's squadron mates and a PBY plane, Lt. Comdr. (then Lieutenant) Preston led PT-489 and PT-363 through 60 miles of restricted, heavily mined waters. Twice turned back while running the gauntlet of fire from powerful coastal defense guns guarding the 11-mile strait at the entrance to the bay, he was again turned back by furious fire in the immediate area of the downed airman. Aided by an aircraft smoke screen, he finally succeeded in reaching his objective and, under vicious fire delivered at 150-yard range, took the pilot aboard and cleared the area, sinking a small hostile cargo vessel with 40-mm. fire during retirement. Increasingly vulnerable when covering aircraft were forced to leave because of insufficient fuel, Lt. Comdr. Preston raced PT boats 489 and 363 at high speed for 20 minutes through shell-splashed water and across minefields to safety. Under continuous fire for 2 l/2 hours, Lt. Comdr. Preston successfully achieved a mission considered suicidal in its tremendous hazards, and brought his boats through without personnel casualties and with but superficial damage from shrapnel. His exceptional daring and great personal valor enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Ernest W.|Prussman}}}}{{KIA}}\n| [[United States Army|Army]]\n| {{Sort|E-02|[[Private First Class#United States|Private First Class]]}}\n| near Les Coates, Brittany, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|September|8|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Donald D.|Pucket}}}}{{KIA}}\n| [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Forces]]\n| {{Sort|O-02|[[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]}}\n| Ploie\u0219ti Raid, Romania\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|July|9|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|}\n\n== R ==\n{{legend2|#e3d9ff|This along with the {{KIA}}, indicates that the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Image !!

Reese Jr was engaged in the attack on the Paco Railroad Station, which was strongly defended by 300 determined enemy soldiers with machineguns and rifles, supported by several pillboxes, 3 20mm. guns, 1 37-mm. gun and heavy mortars.\nHis platoon was halted 100 yards from the station by intense enemy fire. On his own initiative he left the platoon, accompanied by a comrade, and continued forward to a house 60 yards from the objective.\nAlthough under constant enemy observation, the 2 men remained in this position for an hour, firing at targets of opportunity, killing more than 35 Japanese and wounding many more. Moving closer to the station and discovering a group of Japanese replacements attempting to reach pillboxes, they opened heavy fire, killed more than 40 and stopped all subsequent attempts to man the emplacements. Enemy fire became more intense as they advanced to within 20 yards of the station. From that point Pfc. Reese provided effective covering fire and courageously drew enemy fire to himself while his companion killed 7 Japanese and destroyed a 20-mm. gun and heavy machinegun with handgrenades. With their ammunition running low, the 2 men started to return to the American lines, alternately providing covering fire for each other as they withdrew. During this movement, Pfc. Reese was killed by enemy fire as he reloaded his rifle.

Fully aware of the limited chance of surviving an urgent mission, voluntarily undertaken to prevent a surprise Japanese attack against our forces, Lieutenant Commander Van Voorhis took off in total darkness on a perilous 700-mile flight without escort or support. Successful in reaching his objective despite treacherous and varying winds, low visibility and difficult terrain, he fought a lone but relentless battle under fierce antiaircraft fire and overwhelming aerial opposition. Forced lower and lower by pursuing planes, he coolly persisted in his mission of destruction. Abandoning all chance of a safe return he executed 6 bold ground-level attacks to demolish the enemy's vital radio station, installations, antiaircraft guns and crews with bombs and machine gun fire, and to destroy 1 fighter plane in the air and 3 on the water. Caught in his own bomb blast, Commander Van Voorhis crashed into the lagoon off the beach, sacrificing himself in a single-handed fight against almost insuperable odds, to make a distinctive contribution to our continued offensive in driving the Japanese from the Solomons and, by his superb daring, courage and resoluteness of purpose, enhanced the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

The first began in [[Asia]] in 1937 as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; the other began in [[Europe]] in 1939 with the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>Official military histories in Commonwealth nations refer to the conflict as the Second World War, while the United States' official histories refer to the conflict as World War II. English translations of the official histories of other nations tend to resolve into English as Second World War also, for example ''zweite weltkrieg'' in German. See [[C.P. Stacey]] ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', for example. \"Official\" usage of these terms is giving way to popular usage and the two terms are becoming interchangeable even in formal military history.</ref> This global conflict split the [[Participants in World War II|majority of the world's nations]] into two opposing military alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers]].\n\nThe United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Honolulu]] that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time.\n\nFor actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor.<ref>This number includes seven late awards presented by President Obama on March 18, 2014 and the award to Garlin Murl Conner by President Trump on June 26, 2018.</ref> Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]] during the Clinton administration. Additionally, [[Douglas Albert Munro]] was the only serviceman from the [[United States Coast Guard]] in [[Military history of the United States|United States military history]] to receive the Medal for his actions during the war.\n\nThe earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so \"while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force\" rather than \"enemy\" since the United States was [[neutral country|neutral]] during the events of December 7, 1941. The last action to earn a contemporaneous Medal of Honor prior to the August 15, 1945, [[Victory over Japan Day|end of hostilities]] in World War II, were those of [[Melvin Mayfield]], on July 29, 1945 \u2013 though several honorees may have been cited for their Medal after Mayfield's recognition on May 31, 1946. Additionally, seven [[African Americans]] and twenty-two [[Asian American]] veterans who had received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] during the war were awarded the Medal of Honor in 1997 and 2000 \u2013 most of them posthumously \u2013 after two studies determined that [[Medal of Honor#Past discrimination|racial discrimination]] had caused them to be overlooked at the time.<ref>Niiya, Brian. \"[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Congressional%20Medal%20of%20Honor%20recipients/ Congressional Medal of Honor recipients],\" ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

Barfoot (then Tech. Sgt.) moved off alone upon the enemy left flank. He crawled to the proximity of 1 machinegun nest and made a direct hit on it with a hand grenade, killing 2 and wounding 3 Germans. He continued along the German defense line to another machinegun emplacement, and with his tommygun killed 2 and captured 3 soldiers. Members of another enemy machinegun crew then abandoned their position and gave themselves up to Sgt. Barfoot. Leaving the prisoners for his support squad to pick up, he proceeded to mop up positions in the immediate area, capturing more prisoners and bringing his total count to 17. Later that day, after he had reorganized his men and consolidated the newly captured ground, the enemy launched a fierce armored counterattack directly at his platoon positions. Securing a bazooka, Sgt. Barfoot took up an exposed position directly in front of 3 advancing Mark VI tanks. From a distance of 75 yards his first shot destroyed the track of the leading tank, effectively disabling it, while the other 2 changed direction toward the flank. As the crew of the disabled tank dismounted, Sgt. Barfoot killed 3 of them with his tommygun. He continued onward into enemy terrain and destroyed a recently abandoned German fieldpiece with a demolition charge placed in the breech. While returning to his platoon position, Sgt. Barfoot, though greatly fatigued by his Herculean efforts, assisted 2 of his seriously wounded men 1,700 yards to a position of safety. Sgt. Barfoot's extraordinary heroism, demonstration of magnificent valor, and aggressive determination in the face of pointblank fire are a perpetual inspiration to his fellow soldiers.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Barfoot - Native Americans in the United States Army |url=https://www.army.mil/americanindians/barfoot.html |website=www.army.mil |accessdate=9 April 2020 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:44-11-17-MoH-CarltonBarrett.jpg|75px|alt=photo of Barrett holding MoH box.]]\n| {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Carlton W.|Barrett}}}}\n| {{Sort|E-01|[[Private (rank)#United States|Private]]}}\n| near St. Laurent-sur-Mer, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|June|6|format=mdy}}}}\n| Joined the United States Army in Albany, New York, he was a member of, 18th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division.

Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns that fought for the next 48 hours until only Basilone and two other men were still able to continue fighting. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He repaired another machine-gun and personally manned it, holding the defensive line until replacements arrived. With the continuous fighting, ammunition became critically low and supply lines were cut off. Basilone fought through hostile lines and returned with urgently needed ammunition for his gunners.

He elected to make a second low-level run over a thoroughly alerted convoy and scored two direct hits on a large tanker. His co-pilot was wounded, and his aircraft had two engines knocked out, a third damaged, the hydraulic system damaged, and a fuel tank punctured. He managed to gain enough altitude to reach land, where he ordered the crew to bail out. Eight did, but the bombardier's parachute was too badly damaged to use. Instead of bailing out, Carswell stayed with the bombardier and the wounded co-pilot, and attempted a crash landing.

He later, on separate occasions, rescued a man 200 yards on the same escarpment, treated 4 men within 8 yards of an enemy's cave, treated and administered plasma to an injured artillery officer while continually under fire, and 25 feet from an enemy position, treated and carried another soldier 100 feet to safety.  Finally, while he was giving aid to injured soldiers under fire, he was himself injured in the legs by a grenade.  He tended his own wounds while he waited for his fellow soldiers to bring a litter.  When they arrived, he saw another soldier injured worse and directed the bearers to rescue him first.  While waiting for their return, he was shot in the arm.  He strapped a gun stock to his arm as splint and crawled the 300 yards of rough terrain to the aid station.

About eighty Germans advanced under the cover of an artillery barrage in the darkness and were within about 200 yards of the platoon's positions when they were discovered by Johnston who was at his gun. He manned his machine gun and the attack was halted. All during the day, without relief, he remained with his weapon and fired at every target that presented itself. One German worked up the draw so close to the position that the machine gun could not be brought to bear upon him. Johnston drew his pistol and killed him. As the day wore on, it became evident that if the Company was to escape it would have to begin its movement. Not everyone could get out. Johnson volunteered to stay. Afterwards an artillery shell made what almost amounted to a direct hit on Johnston's position and shell fragments penetrated into the left portion of his chest. An examination indicated that he was dying. The rapid advance of large numbers of the Germans prevented any evacuation. A few minutes later one of the last men to withdraw saw Johnston trying to crawl up to his machine gun. At Johnston's request he was helped to his gun and left believing that he was dying. A few minutes later the Company heard the machine gun in action. It continued to fire for about 10 minutes. Afterwards the gun went silent. The Germans passed him as he lay in his position, and, believing him to be dead, stole his shoes. The next day, he painfully worked his way through the German lines to the 180th Regiment, after having been reported by the Company as killed in action. Despite his weakened condition, he gave accurate and vital information about the German positions on the base of which effective firing that was compiled.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:Jones HC NH92307.jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Herbert C.|Jones}}}}{{KIA}}\n| [[United States Navy|Navy]]\n| {{Sort|O-01|[[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]}}\n| Pearl Harbor, Hawaii\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1941|December|7|format=mdy}}}}\n|Organized and led a party to supply ammunition to the antiaircraft battery of [[USS California (BB-44)|USS ''California'']] after the mechanical hoists were put out of action when he was fatally wounded by a bomb explosion.

Carrying this enemy weapon across an open field through heavy fire, he neutralized 2 more machinegun nests; he then circled behind 4 other Germans, killing them with a burst as they were firing on his company. Spotting another dangerous enemy position to this right, he knelt with the machinegun in his arms and exchanged fire with the Germans until he had killed 2 and wounded 3.

Completely disregarding the great danger involved, he remained in his exposed position, and, with his M1 rifle, killed the enemy one by one until he was wounded four times. Taken to a covered position, he insisted on returning to a forward position to stand guard during the night. On the following morning the enemy launched a concerted attack and advanced to within a few yards of the position, throwing hand grenades as they approached. One of these landed within a few feet of Pfc. Mann. Unable to raise his arms, which were bandaged to his body, he yelled \"Grenade\" and threw his body over the grenade, and as it exploded, died.

First Lieutenant Monteith landed with the initial assault waves on the coast of France under heavy enemy fire. Without regard to his own personal safety he continually moved up and down the beach reorganizing men for further assault. He then led the assault over a narrow protective ledge and across the flat, exposed terrain to the comparative safety of a cliff. Retracing his steps across the field to the beach, he moved over to where two tanks were buttoned up and blind under violent enemy artillery and machinegun fire. Completely exposed to the intense fire, First Lieutenant Monteith led the tanks on foot through a minefield and into firing positions. Under his direction several enemy positions were destroyed. He then rejoined his company and under his leadership his men captured an advantageous position on the hill. Supervising the defense of his newly won position against repeated vicious counterattacks, he continued to ignore his own personal safety, repeatedly crossing the 200 or 300 yards of open terrain under heavy fire to strengthen links in his defensive chain. When the enemy succeeded in completely surrounding First Lieutenant Monteith and his unit and while leading the fight out of the situation, First Lieutenant Monteith was killed by enemy fire. The courage, gallantry, and intrepid leadership displayed by First Lieutenant Monteith is worthy of emulation.\n|-\n| [[File:JackMontgomery.jpg|75px]]\n| {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Jack C.|Montgomery}}}}\n| {{Sort|O-02|[[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]}}\n| near, Padiglione, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|February|22|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Harold H.|Moon, Jr.}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|E-01|[[Private (rank)#United States|Private]]}}\n| Pawig, Leyte, Philippines\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|October|21|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| [[File:John C.

Boxed in by blazing tankers, a freighter, transport, and several destroyers, he blasted two of the targets and cleared the area. Twenty-four hours later, he made contact with another heavily escorted convoy. In the midst of relentless enemy fire, he sent two torpedoes into the first and second transports and an adjacent tanker. He charged the enemy at high speed, exploding the tanker in a burst of flame, smashing the transport dead in the water, and blasting the destroyer. He fired his last two torpedoes at the remnants of the convoy before the second torpedo malfunctioned, performing a circular run and hitting the Tang in the stern. O'Kane along with eight officers survived the sinking. He remained a Japanese prisoner-of-war until 1945.\n|-\n| [[File:James K Okubo.jpg|75px|alt=Head and shoulders of a young man with a bright smile and neatly combed hair wearing what appears to be a graduation gown over a shirt and tie.]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|James K.|Okubo}}}}{{KIA}}\n| rowspan=\"7\" | [[United States Army|Army]]\n| {{Sort|E-03|[[Technician Fifth Grade]]}}\n| Foret Domaniale de Champ, near Biffontaine, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|October|28|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|October|29|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;and {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|November|4|format=mdy}}}}\n| One of 22 Asian American soldiers who received their medals in 2000, after a study revealed discrimination that caused them to be overlooked at the time.\n|-\n| [[File:Yukio Okutsu.jpg|75px|alt=Head and shoulders of an elderly man wearing a white button shirt with an emblem on the left breast bearing the text \"442\" and \"GO FOR BROKE\".]]\n| {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Yukio|Okutsu}}}}\n| {{Sort|E-07|[[Technical Sergeant]]}}\n| on Mount Belvedere, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1945|April|7|format=mdy}}}}\n| One of 22 Asian American soldiers who received their medals in 2000, after a study revealed discrimination that caused them to be overlooked at the time.\n|-\n| [[File:ArloOlson.jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Arlo L.|Olson}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|O-03|[[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]}}\n| crossing of the Volturno River, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1943|October|13|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Truman O.|Olson}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|E-05|[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]]}}\n| near Cisterna di Littoria, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|January|30|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|January|31|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| [[File:Frank H Ono.jpg|75px|alt=Head and shoulders of a young man with a garrison cap tilted over his right ear wearing a scarf tied around his neck and a military jacket with three ribbon bars and a pin on the left breast.

Comdr.

Volunteering for a perilous mission unsuccessfully attempted by the pilot's squadron mates and a PBY plane, Lt. Comdr. (then Lieutenant) Preston led PT-489 and PT-363 through 60 miles of restricted, heavily mined waters. Twice turned back while running the gauntlet of fire from powerful coastal defense guns guarding the 11-mile strait at the entrance to the bay, he was again turned back by furious fire in the immediate area of the downed airman. Aided by an aircraft smoke screen, he finally succeeded in reaching his objective and, under vicious fire delivered at 150-yard range, took the pilot aboard and cleared the area, sinking a small hostile cargo vessel with 40-mm. fire during retirement. Increasingly vulnerable when covering aircraft were forced to leave because of insufficient fuel, Lt. Comdr. Preston raced PT boats 489 and 363 at high speed for 20 minutes through shell-splashed water and across minefields to safety. Under continuous fire for 2 l/2 hours, Lt. Comdr. Preston successfully achieved a mission considered suicidal in its tremendous hazards, and brought his boats through without personnel casualties and with but superficial damage from shrapnel. His exceptional daring and great personal valor enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Ernest W.|Prussman}}}}{{KIA}}\n| [[United States Army|Army]]\n| {{Sort|E-02|[[Private First Class#United States|Private First Class]]}}\n| near Les Coates, Brittany, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|September|8|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Donald D.|Pucket}}}}{{KIA}}\n| [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Forces]]\n| {{Sort|O-02|[[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]]}}\n| Ploie\u0219ti Raid, Romania\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|July|9|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|}\n\n== R ==\n{{legend2|#e3d9ff|This along with the {{KIA}}, indicates that the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Image !!

On his own initiative he left the platoon, accompanied by a comrade, and continued forward to a house 60 yards from the objective.\nAlthough under constant enemy observation, the 2 men remained in this position for an hour, firing at targets of opportunity, killing more than 35 Japanese and wounding many more. Moving closer to the station and discovering a group of Japanese replacements attempting to reach pillboxes, they opened heavy fire, killed more than 40 and stopped all subsequent attempts to man the emplacements. Enemy fire became more intense as they advanced to within 20 yards of the station. From that point Pfc. Reese provided effective covering fire and courageously drew enemy fire to himself while his companion killed 7 Japanese and destroyed a 20-mm. gun and heavy machinegun with handgrenades. With their ammunition running low, the 2 men started to return to the American lines, alternately providing covering fire for each other as they withdrew. During this movement, Pfc. Reese was killed by enemy fire as he reloaded his rifle. The intrepid team, in 2\u00bd hours of fierce fighting, killed more than 82 Japanese, completely disorganized their defense and paved the way for subsequent complete defeat of the enemy at this strong point.<ref>{{cite web |title=Native American Medal of Honor Recipients - US Army Center of Military History |url=https://history.army.mil/html/topics/natam/natam-moh.html |website=history.army.mil |accessdate=9 April 2020}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[File:Thomas J Reeves (MOH).jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Thomas J.|Reeves}}}}{{KIA}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[United States Navy|Navy]]\n| {{Sort|E-07|[[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief]] [[Radioman]]}}\n| {{USS|California|BB-44|6}}, Pearl Harbor\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1941|December|7|format=mdy}}}}\n|After the mechanized ammunition hoists were put out of action in [[USS California (BB-44)|USS ''California'']], in a burning passageway, assisted in ammunition supply by hand to the antiaircraft guns until he was killed by smoke and fire.\n|-\n| [[File:Milton E Ricketts.jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Milton E.|Ricketts|Milton Ernest Ricketts}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|O-03|[[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]]}}\n| USS ''Yorktown'', Battle of the Coral Sea\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1942|May|8|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| {{center|\u2014}}\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Paul F.|Riordan}}}}{{KIA}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[United States Army|Army]]\n| {{Sort|O-01|[[Second lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]]}}\n| near Cassino, [[Italy]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|February|3|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|February|8|format=mdy}}}}\n|\n|-\n| [[File:SSgtRubenRivers.jpg|75px]]\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | {{nowrap|{{Sortname|Ruben|Rivers}}}}{{KIA}}\n| {{Sort|E-06|[[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]]}}\n| toward Guebling, [[France]]\n| {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|November|15|format=mdy}}}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{nowrap|{{dts|1944|November|19|format=mdy}}}}\n| One of seven African American soldiers who received their medals belatedly, after a 1993 study revealed [[Medal of Honor#Past discrimination|discrimination]] that caused them to be overlooked at the time.

Fully aware of the limited chance of surviving an urgent mission, voluntarily undertaken to prevent a surprise Japanese attack against our forces, Lieutenant Commander Van Voorhis took off in total darkness on a perilous 700-mile flight without escort or support. Successful in reaching his objective despite treacherous and varying winds, low visibility and difficult terrain, he fought a lone but relentless battle under fierce antiaircraft fire and overwhelming aerial opposition. Forced lower and lower by pursuing planes, he coolly persisted in his mission of destruction. Abandoning all chance of a safe return he executed 6 bold ground-level attacks to demolish the enemy's vital radio station, installations, antiaircraft guns and crews with bombs and machine gun fire, and to destroy 1 fighter plane in the air and 3 on the water. Caught in his own bomb blast, Commander Van Voorhis crashed into the lagoon off the beach, sacrificing himself in a single-handed fight against almost insuperable odds, to make a distinctive contribution to our continued offensive in driving the Japanese from the Solomons and, by his superb daring, courage and resoluteness of purpose, enhanced the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.
