Meanwhile, Cementos Portland Monterrey began operations in 1920, and in 1931, the two companies merged, becoming Cementos Mexicanos, now CEMEX. In the 1960s, CEMEX grew significantly when it acquired several more plants throughout Mexico. In 1976, the company went public on the Mexican stock exchange, and that same year, became the largest cement producer in Mexico with the purchase of three plants from Cementos Guadalajara. In 1982, the company made significant progress in overseas markets, doubling its exports. Further acquisitions of Mexican cement companies were made in 1987 and 1989, making CEMEX one of the ten largest cement companies in the world.\n\nIn 2004, CEMEX received the [[Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award]] for their creative and efficient use of information technology.<ref>https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/Pages/business-transformation-awards.aspx</ref>\n\n===Internationalization, 1990\u20132006===\nIn 1992, CEMEX began its push into the international landscape with the purchase of Spain's two largest cement companies, Valenciana de Cementos (Valcem, currently head of CEMEX Spain) and Cementos SANSON. [[Venezuela]]'s largest cement company, VENCEMOS, was acquired by CEMEX in 1994, and plants were purchased the same year in the United States and in [[Panama]]. In 1995 CEMEX acquired a cement company in the [[Dominican Republic]], and with the purchase of a majority stake in a Colombian cement company in 1996, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In 1997\u20131999, the company expanded its scope to include Asia and Africa, making major purchases in the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]], as well as [[Costa Rica]]. The acquisition of U.S. based [[Southdown (corporation)|Southdown]] made CEMEX the largest cement company in North America, and further international purchases were made in the following two years\u2014a [[Thailand|Thai]] company in 2001, and in 2002, a [[Ponce Cement, Inc.|Puerto Rican]] company.<ref>{{Cite news |issn=0458-3035 |agency=Reuters |title=Mexico's Cemex to Buy Southdown of Houston |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2016-03-28 |date=2000-09-30 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/30/business/fi-29180}}</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 2005, CEMEX completed its $5.8 billion acquisition of the London-based [[RMC Group]], which made CEMEX the worldwide leader in ready-mix concrete production and increased its exposure to European markets. With the acquisition, the company expected its annual cement production to increase to 97 million tons. Also they had hoped to see its annual sales grow to $15 billion, just shy of the market leader, [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] {{nyse|LR}}, which had sales of $17 billion. As none of these targets was met, CEMEX started looking for another suitor in its [[M&A]] push.\n\nOn October 27, 2006, CEMEX announced a US$12.8 billion offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of [[Rinker Group]], Limited.  Seven months later, on April 10, 2007, the Rinker board of directors approved an upgraded offer of [[USD]] 14.2 billion, and on June 7, 2007, CEMEX secured the commitment from the holders of more than 50% of the shares to complete the acquisition.\n\n===Recent history (2006\u2013)===\nIn November 2006, an American embassy cable released via [[WikiLeaks]] listed Cemex among \"Mexico's monopolists\", with a market share of 87.6%; its competitor [[Holcim Apasco]] was listed with a market share of 12.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2006/11/06MEXICO6413.html|title=cable 06MEXICO6413, WHO ARE MEXICO'S MONOPOLISTS?|publisher=WikiLeaks}} (see also [http://wikileaks.jornada.com.mx/notas/sectores-clave-con-alto-grado-de-concentracion-del-mercado] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402102403/http://wikileaks.jornada.com.mx/notas/sectores-clave-con-alto-grado-de-concentracion-del-mercado/ |date=2014-04-02 }})</ref>\n\nShortly after the apparent finalization of the Rinker deal on 2007, the United States Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against CEMEX, blocking the acquisition.<ref>Source: http://www.fromthedoj.com/2009/03/us-doj-blocks-cemex-acquisition-of-rinker/ {{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> After a lengthy process, CEMEX complied with regulators by divesting (selling) 40+ cement and concrete plants formerly part of itself or Rinker, essentially devaluing the initial deal.<ref>http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f243500/243560.htm</ref>\n\nIn April 2008, the President of [[Venezuela]], [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], announced the nationalization of \"the whole cement industry\" in that country, in response to the belief that the industry was exporting its products in order to receive prices above those it was allowed within the country.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/04/world/main3993227.shtml?source=RSSattr=World_3993227 Hugo Chavez Nationalizes Cement Industry], CBS News, April 4, 2008.</ref> In mid-2008 the Venezuelan government took over the Venezuelan operations of CEMEX, the largest Venezuelan producer with around a 50% market share; a deal on compensation was still to be reached in March 2009,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSTRE5243CX20090305 |title=FACTBOX: Venezuela's nationalizations under Hugo Chavez |date=March 5, 2009 |agency=Reuters}}</ref> despite agreements being reached in mid-2008 with the other two major cement producers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/business/worldbusiness/19cement.html |work=The New York Times |title=Venezuela Is Set to Take Control of Cemex Plants |date=August 19, 2008 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> In December 2011, an agreement was reached, with Cemex receiving $600m in compensation, and benefiting from the cancellation of $154m in debt.<ref>Cemex, [http://www.cemex.com/MediaCenter/PressReleases/PressRelease20111201.aspx CEMEX and Venezuela sign agreement on compensation for nationalization of CEMEX Venezuela] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122123105/http://www.cemex.com/MediaCenter/PressReleases/PressRelease20111201.aspx |date=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter having problems with the Mexican peso devaluation of 2008, including problems with derivatives,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0931861120081009 |agency=Reuters |title=UPDATE 2-Mexico's Cemex tumbles on peso, derivatives |date=October 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>http://www.fool.com/investing/international/2008/10/10/precarious-peso-pounds-cemex.aspx</ref> CEMEX had to rethink its international standings to decrease debt and avoid a default.

Also, it funds the [[Catedra Blanca]], and honors architecture courses in three universities: the [[ITESM]], in Monterrey, the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]], in Mexico City, and the Barcelona School of Architecture. Also, CEMEX has created the Centro CEMEX-Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, which is a research and development program for sustainable communities across Mexico thru the Premio CEMEX-TEC.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), through their Trust for the Americas, awarded the company The Corporate Citizen of the Americas Award 2007, for the social benefits of their program \"Patrimonio Hoy\", in Mexico, that according to [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza]], President of the OAS, has a positive effect in low-income families.  This initiative, conceived in 1998, aims to reduce the Mexican housing deficit, which leaves more than 20 million people with inadequate shelter. Patrimonio Hoy organizes low-income families into self-financing cells that facilitate and expedite the typical homebuilding process. CEMEX and its network provide the products needed but also the technical assistance, including an architect who helps design homes to optimize space and reduce waste. To date, more than 150,000 Mexican families have realized their dreams of home ownership <ref>[http://www.elnorte.com/negocios/articulo/750543/ Recibe Cemex reconocimiento], by ''[[El Norte (Monterrey)|El Norte]]'', in Spanish, requires subscription (original text: \"Cemex M\u00e9xico recibi\u00f3 el reconocimiento internacional por los beneficios sociales de su programa Patrimonio Hoy, durante la entrega de \"The Corporate Citizen of the Americas Award 2007\" que organiza The Trust for the Americas y la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos (OEA).

The fine was the highest ever given under the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control]] regulations, and was also the highest for an [[Environment Agency]] prosecution for six years.<ref>[[ENDS Report]] 381, October 2006, pp 4-5</ref> The fine was, however, judged excessive by the Court of Appeal and so reduced to \u00a350,000.<ref>[[ENDS Report]] 391, August 2007</ref> In April 2007, CEMEX announced that it had installed a \u00a36.5 million dust abatement system at the same works in Rugby, which had cut particulate emissions by 80%. Nevertheless, this could not prevent the legendary Deadpool from scaling the firm's Attenborough site and performing bizarre dances on top of the building. The site comes under the auspices of the EU Waste Incineration Directive as it burns waste tyres for fuel. There are concerns over the impact on both the environment and human health from this practice, although it is common practice in many cement works.<ref>[[ENDS Report]] 388, May 2007, p 29</ref>\n\nDuring tests conducted from June 10 to August 5, 2008, the Monterey Bay (California) Unified Air Pollution Control District reported high levels of [[chromium VI]], also known as hexavalent chromium, a cancer causing chemical agent, at an elementary school and fire department in [[Davenport, California]]. Chromium VI is the contaminant that inspired the movie, ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]''. The toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the Cemex Cement plant in Davenport, as the levels of Chromium VI measured eight times the air district's acceptable level at Pacific Elementary School and 10 times at the Davenport Fire Department.

Meanwhile, Cementos Portland Monterrey began operations in 1920, and in 1931, the two companies merged, becoming Cementos Mexicanos, now CEMEX. In the 1960s, CEMEX grew significantly when it acquired several more plants throughout Mexico. In 1976, the company went public on the Mexican stock exchange, and that same year, became the largest cement producer in Mexico with the purchase of three plants from Cementos Guadalajara. In 1982, the company made significant progress in overseas markets, doubling its exports. Further acquisitions of Mexican cement companies were made in 1987 and 1989, making CEMEX one of the ten largest cement companies in the world.\n\nIn 2004, CEMEX received the [[Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award]] for their creative and efficient use of information technology.<ref>https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/Pages/business-transformation-awards.aspx</ref>\n\n===Internationalization, 1990\u20132006===\nIn 1992, CEMEX began its push into the international landscape with the purchase of Spain's two largest cement companies, Valenciana de Cementos (Valcem, currently head of CEMEX Spain) and Cementos SANSON. [[Venezuela]]'s largest cement company, VENCEMOS, was acquired by CEMEX in 1994, and plants were purchased the same year in the United States and in [[Panama]]. In 1995 CEMEX acquired a cement company in the [[Dominican Republic]], and with the purchase of a majority stake in a Colombian cement company in 1996, CEMEX became the third largest cement company in the world. In 1997\u20131999, the company expanded its scope to include Asia and Africa, making major purchases in the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]], as well as [[Costa Rica]]. The acquisition of U.S. based [[Southdown (corporation)|Southdown]] made CEMEX the largest cement company in North America, and further international purchases were made in the following two years\u2014a [[Thailand|Thai]] company in 2001, and in 2002, a [[Ponce Cement, Inc.|Puerto Rican]] company.<ref>{{Cite news |issn=0458-3035 |agency=Reuters |title=Mexico's Cemex to Buy Southdown of Houston |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2016-03-28 |date=2000-09-30 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/30/business/fi-29180}}</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 2005, CEMEX completed its $5.8 billion acquisition of the London-based [[RMC Group]], which made CEMEX the worldwide leader in ready-mix concrete production and increased its exposure to European markets. With the acquisition, the company expected its annual cement production to increase to 97 million tons. Also they had hoped to see its annual sales grow to $15 billion, just shy of the market leader, [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] {{nyse|LR}}, which had sales of $17 billion. As none of these targets was met, CEMEX started looking for another suitor in its [[M&A]] push.\n\nOn October 27, 2006, CEMEX announced a US$12.8 billion offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of [[Rinker Group]], Limited.  Seven months later, on April 10, 2007, the Rinker board of directors approved an upgraded offer of [[USD]] 14.2 billion, and on June 7, 2007, CEMEX secured the commitment from the holders of more than 50% of the shares to complete the acquisition.\n\n===Recent history (2006\u2013)===\nIn November 2006, an American embassy cable released via [[WikiLeaks]] listed Cemex among \"Mexico's monopolists\", with a market share of 87.6%; its competitor [[Holcim Apasco]] was listed with a market share of 12.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2006/11/06MEXICO6413.html|title=cable 06MEXICO6413, WHO ARE MEXICO'S MONOPOLISTS?|publisher=WikiLeaks}} (see also [http://wikileaks.jornada.com.mx/notas/sectores-clave-con-alto-grado-de-concentracion-del-mercado] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140402102403/http://wikileaks.jornada.com.mx/notas/sectores-clave-con-alto-grado-de-concentracion-del-mercado/ |date=2014-04-02 }})</ref>\n\nShortly after the apparent finalization of the Rinker deal on 2007, the United States Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against CEMEX, blocking the acquisition.<ref>Source: http://www.fromthedoj.com/2009/03/us-doj-blocks-cemex-acquisition-of-rinker/ {{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> After a lengthy process, CEMEX complied with regulators by divesting (selling) 40+ cement and concrete plants formerly part of itself or Rinker, essentially devaluing the initial deal.<ref>http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f243500/243560.htm</ref>\n\nIn April 2008, the President of [[Venezuela]], [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], announced the nationalization of \"the whole cement industry\" in that country, in response to the belief that the industry was exporting its products in order to receive prices above those it was allowed within the country.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/04/world/main3993227.shtml?source=RSSattr=World_3993227 Hugo Chavez Nationalizes Cement Industry], CBS News, April 4, 2008.</ref> In mid-2008 the Venezuelan government took over the Venezuelan operations of CEMEX, the largest Venezuelan producer with around a 50% market share; a deal on compensation was still to be reached in March 2009,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSTRE5243CX20090305 |title=FACTBOX: Venezuela's nationalizations under Hugo Chavez |date=March 5, 2009 |agency=Reuters}}</ref> despite agreements being reached in mid-2008 with the other two major cement producers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/business/worldbusiness/19cement.html |work=The New York Times |title=Venezuela Is Set to Take Control of Cemex Plants |date=August 19, 2008 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref> In December 2011, an agreement was reached, with Cemex receiving $600m in compensation, and benefiting from the cancellation of $154m in debt.<ref>Cemex, [http://www.cemex.com/MediaCenter/PressReleases/PressRelease20111201.aspx CEMEX and Venezuela sign agreement on compensation for nationalization of CEMEX Venezuela] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122123105/http://www.cemex.com/MediaCenter/PressReleases/PressRelease20111201.aspx |date=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter having problems with the Mexican peso devaluation of 2008, including problems with derivatives,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0931861120081009 |agency=Reuters |title=UPDATE 2-Mexico's Cemex tumbles on peso, derivatives |date=October 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>http://www.fool.com/investing/international/2008/10/10/precarious-peso-pounds-cemex.aspx</ref> CEMEX had to rethink its international standings to decrease debt and avoid a default.

Chromium VI is the contaminant that inspired the movie, ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]''. The toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the Cemex Cement plant in Davenport, as the levels of Chromium VI measured eight times the air district's acceptable level at Pacific Elementary School and 10 times at the Davenport Fire Department. Both are located less than a half-mile from CEMEX.<ref>Source: http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_10630621 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207120130/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_10630621 |date=2008-12-07 }}</ref> Chromium VI may have been unwittingly produced at the CEMEX plant in Davenport for the last seven years.

Basketball WA's most prominent competitions are the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) and the Western Australian Basketball League (WABL). The SBL comprises both a men's and women's semi-professional competition, while the WABL consists of multiple under-age junior divisions.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Leonard Perpetual Shield.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The John Leonard Perpetual Shield]]\nThe Western Australian Basketball Federation (WABF) was founded in 1946 as the '''Western Australian Basketball Association'''. The original Western Australian Basketball Association was formed by a small group of basketball enthusiasts at the Perth YMCA on Murray Street on Wednesday, 3 April 1946. The sport had already been played across the state for 35 years, but there had been no official management or promotion of the sport. [[Johnny Leonard|John Leonard]], a highly respected Perth businessman, athlete and two-time winner of football's coveted [[Sandover Medal]], played a key role in orchestrating the first meeting on 3 April 1946. The initial aim was to form a body that would manage, control and promote the development of basketball in Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/history-of-basketball-wa/|title=HISTORY OF BASKETBALL WA|work=basketballwa.asn.au|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the local associations played in a winter competition at [[Claremont Showground]] for the John Leonard Perpetual Shield.<ref name=handbook89>{{cite book |year=1989 |title=McDonald's State Basketball League Handbook 1989 |publisher=Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.) |page=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 Commonwealth Games]], the WABF's headquarters switched to the newly-built [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. The A&nbsp;Grade competition continued until 1972, when it was renamed the District Competition, involving seven association teams, although this was soon increased to eight. This format continued to 1987, although the competition underwent several name changes as sponsors began to show their interest. 1987 was something of a watershed year for the WABF, as the entire structure of the game in [[Western Australia]] was being reconsidered.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nThe impetus for the rethink was the dire financial straits which the WABF found itself in the previous year. The [[Perth Wildcats]] had been a financial burden since joining the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) in 1982, and at the end of the 1986 season, the WABF was $400,000 in the red. A task force was established to sort out the mess, and the upshot was that Perth businessman Bob Williams, sponsor of the Wildcats in 1986, purchased a 60 percent interest in the team from the WABF for $200,000. The WABF's administration was also restructured, with Alan Marshall joining as chief executive with a brief to put the WABF on a firm financial footing.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nA census in 1987 showed that 61 percent of WABF members were from country areas, so it was decided to try to include several country teams in the state's premier basketball league. However, this could not be done until the WABF had traded out its difficulties. Fortunately, the Wildcats had a hugely successful season in 1987\u2014reaching the NBL Grand Final in their first trip to the finals\u2014attracting much television coverage, which saw basketball's popularity soar.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nAn immediate result of the sport's new popularity was the debut of [[McDonald's]] as a sponsor. The fast-food chain entered into a $150,000 three-year deal with the WABF, sponsoring the premier competition and funding an extensive junior programme.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nIn 1988, it was decided to form a '''State Basketball League''' for both men and women, and to develop it into an elite, statewide competition as soon as possible.

Basketball WA's most prominent competitions are the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) and the Western Australian Basketball League (WABL). The SBL comprises both a men's and women's semi-professional competition, while the WABL consists of multiple under-age junior divisions.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Leonard Perpetual Shield.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The John Leonard Perpetual Shield]]\nThe Western Australian Basketball Federation (WABF) was founded in 1946 as the '''Western Australian Basketball Association'''. The original Western Australian Basketball Association was formed by a small group of basketball enthusiasts at the Perth YMCA on Murray Street on Wednesday, 3 April 1946. The sport had already been played across the state for 35 years, but there had been no official management or promotion of the sport. [[Johnny Leonard|John Leonard]], a highly respected Perth businessman, athlete and two-time winner of football's coveted [[Sandover Medal]], played a key role in orchestrating the first meeting on 3 April 1946. The initial aim was to form a body that would manage, control and promote the development of basketball in Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://basketballwa.asn.au/history-of-basketball-wa/|title=HISTORY OF BASKETBALL WA|work=basketballwa.asn.au|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the local associations played in a winter competition at [[Claremont Showground]] for the John Leonard Perpetual Shield.<ref name=handbook89>{{cite book |year=1989 |title=McDonald's State Basketball League Handbook 1989 |publisher=Western Australian Basketball Federation (Inc.) |page=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 Commonwealth Games]], the WABF's headquarters switched to the newly-built [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. The A&nbsp;Grade competition continued until 1972, when it was renamed the District Competition, involving seven association teams, although this was soon increased to eight. This format continued to 1987, although the competition underwent several name changes as sponsors began to show their interest. 1987 was something of a watershed year for the WABF, as the entire structure of the game in [[Western Australia]] was being reconsidered.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nThe impetus for the rethink was the dire financial straits which the WABF found itself in the previous year. The [[Perth Wildcats]] had been a financial burden since joining the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) in 1982, and at the end of the 1986 season, the WABF was $400,000 in the red. A task force was established to sort out the mess, and the upshot was that Perth businessman Bob Williams, sponsor of the Wildcats in 1986, purchased a 60 percent interest in the team from the WABF for $200,000. The WABF's administration was also restructured, with Alan Marshall joining as chief executive with a brief to put the WABF on a firm financial footing.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nA census in 1987 showed that 61 percent of WABF members were from country areas, so it was decided to try to include several country teams in the state's premier basketball league. However, this could not be done until the WABF had traded out its difficulties. Fortunately, the Wildcats had a hugely successful season in 1987\u2014reaching the NBL Grand Final in their first trip to the finals\u2014attracting much television coverage, which saw basketball's popularity soar.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nAn immediate result of the sport's new popularity was the debut of [[McDonald's]] as a sponsor. The fast-food chain entered into a $150,000 three-year deal with the WABF, sponsoring the premier competition and funding an extensive junior programme.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nIn 1988, it was decided to form a '''State Basketball League''' for both men and women, and to develop it into an elite, statewide competition as soon as possible. This meant seeking out private owners and attracting corporate sponsorship, so as to not burden the association. As part of basketball's development, the [[Western Australian Institute of Sport]] men's team was included in the SBL under Warren Kuhn.<ref name=\"handbook89\" />\n\nSimon Leunig, who had been the WABF's development officer, was appointed general manager of the SBL, and set about organising an expanded league for 1989.

Although he was the first pope from a [[monasticism|monastic]] background, his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator. During his papacy, he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of Rome, and he challenged the theological views of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]] before the Emperor [[Tiberius II]]. Gregory regained papal authority in [[Catholic Church in Spain|Spain]] and [[Catholic Church in France|France]] and sent missionaries to [[Catholic Church in England|England]], including [[Augustine of Canterbury]] and [[Paulinus of York]]. The realignment of barbarian allegiance to Rome from their [[Arianism|Arian]] Christian alliances shaped medieval Europe. Gregory saw [[Franks]], [[Lombards]], and [[Visigoths]] align with Rome in religion. He also combated against the [[Donatism|Donatist]] heresy, popular particularly in North Africa at the time.<ref name=OCA />\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, he was known as \"the Father of Christian Worship\" because of his exceptional efforts in revising the Roman worship of his day.<ref>''Christian Life and Worship (Dissertations in European Economic History)'', 1948, 1979, Gerald Ellard (1894\u20131963), Arno Press, {{ISBN|0-405-10819-2}} {{ISBN|9780405108198}}, p. 125.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=PmFgHy8KwMEC&pg=PA125&dq=%22father+of+christian+worship%22&hl=en&ei=KrryTYLtB9ObtwepmJSNBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22father%20of%20christian%20worship%22&f=false]</ref> His contributions to the development of the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]], still in use in the [[Byzantine Rite]], were so significant that he is generally recognized as its ''de facto'' author.\n\nGregory is a [[Doctor of the Church]] and one of the [[Latin Fathers]].<ref>[[Elizabeth Livingstone|Livingstone, E.

Timothy 5.9 defines elderly women to be 60 and over, which would probably apply to all. Gregory appears not to consider himself an elder, limiting his birth to no earlier than 539, but 540 is the typical selection. Dudden (1905), page 3, notes 1\u20133.

They had another son whose name and fate are unknown.<ref>Dudden (1905), pages 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGregory was born into a period of upheaval in Italy. From 542 the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]] swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy. The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting. In some parts of the country, over 1/3 of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the Empire.<ref>Markus pg 4\u20135</ref> Politically, although the [[Western Roman Empire]] had long since vanished in favour of the Gothic kings of Italy, during the 540s [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] was gradually retaken from the [[Goths]] by [[Justinian I]], emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] ruling from [[Constantinople]]. As the fighting was mainly in the north, the young Gregory probably saw little of it. [[Totila]] [[Sack of Rome (546)|sacked and vacated Rome]] in 546, destroying most of its population, but in 549 he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets. It has been hypothesized that young Gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their Sicilian estates, to return in 549.<ref>Dudden (1905), pages 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|war]] was over in Rome by 552, and a subsequent invasion of the [[Franks]] was defeated in 554. After that, there was peace in Italy, and the appearance of restoration, except that the central government now resided in Constantinople.\n\nLike most young men of his position in Roman society, Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law; he excelled in all these fields.<ref name=Thornton /> [[Gregory of Tours]] reported that \"in grammar, dialectic and rhetoric ... he was second to none....\"<ref name=rich26>Richards (1980), page 26.</ref> He wrote correct Latin but did not read or write Greek. He knew Latin authors, natural science, history, mathematics and music and had such a \"fluency with imperial law\" that he may have trained in it \"as a preparation for a career in public life\".<ref name=rich26/> Indeed, he became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only thirty-three years old.<ref name=Thornton />\n\nThe monks of the Monastery of St. Andrew, established by Gregory at the ancestral home on the Caelian, had a portrait of him made after his death, which John the Deacon also saw in the 9th century. He reports the picture of a man who was \"rather bald\" and had a \"tawny\" beard like his father's and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mother's and father's. The hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled. His nose was \"thin and straight\" and \"slightly aquiline\". \"His forehead was high.\" He had thick, \"subdivided\" lips and a chin \"of a comely prominence\" and \"beautiful hands\".<ref>Richards (1980), page 44.</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, Gregory is often depicted as a man at the border, poised between the Roman and Germanic worlds, between East and West, and above all, perhaps, between the ancient and medieval epochs.<ref>Leyser pg 132</ref>\n\n==Monastic years==\n[[File:Jerome and Gregory.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jerome]] and Gregory]]\n\nOn his father's death, Gregory converted his family ''villa'' into a [[monastery]] dedicated to [[Andrew the Apostle]] (after his death it was rededicated as [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio]]). In his life of contemplation, Gregory concluded that \"in that silence of the heart, while we keep watch within through contemplation, we are as if asleep to all things that are without.\".<ref>Cavadini pg 155</ref>\n\nGregory took seriously the monk's vow of poverty.  Thus, when it came to light that a monk lying on his death bed had  stolen three gold pieces, Gregory, as a remedial punishment, forced the monk to die alone, then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a condemnation, \"Take your money with you to perdition\". Gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin, even in this life before death.<ref>Straw pg 47</ref> However, in time, after the monk's death, Gregory had 30 Masses offered for the man to [[Prayer for the dead|assist his soul]] before the [[final judgment]].\n\nEventually, [[Pope Pelagius II]] ordained Gregory a [[deacon]] and solicited his help in trying to heal the [[schism of the Three Chapters]] in [[northern Italy]]. However, this schism was not healed until well after Gregory was gone.<ref>Gregory the great and his world pg 3</ref>\n\nGregory had a deep respect for the monastic life. He viewed being a monk as the 'ardent quest for the vision of our Creator.'<ref>Markus- pg 69</ref> His three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity. However, after the [[Trasilla and Emiliana|two eldest]] died after seeing a vision of their ancestor [[Pope Felix III]], the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate. Gregory's response to this family scandal was \"many are called but few are chosen.\"<ref>Consul of God, Richards.

Papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether\".<ref name=\"e10\"/> Gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of [[John III Scholasticus]], who had occupied the Patriarchate of Constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople|Eutychius]] (who had been driven out by Justinian).<ref name=\"e10\"/> Gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the Byzantine elite of the city, where he became extremely popular with the city's upper class, \"especially aristocratic women\".<ref name=\"e10\"/> Ekonomou surmises that \"while Gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of Constantinople's aristocracy, this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of Rome before the emperor\".<ref name=\"e10\"/> Although the writings of John the Deacon claim that Gregory \"labored diligently for the relief of Italy\", there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of Pelagius II.<ref>Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nGregory's theological disputes with Patriarch Eutychius would leave a \"bitter taste for the theological speculation of the East\" with Gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy.<ref name=\"e11\">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 11.</ref> According to Western sources, Gregory's very public debate with Eutychius culminated in an exchange before [[Tiberius II]] where Gregory cited a biblical passage (\"''Palpate et videte, quia spiritus carnem et ossa non-habet, sicut me videtis habere'', or \"touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk024.htm Luke 24:39] \u2013 \"touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.\"</ref>) in support of the view that Christ was corporeal and palpable after his Resurrection; allegedly as a result of this exchange, Tiberius II ordered Eutychius's writings burned.<ref name=\"e11\"/> Ekonomou views this argument, though exaggerated in Western sources, as Gregory's \"one achievement of an otherwise fruitless ''apokrisiariat''\".<ref name=\"e12\">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 12.</ref> In reality, Gregory was forced to rely on Scripture because he could not read the untranslated Greek authoritative works.<ref name=\"e12\"/> \n\t \nGregory left Constantinople for Rome in 585, returning to his monastery on the [[Caelian Hill]].<ref name=\"e13\">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 13.</ref> Gregory was elected by [[acclamation]] to succeed Pelagius II in 590, when the latter died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] spreading through the city.<ref name=\"e13\"/> Gregory was approved by an Imperial ''[[iussio]]'' from Constantinople the following September (as was the norm during the [[Byzantine Papacy]]).<ref name=\"e13\"/>\n\n===Controversy with Eutychius===\nIn Constantinople, Gregory took issue with the aged [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]], who had recently published a treatise, now lost, on the [[Resurrection of the dead|General Resurrection]]. Eutychius maintained that the resurrected body \"will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines: Being a Continuation of 'The Dictionary of the Bible': VolumeII Eaba \u2013 Hermocrates|first=William|last=Smith|author2=Henry Wace|year=1880|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|pages=415}} The dictionary account is apparently based on [[Bede]], Book II, Chapter 1, who used the expression \"...impalpable, of finer texture than wind and air.\"</ref> Gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen Christ in {{bibleverse||Luke|24:39|KJV}}. As the dispute could not be settled, the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Tiberius II Constantine]], undertook to arbitrate. He decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be [[book burning|burned]]. Shortly after both Gregory and Eutychius became ill; Gregory recovered, but Eutychius died on 5 April 582, at age 70. On his deathbed Eutychius recanted impalpability and Gregory dropped the matter. Tiberius also died a few months after Eutychius.\n\n==Papacy==\n{{Infobox popestyles\n|image      = \n|dipstyle   = [[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle   = Your Holiness\n|relstyle   = Holy Father\n|deathstyle = Saint\n}}\nGregory was more inclined to remain retired into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation.<ref>Straw pg 25</ref> In texts of all genres, especially those produced in his first year as pope, Gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of\nprayer he had once enjoyed as a monk.<ref>Cavadini pg 39</ref>\nWhen he became pope in 590, among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of Peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks. At that time, for various reasons, the [[Holy See]] had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of [[Pope Gelasius I|Gelasius I]]. The episcopacy in [[Gaul]] was drawn from the great territorial families, and identified with them: the parochial horizon of Gregory's contemporary, [[Gregory of Tours]], may be considered typical; in [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain the bishops had little contact with Rome; in Italy the territories which had ''de facto'' fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent [[Lombards|Lombard]] dukes and the rivalry of the Byzantines in the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and in the south.\n\nPope Gregory had strong convictions on missions: \"Almighty God places good men in authority that He may impart through them the gifts of His mercy to their subjects. And this we find to be the case with the British over whom you have been appointed to rule, that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also.\"<ref>Dudden pg 124</ref> He is credited with re-energizing the Church's missionary work among the non-Christian peoples of northern Europe. He is most famous for sending a mission, often called the [[Gregorian mission]], under [[Augustine of Canterbury]], prior of Saint Andrew's, where he had perhaps succeeded Gregory, to evangelize the pagan [[Anglo-Saxons]] of England. It seems that the pope had never forgotten the English slaves whom he had once seen in the Roman Forum.<ref>Dudden pg 99</ref> The mission was successful, and it was from England that missionaries later set out for the Netherlands and Germany. The preaching of non-heretical Christian faith and the\nelimination of all deviations from it was a key element in Gregory's worldview, and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate.<ref name=\"Richards pg 228\">Richards pg 228</ref>\n\nAccording to Gilbert Huddleston, he was [[canonization|declared a saint]] immediately after his death by \"popular acclamation\".<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nIn his official documents, Gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term \"[[Servant of the Servants of God]]\" (''servus servorum Dei'') as a papal title, thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Servus servorum Dei}}</ref>\n\n===Alms===\n[[Alms]] in Christianity is defined by passages of the [[New Testament]] such as [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 19:21, which commands \"...go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor ... and come and follow me.\" A [[donation]] on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise, profit or non-profit.\n\nOn the one hand the alms of Gregory are to be distinguished from his donations, but on the other he himself probably saw no such distinction. The church had no interest in secular profit and as pope Gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel. Apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms.\n\nGregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at Rome. They were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the [[Lombards]]. The philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward. He received lavish donations from the wealthy families of Rome, who, following his own example, were eager, by doing so, to expiate their sins. He gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse. He wrote in letters:<ref>Dudden (1905) page 316.</ref>\n\n:\"I have frequently charged you ... to act as my representative ... to relieve the poor in their distress ....\"\n:\"... I hold the office of steward to the property of the poor ....\"\n\nThe church received donations of many different kinds of [[property]]: [[consumables]] such as food and clothing; investment property: real estate and works of art; and [[capital goods]], or [[revenue]]-generating property, such as the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[latifundia]], or agricultural estates, staffed and operated by [[slave]]s, donated by Gregory and his family. The church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor: associated with each parish was a ''diaconium'' or office of the [[deacon]]. He was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance.<ref>Later these deacons became cardinals and from the oratories attached to the buildings grew churches.</ref><ref>{{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofchri01smit/page/549 549] under diaconia|title=A dictionary of Christian antiquities: Comprising the History, Institutions, and Antiquities of the Christian Church, from the Time of the Apostles to the Age of Charlemagne|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofchri01smit|first=William|last=Smith|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|author2=Samuel Cheetham |authorlink2=Samuel Cheetham (priest) |publisher=J. Murray|year=1875}}</ref>\n\nThe state in which Gregory became pope in 590 was a ruined one. The Lombards held the better part of Italy. Their predations had brought the economy to a standstill. They camped nearly at the gates of Rome. The city was packed with refugees from all walks of life, who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life. The seat of government was far from Rome in [[Constantinople]], which appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail.\n[[File:Mass_of_St._Gregory,_c._1490,_attributed_to_Diego_de_la_Cruz,_oil_and_gold_on_panel_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', c. 1490, attributed to Diego de la Cruz, oil and gold on panel ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\nIn 590, Gregory could wait for Constantinople no longer. He organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief. In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting, which was not to be invented for centuries. The church already had basic accounting documents: every [[expense]] was recorded in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|journals]] called ''regesta'', \"lists\" of amounts, recipients and circumstances. Revenue was recorded in ''polyptici'', \"[[Bookkeeping|books]]\". Many of these polyptici were [[ledger]]s recording the operating expenses of the church and the [[asset]]s, the ''patrimonia''. A central papal administration, the ''notarii'', under a chief, the ''primicerius notariorum'', kept the ledgers and issued ''brevia patrimonii'', or lists of property for which each ''[[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]'' was responsible.<ref>{{cite book |pages=322|title=The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages: Volume X|first=Horace Kinder|last=Mann|author2=Johannes Hollnsteiner|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., Ltd.|location=London|year=1914}}</ref>\n\nGregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In a letter to a subordinate in [[Sicily]] he wrote: \"I asked you most of all to take care of the poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire that you give the woman, Pateria, forty [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ....\"<ref>Ambrosini & Willis (1996) pages 66\u201367.</ref> Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.<ref name=dud248>Dudden (1905) pages 248\u2013249.</ref>\n\nMoney, however, was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine. Even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas. The church now owned between {{convert|1300|and|1800|sqmi|km2}} of revenue-generating farmland divided into large sections called ''patrimonia.'' It produced goods of all kinds, which were sold, but Gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to Rome for distribution in the ''diaconia''. He gave orders to step up production, set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out. At the bottom was the ''rusticus'' who produced the goods. Some rustici were or owned slaves. He turned over part of his produce to a ''conductor'' from whom he leased the land. The latter reported to an ''actionarius'', the latter to a ''defensor'' and the latter to a ''rector''. Grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish and oil began to arrive at Rome in large quantities, where it was given away for nothing as alms.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Medieval Church, 590\u20131500|first=Margaret|last=Deanesly|publisher=Routledge|year=1969|location=London, New York|isbn=9780415039598|pages=22\u201324}}</ref>\n\nDistributions to qualified persons were monthly. However, a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.<ref name=dud248/>\n\nThese and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the rump state at Constantinople, which had only disrespect for Gregory,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the Lombards. The office of urban prefect went without candidates. From the time of Gregory the Great to the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] the papacy was most influential presence in Italy.\n\n==Works==\n===Liturgical reforms===\nJohn the Deacon wrote that Pope Gregory I made a general revision of the liturgy of the [[Pre-Tridentine Mass]], \"removing many things, changing a few, adding some\". In letters, Gregory remarks that he moved the ''[[Pater Noster]]'' (Our Father) to immediately after the [[Roman Canon]] and immediately before the [[Fraction (religion)|Fraction]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT487&dq=Pope+Gregory+I+%2B+Liturgical+reforms&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIlcuAnaPfAhWqT98KHYtxCSw4ChDoAQgzMAI#v=onepage&q=Pope%20Gregory%20I%20%2B%20Liturgical%20reforms&f=false Eden, Bradford L. \"Gregory I, Pope\", ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'', (Christopher Kleinhenz, ed.), Routledge, 2004]{{ISBN|9781135948801}}</ref> This position is still maintained today in the Roman Liturgy. The pre-Gregorian position is evident in the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Gregory added material to the ''[[Roman Canon#Hanc Igitur|Hanc Igitur]]'' of the Roman Canon and established the nine ''[[Kyrie]]s'' (a vestigial remnant of the [[litany]] which was originally at that place) at the beginning of [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. He also reduced the role of deacons in the Roman Liturgy.\n\n[[Sacramentary|Sacramentaries]] directly influenced by Gregorian reforms are referred to as ''Sacrementaria Gregoriana''. Roman and other [[Latin liturgical rites|Western liturgies]] since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season; these variations are visible in the [[collect]]s and [[preface]]s as well as in the Roman Canon itself.\n\n====Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts====\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], Gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]], a fully separate form of the [[Divine Liturgy]] in the [[Byzantine Rite]] adapted to the needs of the season of [[Great Lent]]. Its [[Roman Rite]] equivalent is the [[Mass of the Presanctified]] used only on [[Good Friday]]. The [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts continues to be used in the [[Malankara Rite]], a variant of the [[West Syrian Rite]] historically practiced in the [[Malankara Church]] of [[India]], and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].<ref>Chupungco, Anscar J.

Although he was the first pope from a [[monasticism|monastic]] background, his prior political experiences may have helped him to be a talented administrator. During his papacy, he greatly surpassed with his administration the emperors in improving the welfare of the people of Rome, and he challenged the theological views of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]] before the Emperor [[Tiberius II]]. Gregory regained papal authority in [[Catholic Church in Spain|Spain]] and [[Catholic Church in France|France]] and sent missionaries to [[Catholic Church in England|England]], Including [[Augustine of Canterbury]] and [[Paulinus of York]]. The realignment of barbarian allegiance to Rome from their [[Arianism|Arian]] Christian alliances shaped medieval Europe. Gregory saw [[Franks]], [[Lombards]], and [[Visigoths]] align with Rome in religion. He also combated against the [[Donatism|Donatist]] heresy, popular particularly in North Africa at the time.<ref name=OCA />\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, he was known as \"the Father of Christian Worship\" because of his exceptional efforts in revising the Roman worship of his day.<ref>''Christian Life and Worship (Dissertations in European Economic History)'', 1948, 1979, Gerald Ellard (1894\u20131963), Arno Press, {{ISBN|0-405-10819-2}} {{ISBN|9780405108198}}, p. 125.\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=PmFgHy8KwMEC&pg=PA125&dq=%22father+of+christian+worship%22&hl=en&ei=KrryTYLtB9ObtwepmJSNBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22father%20of%20christian%20worship%22&f=false]</ref> His contributions to the development of the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]], still in use in the [[Byzantine Rite]], were so significant that he is generally recognized as its ''de facto'' author.\n\nGregory is a [[Doctor of the Church]] and one of the [[Latin Fathers]].<ref>[[Elizabeth Livingstone|Livingstone, E.

In a letter of 598 (''Register'', Book 9, Letter 1) he rebukes Bishop Januarius of [[Cagliari]], Sardinia, excusing himself for not observing 1 Timothy 5.1, which cautions against rebuking elders. Timothy 5.9 defines elderly women to be 60 and over, which would probably apply to all. Gregory appears not to consider himself an elder, limiting his birth to no earlier than 539, but 540 is the typical selection. Dudden (1905), page 3, notes 1\u20133.

His mother and two paternal aunts are honored by Catholic and Orthodox churches as saints.<ref name=Thornton /><ref name=OCA /> Gregory's great-great-grandfather had been [[Pope Felix III]],<ref>Whether III or IV depends on whether [[Antipope Felix II]] is to be considered pope.</ref> the nominee of the Gothic king, [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]].<ref name=\"Dud4\">Dudden (1905), page 4.</ref> Gregory's election to the throne of St Peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period.<ref>Richards</ref>\n\nThe family owned and resided in a ''[[Roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' on the [[Caelian Hill]], fronting the same street (now the Via di San Gregorio) as the former palaces of the Roman emperors on the [[Palatine Hill]] opposite. The north of the street runs into the [[Colosseum]]; the south, the [[Circus Maximus]]. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned.<ref>Dudden (1905), pages 11\u201315.</ref> Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in [[Sicily]]<ref>Dudden (1905), pages 106\u2013107.</ref> and around Rome.<ref>Richards (1980), page 25.</ref> Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by [[Johannes Hymonides|John the Deacon]]. Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes. He wore a beard. [[Saint Silvia|Silvia]] was tall, had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful look. They had another son whose name and fate are unknown.<ref>Dudden (1905), pages 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nGregory was born into a period of upheaval in Italy. From 542 the so-called [[Plague of Justinian]] swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy. The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting. In some parts of the country, over 1/3 of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the Empire.<ref>Markus pg 4\u20135</ref> Politically, although the [[Western Roman Empire]] had long since vanished in favour of the Gothic kings of Italy, during the 540s [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] was gradually retaken from the [[Goths]] by [[Justinian I]], emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] ruling from [[Constantinople]]. As the fighting was mainly in the north, the young Gregory probably saw little of it. [[Totila]] [[Sack of Rome (546)|sacked and vacated Rome]] in 546, destroying most of its population, but in 549 he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets. It has been hypothesized that young Gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their Sicilian estates, to return in 549.<ref>Dudden (1905), pages 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|war]] was over in Rome by 552, and a subsequent invasion of the [[Franks]] was defeated in 554. After that, there was peace in Italy, and the appearance of restoration, except that the central government now resided in Constantinople.\n\nLike most young men of his position in Roman society, Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law; he excelled in all these fields.<ref name=Thornton /> [[Gregory of Tours]] reported that \"in grammar, dialectic and rhetoric ... he was second to none....\"<ref name=rich26>Richards (1980), page 26.</ref> He wrote correct Latin but did not read or write Greek. He knew Latin authors, natural science, history, mathematics and music and had such a \"fluency with imperial law\" that he may have trained in it \"as a preparation for a career in public life\".<ref name=rich26/> Indeed, he became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only thirty-three years old.<ref name=Thornton />\n\nThe monks of the Monastery of St. Andrew, established by Gregory at the ancestral home on the Caelian, had a portrait of him made after his death, which John the Deacon also saw in the 9th century. He reports the picture of a man who was \"rather bald\" and had a \"tawny\" beard like his father's and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mother's and father's. The hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled. His nose was \"thin and straight\" and \"slightly aquiline\". \"His forehead was high.\" He had thick, \"subdivided\" lips and a chin \"of a comely prominence\" and \"beautiful hands\".<ref>Richards (1980), page 44.</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, Gregory is often depicted as a man at the border, poised between the Roman and Germanic worlds, between East and West, and above all, perhaps, between the ancient and medieval epochs.<ref>Leyser pg 132</ref>\n\n==Monastic years==\n[[File:Jerome and Gregory.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jerome]] and Gregory]]\n\nOn his father's death, Gregory converted his family ''villa'' into a [[monastery]] dedicated to [[Andrew the Apostle]] (after his death it was rededicated as [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio]]). In his life of contemplation, Gregory concluded that \"in that silence of the heart, while we keep watch within through contemplation, we are as if asleep to all things that are without.\".<ref>Cavadini pg 155</ref>\n\nGregory took seriously the monk's vow of poverty.  Thus, when it came to light that a monk lying on his death bed had  stolen three gold pieces, Gregory, as a remedial punishment, forced the monk to die alone, then threw his body and coins on a manure heap to rot with a condemnation, \"Take your money with you to perdition\". Gregory believed that punishment of sins can begin, even in this life before death.<ref>Straw pg 47</ref> However, in time, after the monk's death, Gregory had 30 Masses offered for the man to [[Prayer for the dead|assist his soul]] before the [[final judgment]].\n\nEventually, [[Pope Pelagius II]] ordained Gregory a [[deacon]] and solicited his help in trying to heal the [[schism of the Three Chapters]] in [[northern Italy]]. However, this schism was not healed until well after Gregory was gone.<ref>Gregory the great and his world pg 3</ref>\n\nGregory had a deep respect for the monastic life. He viewed being a monk as the 'ardent quest for the vision of our Creator.'<ref>Markus- pg 69</ref> His three paternal aunts were nuns renowned for their sanctity. However, after the [[Trasilla and Emiliana|two eldest]] died after seeing a vision of their ancestor [[Pope Felix III]], the youngest soon abandoned the religious life and married the steward of her estate. Gregory's response to this family scandal was \"many are called but few are chosen.\"<ref>Consul of God, Richards.

Papal representatives who pressed their claims with excessive vigor could quickly become a nuisance and find themselves excluded from the imperial presence altogether\".<ref name=\"e10\"/> Gregory had already drawn an imperial rebuke for his lengthy canonical writings on the subject of the legitimacy of [[John III Scholasticus]], who had occupied the Patriarchate of Constantinople for twelve years prior to the return of [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople|Eutychius]] (who had been driven out by Justinian).<ref name=\"e10\"/> Gregory turned himself to cultivating connections with the Byzantine elite of the city, where he became extremely popular with the city's upper class, \"especially aristocratic women\".<ref name=\"e10\"/> Ekonomou surmises that \"while Gregory may have become spiritual father to a large and important segment of Constantinople's aristocracy, this relationship did not significantly advance the interests of Rome before the emperor\".<ref name=\"e10\"/> Although the writings of John the Deacon claim that Gregory \"labored diligently for the relief of Italy\", there is no evidence that his tenure accomplished much towards any of the objectives of Pelagius II.<ref>Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nGregory's theological disputes with Patriarch Eutychius would leave a \"bitter taste for the theological speculation of the East\" with Gregory that continued to influence him well into his own papacy.<ref name=\"e11\">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 11.</ref> According to Western sources, Gregory's very public debate with Eutychius culminated in an exchange before [[Tiberius II]] where Gregory cited a biblical passage (\"''Palpate et videte, quia spiritus carnem et ossa non-habet, sicut me videtis habere'', or \"touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/bible/luk024.htm Luke 24:39] \u2013 \"touch me, and look; a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.\"</ref>) in support of the view that Christ was corporeal and palpable after his Resurrection; allegedly as a result of this exchange, Tiberius II ordered Eutychius's writings burned.<ref name=\"e11\"/> Ekonomou views this argument, though exaggerated in Western sources, as Gregory's \"one achievement of an otherwise fruitless ''apokrisiariat''\".<ref name=\"e12\">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 12.</ref> In reality, Gregory was forced to rely on Scripture because he could not read the untranslated Greek authoritative works.<ref name=\"e12\"/> \n\t \nGregory left Constantinople for Rome in 585, returning to his monastery on the [[Caelian Hill]].<ref name=\"e13\">Ekonomou, 2007, p. 13.</ref> Gregory was elected by [[acclamation]] to succeed Pelagius II in 590, when the latter died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] spreading through the city.<ref name=\"e13\"/> Gregory was approved by an Imperial ''[[iussio]]'' from Constantinople the following September (as was the norm during the [[Byzantine Papacy]]).<ref name=\"e13\"/>\n\n===Controversy with Eutychius===\nIn Constantinople, Gregory took issue with the aged [[Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople]], who had recently published a treatise, now lost, on the [[Resurrection of the dead|General Resurrection]]. Eutychius maintained that the resurrected body \"will be more subtle than air, and no longer palpable\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines: Being a Continuation of 'The Dictionary of the Bible': VolumeII Eaba \u2013 Hermocrates|first=William|last=Smith|author2=Henry Wace|year=1880|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston|pages=415}} The dictionary account is apparently based on [[Bede]], Book II, Chapter 1, who used the expression \"...impalpable, of finer texture than wind and air.\"</ref> Gregory opposed with the palpability of the risen Christ in {{bibleverse||Luke|24:39|KJV}}. As the dispute could not be settled, the [[Byzantine emperor]], [[Tiberius II Constantine]], undertook to arbitrate. He decided in favor of palpability and ordered Eutychius' book to be [[book burning|burned]]. Shortly after both Gregory and Eutychius became ill; Gregory recovered, but Eutychius died on 5 April 582, at age 70. On his deathbed Eutychius recanted impalpability and Gregory dropped the matter. Tiberius also died a few months after Eutychius.\n\n==Papacy==\n{{Infobox popestyles\n|image      = \n|dipstyle   = [[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle   = Your Holiness\n|relstyle   = Holy Father\n|deathstyle = Saint\n}}\nGregory was more inclined to remain retired into the monastic lifestyle of contemplation.<ref>Straw pg 25</ref> In texts of all genres, especially those produced in his first year as pope, Gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of\nprayer he had once enjoyed as a monk.<ref>Cavadini pg 39</ref>\nWhen he became pope in 590, among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of Peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks. At that time, for various reasons, the [[Holy See]] had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of [[Pope Gelasius I|Gelasius I]]. The episcopacy in [[Gaul]] was drawn from the great territorial families, and identified with them: the parochial horizon of Gregory's contemporary, [[Gregory of Tours]], may be considered typical; in [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] Spain the bishops had little contact with Rome; in Italy the territories which had ''de facto'' fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent [[Lombards|Lombard]] dukes and the rivalry of the Byzantines in the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and in the south.\n\nPope Gregory had strong convictions on missions: \"Almighty God places good men in authority that He may impart through them the gifts of His mercy to their subjects. And this we find to be the case with the British over whom you have been appointed to rule, that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also.\"<ref>Dudden pg 124</ref> He is credited with re-energizing the Church's missionary work among the non-Christian peoples of northern Europe. He is most famous for sending a mission, often called the [[Gregorian mission]], under [[Augustine of Canterbury]], prior of Saint Andrew's, where he had perhaps succeeded Gregory, to evangelize the pagan [[Anglo-Saxons]] of England. It seems that the pope had never forgotten the English slaves whom he had once seen in the Roman Forum.<ref>Dudden pg 99</ref> The mission was successful, and it was from England that missionaries later set out for the Netherlands and Germany. The preaching of non-heretical Christian faith and the\nelimination of all deviations from it was a key element in Gregory's worldview, and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate.<ref name=\"Richards pg 228\">Richards pg 228</ref>\n\nAccording to Gilbert Huddleston, he was [[canonization|declared a saint]] immediately after his death by \"popular acclamation\".<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n\nIn his official documents, Gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term \"[[Servant of the Servants of God]]\" (''servus servorum Dei'') as a papal title, thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Servus servorum Dei}}</ref>\n\n===Alms===\n[[Alms]] in Christianity is defined by passages of the [[New Testament]] such as [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 19:21, which commands \"...go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor ... and come and follow me.\" A [[donation]] on the other hand is a gift to some sort of enterprise, profit or non-profit.\n\nOn the one hand the alms of Gregory are to be distinguished from his donations, but on the other he himself probably saw no such distinction. The church had no interest in secular profit and as pope Gregory did his utmost to encourage that high standard among church personnel. Apart from maintaining its facilities and supporting its personnel the church gave most of the donations it received as alms.\n\nGregory is known for his administrative system of charitable relief of the poor at Rome. They were predominantly refugees from the incursions of the [[Lombards]]. The philosophy under which he devised this system is that the wealth belonged to the poor and the church was only its steward. He received lavish donations from the wealthy families of Rome, who, following his own example, were eager, by doing so, to expiate their sins. He gave alms equally as lavishly both individually and en masse. He wrote in letters:<ref>Dudden (1905) page 316.</ref>\n\n:\"I have frequently charged you ... to act as my representative ... to relieve the poor in their distress ....\"\n:\"... I hold the office of steward to the property of the poor ....\"\n\nThe church received donations of many different kinds of [[property]]: [[consumables]] such as food and clothing; investment property: real estate and works of art; and [[capital goods]], or [[revenue]]-generating property, such as the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[latifundia]], or agricultural estates, staffed and operated by [[slave]]s, donated by Gregory and his family. The church already had a system for circulating the consumables to the poor: associated with each parish was a ''diaconium'' or office of the [[deacon]]. He was given a building from which the poor could at any time apply for assistance.<ref>Later these deacons became cardinals and from the oratories attached to the buildings grew churches.</ref><ref>{{cite book |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofchri01smit/page/549 549] under diaconia|title=A dictionary of Christian antiquities: Comprising the History, Institutions, and Antiquities of the Christian Church, from the Time of the Apostles to the Age of Charlemagne|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofchri01smit|first=William|last=Smith|authorlink=William Smith (lexicographer)|author2=Samuel Cheetham |authorlink2=Samuel Cheetham (priest) |publisher=J. Murray|year=1875}}</ref>\n\nThe state in which Gregory became pope in 590 was a ruined one. The Lombards held the better part of Italy. Their predations had brought the economy to a standstill. They camped nearly at the gates of Rome. The city was packed with refugees from all walks of life, who lived in the streets and had few of the necessities of life. The seat of government was far from Rome in [[Constantinople]], which appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail.\n[[File:Mass_of_St._Gregory,_c._1490,_attributed_to_Diego_de_la_Cruz,_oil_and_gold_on_panel_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', c. 1490, attributed to Diego de la Cruz, oil and gold on panel ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\nIn 590, Gregory could wait for Constantinople no longer. He organized the resources of the church into an administration for general relief. In doing so he evidenced a talent for and intuitive understanding of the principles of accounting, which was not to be invented for centuries. The church already had basic accounting documents: every [[expense]] was recorded in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|journals]] called ''regesta'', \"lists\" of amounts, recipients and circumstances. Revenue was recorded in ''polyptici'', \"[[Bookkeeping|books]]\". Many of these polyptici were [[ledger]]s recording the operating expenses of the church and the [[asset]]s, the ''patrimonia''. A central papal administration, the ''notarii'', under a chief, the ''primicerius notariorum'', kept the ledgers and issued ''brevia patrimonii'', or lists of property for which each ''[[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]'' was responsible.<ref>{{cite book |pages=322|title=The Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages: Volume X|first=Horace Kinder|last=Mann|author2=Johannes Hollnsteiner|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., Ltd.|location=London|year=1914}}</ref>\n\nGregory began by aggressively requiring his churchmen to seek out and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not. In a letter to a subordinate in [[Sicily]] he wrote: \"I asked you most of all to take care of the poor. And if you knew of people in poverty, you should have pointed them out ... I desire that you give the woman, Pateria, forty [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] for the children's shoes and forty bushels of grain ....\"<ref>Ambrosini & Willis (1996) pages 66\u201367.</ref> Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.<ref name=dud248>Dudden (1905) pages 248\u2013249.</ref>\n\nMoney, however, was no substitute for food in a city that was on the brink of famine. Even the wealthy were going hungry in their villas. The church now owned between {{convert|1300|and|1800|sqmi|km2}} of revenue-generating farmland divided into large sections called ''patrimonia.'' It produced goods of all kinds, which were sold, but Gregory intervened and had the goods shipped to Rome for distribution in the ''diaconia''. He gave orders to step up production, set quotas and put an administrative structure in place to carry it out. At the bottom was the ''rusticus'' who produced the goods. Some rustici were or owned slaves. He turned over part of his produce to a ''conductor'' from whom he leased the land. The latter reported to an ''actionarius'', the latter to a ''defensor'' and the latter to a ''rector''. Grain, wine, cheese, meat, fish and oil began to arrive at Rome in large quantities, where it was given away for nothing as alms.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of the Medieval Church, 590\u20131500|first=Margaret|last=Deanesly|publisher=Routledge|year=1969|location=London, New York|isbn=9780415039598|pages=22\u201324}}</ref>\n\nDistributions to qualified persons were monthly. However, a certain proportion of the population lived in the streets or were too ill or infirm to pick up their monthly food supply. To them Gregory sent out a small army of charitable persons, mainly monks, every morning with prepared food. It is said that he would not dine until the indigent were fed. When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.<ref name=dud248/>\n\nThese and other good deeds and charitable frame of mind completely won the hearts and minds of the Roman people. They now looked to the papacy for government, ignoring the rump state at Constantinople, which had only disrespect for Gregory,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} calling him a fool for his pacifist dealings with the Lombards. The office of urban prefect went without candidates. From the time of Gregory the Great to the rise of [[Italian nationalism]] the papacy was most influential presence in Italy.\n\n==Works==\n===Liturgical reforms===\nJohn the Deacon wrote that Pope Gregory I made a general revision of the liturgy of the [[Pre-Tridentine Mass]], \"removing many things, changing a few, adding some\". In letters, Gregory remarks that he moved the ''[[Pater Noster]]'' (Our Father) to immediately after the [[Roman Canon]] and immediately before the [[Fraction (religion)|Fraction]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT487&dq=Pope+Gregory+I+%2B+Liturgical+reforms&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIlcuAnaPfAhWqT98KHYtxCSw4ChDoAQgzMAI#v=onepage&q=Pope%20Gregory%20I%20%2B%20Liturgical%20reforms&f=false Eden, Bradford L. \"Gregory I, Pope\", ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'', (Christopher Kleinhenz, ed.), Routledge, 2004]{{ISBN|9781135948801}}</ref> This position is still maintained today in the Roman Liturgy. The pre-Gregorian position is evident in the [[Ambrosian Rite]]. Gregory added material to the ''[[Roman Canon#Hanc Igitur|Hanc Igitur]]'' of the Roman Canon and established the nine ''[[Kyrie]]s'' (a vestigial remnant of the [[litany]] which was originally at that place) at the beginning of [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. He also reduced the role of deacons in the Roman Liturgy.\n\n[[Sacramentary|Sacramentaries]] directly influenced by Gregorian reforms are referred to as ''Sacrementaria Gregoriana''. Roman and other [[Latin liturgical rites|Western liturgies]] since this era have a number of prayers that change to reflect the feast or liturgical season; these variations are visible in the [[collect]]s and [[preface]]s as well as in the Roman Canon itself.\n\n====Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts====\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], Gregory is credited as the primary influence in constructing the more penitential [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]], a fully separate form of the [[Divine Liturgy]] in the [[Byzantine Rite]] adapted to the needs of the season of [[Great Lent]]. Its [[Roman Rite]] equivalent is the [[Mass of the Presanctified]] used only on [[Good Friday]]. The [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts continues to be used in the [[Malankara Rite]], a variant of the [[West Syrian Rite]] historically practiced in the [[Malankara Church]] of [[India]], and now practiced by the several churches that descended from it and at some occasions in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].<ref>Chupungco, Anscar J.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 17 February 2006. Ste was created by David Hanson and was originally intended to be a short-term character for seven episodes. The following series producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back on a permanent basis. As of 2010, Richardson has revealed that he is committed to staying in the serial. In April 2017, Richardson began taking small breaks from the show due to paternity leave, and made a full-time return on 18 December 2017. In October 2019 it was confirmed that Richardson will take a break from the show departing on 20 November 2019. \n\nSte has been at the centre of several storylines including joyriding, domestic abuse, a baby kidnapping plot, drug dealing, HIV, far right radicalisation and a gay relationship. He was initially portrayed as a \"bad boy\" type character. Although he changed, producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] wanted him to revert. The issue of [[domestic violence]] has been portrayed through the character on two occasions: the first was his violence towards girlfriend [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]), and the second when he suffered abuse from his boyfriend [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Richardson and co-star Slanina-Davies both fronted an anti-domestic abuse campaign called \"Expect Respect\" for [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]]. He has subsequent relationships with [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]) and [[Noah Baxter]] (Law Thompson) which become subject to love \"triangle\" storylines involving Brendan. Ste's gay storyline prompted Richardson to [[coming out|come out]] as gay. Its aim was to raise awareness of domestic abuse in a homosexual relationship. Whilst Ste and his storylines have received a mixed reaction from critics, Richardson has been nominated for various awards for his portrayal.\n\nOn 9 February 2020, Richardson, during his break from the show, revealed his return scenes would be filmed on 22 March and expected to air in June.\n\n==Character creation and casting==\nThe character of Ste was originally a background character, who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes.<ref name=\"more\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html |title=More from Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vRcbHHt3?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html|url-status=live |archivedate=2 January 2011 }}</ref> Upon completion of his initial short stint, new producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back for another handful of episodes, in October 2006, in which Ste fled the scene of a car accident involving [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]).

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 17 February 2006. Ste was created by David Hanson and was originally intended to be a short-term character for seven episodes. The following series producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back on a permanent basis. As of 2010, Richardson has revealed that he is committed to staying in the serial. In April 2017, Richardson began taking small breaks from the show due to paternity leave, and made a full-time return on 18 December 2017. In October 2019 it was confirmed that Richardson will take a break from the show departing on 20 November 2019. \n\nSte has been at the centre of several storylines including joyriding, domestic abuse, a baby kidnapping plot, drug dealing, HIV, far right radicalisation and a gay relationship. He was initially portrayed as a \"bad boy\" type character. Although he changed, producer [[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] wanted him to revert. The issue of [[domestic violence]] has been portrayed through the character on two occasions: the first was his violence towards girlfriend [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]), and the second when he suffered abuse from his boyfriend [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]). Richardson and co-star Slanina-Davies both fronted an anti-domestic abuse campaign called \"Expect Respect\" for [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]]. He has subsequent relationships with [[Rae Wilson]] ([[Alice Barlow]]) and [[Noah Baxter]] (Law Thompson) which become subject to love \"triangle\" storylines involving Brendan. Ste's gay storyline prompted Richardson to [[coming out|come out]] as gay. Its aim was to raise awareness of domestic abuse in a homosexual relationship. Whilst Ste and his storylines have received a mixed reaction from critics, Richardson has been nominated for various awards for his portrayal.\n\nOn 9 February 2020, Richardson, during his break from the show, revealed his return scenes would be filmed on 22 March and expected to air in June.\n\n==Character creation and casting==\nThe character of Ste was originally a background character, who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes.<ref name=\"more\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html |title=More from Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |first=Daniel |last=Kilkelly |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vRcbHHt3?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/scoop/a282075/more-from-hollyoaks-star-kieron-richardson.html|url-status=live |archivedate=2 January 2011 }}</ref> Upon completion of his initial short stint, new producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] decided to bring the character back for another handful of episodes, in October 2006, in which Ste fled the scene of a car accident involving [[Amy Barnes]] ([[Ashley Slanina-Davies]]).
