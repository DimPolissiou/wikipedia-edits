This episode first aired in the [[United States]] on Sunday, August 12, 2007.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nAt a band meeting, Murray has some really good news: a gig in [[Central Park]].  Since they will, in Murray's opinion, need to be at the top of their game, he has organised a warm-up tour for them.  When Bret asks how they can afford to go on tour, Murray says he has dipped into the band's \"emergency fund\".  He flashes an envelope of cash but won't tell them where he got the money.\n\nIn the car on the way to their first gig, Murray gets a call from his wife Shelley.  They had been separated but are back together now.  Bret learns from his phone conversation that the 'emergency fund' came from their joint cheque account, and that Murray hadn't told his wife that he had taken it to use for the tour.  They also find out that Mel and Doug have been following their car.\n\nThe first gig of the tour turns out to be in dark lounge of a hotel next to [[LaGuardia Airport]].  After the gig, Murray gives the boys a [[per diem]] but is annoyed when he discovers they have spent all the money on leather suits.  He intended the \"per diem\" to last all week.  They try to give Murray a gift they had bought for him, but an annoyed Murray refuses without looking at it.\n\nUp in the hotel room, Jemaine is trying to watch TV; however, Bret has to hold it in the air in order to get a decent reception.  When his arms tire, he puts the TV down on the window sill, but it falls out the window. This results in Murray having to pay for a new TV out of the tour funds.  Later at the next gig in [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], Jemaine clumsily damages a club [[amplifier]], leaving Murray further out of pocket.\n\nWhen they turn up at their next gig, they find their reputation for damaging equipment has preceded them and the club owner turns them away.\n\nThat night at the bar, Bret and Jemaine are invited to sit with the members of the North Jersey University Women's [[Water Polo]] team.  After finding out they are in a band, the women ask for their autographs and suggest partying in the boys' room.  Bret and Jemaine head upstairs first and, on the way up to their room, sing \"Mermaid\".\n\nThe guys wait all night, with Murray banished to sleep in the bathroom, but the women do not show up.  The next morning, they discover that the team has used their autographs and room number to charge a large bar bill to the band's room.  To make things worse, Brett fails to put the [[parking brake]] on in Murray's car after parking it, causing it to slide into a swimming pool.\n\nA furious Murray quits as manager and storms off to walk home.  Left without a way home, Bret and Jemaine are forced to ask Mel and Doug for a lift.  When they catch up with Murray on the highway, they successfully manage to make up with him by giving him the gift they had bought for him earlier.  It turns out to be a leather suit just like theirs.\n\nThe happy threesome head for their final gig in 'Central Park'.  The band discovers, however, that Murray has misled them.  The gig turns out to be in \"a central park\" in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].\n\nThe concert is titled Newark Summer Jam '07.\n\nOver the end credits, we see Murray on his mobile phone trying to explain to his boss why he has been absent from work all week.\n\n==Notes==\n* Bret reveals his 'secret' last name<ref name=\"obswoman\">\n{{cite web |last=Vernon |first=Polly |title=The accidental sex gods |accessdate=2008-02-11 |work=[[The Observer]] |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/woman/story/0,,2253281,00.html |date=2008-02-10}}</ref> - McClegnie - a scrambled version of the actor's real name.\n* We learn that the name of Murray's wife is Shelley.\n* Becky of the water polo team has the same trouble with Bret's first name that Coco does in the \"[[Bret Gives Up The Dream]]\" episode.\n* The name of the band is misspelt on the information board at the gig in the lounge of a hotel at LaGuardia Airport.

This episode first aired in the [[United States]] on Sunday, September 2, 2007.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nBret and Jemaine arrive at Murray's office for a band meeting to discover that Murray has hired a  bongo player ([[Todd Barry]]) without consulting them.\nAstonished, they demand Murray fire him, but Murray convinces them to give Todd a chance.\n\nAt band rehearsal they discover that Todd the bongo player has a tendency to launch into long bongo solos, which they try to persuade him out of.  Todd wants them to try one of the songs he has written about dogs, but they are not impressed.\n\nAfter their first gig together &mdash; at which Todd has again launched into a long bongo solo &mdash; they try to convince Murray that Todd has to go because he is not \"cool\".  But Murray refuses because Todd is popular and is bringing the band more fans.  Despite this, the next day Jemaine attempts to fire him, but Todd's powers of persuasion are too much for him and he ends up firing Bret instead. Bret then does his angry dance.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to weasel his way back into the band, Bret gives up and forms a new band of his own \"The Original Flight of the Conchords\" with a [[keytar]] player he has met named Demitri ([[Demetri Martin]]).  Despite Murray's reluctance to manage both bands, they are surprised to discover that the two new incarnations of The Conchords are more successful than Bret and Jemaine ever were.  Bret and Jemaine are still not pleased, however, since neither of them are getting along that well with their respective band-mates.\n\nAfter a very successful gig in which \"Flight of the Conchords\" is the [[opening act]] for \"The Original Flight of the Conchords\", a pleased Murray suggests that the two bands merge to form a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]].  Instead Todd and Demetri announce that they want to split from Bret and Jemaine and team up together to form the \"Crazy Dogggz\".\n\nOne month later, the song Todd had tried to get the Conchords to play, \"Doggy Bounce\", is number one in 24 countries.  The Crazy Dogggz are touring the world and a busy and now-rich Murray is neglecting the Conchords.  Even worse, their once-devoted fan Mel has also switched allegiance to the other band. The episode ends with Bret and Jemaine doing the angry dance.\n\n==Songs==\nThe following songs were featured in this episode:\n\n===\"Bret's Angry Dance\"===\nThis song is an instrumental, and is played when Bret starts dancing to vent his anger on being fired from the band. The dance closely follows the style of [[Kevin Bacon]]'s angry dance in ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''.  The song is reprised over the closing credits, with Bret and Jemaine dancing.\n\n===\"Doggy Bounce\"===\nOnly one new song appears in this episode and it is not, at least in a plot sense, a Conchords song. The Crazy Dogggz song \"Doggy Bounce\", sung by Todd and Demetri, features somewhat childish lyrics set to a simple melody. The music video for it, which Bret and Jemaine watch on television, features Todd and Demitri in suits accompanied by four female dancers wearing doggy ears. It resembles very closely the \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\" music video by [[Los del Rio]] from 1996.<ref name=\"macarena\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgl7st70jek Los del Rio - \"Macarena\"] ([[YouTube]])</ref>  Murray's [[English bulldog]], Toby, also makes an appearance.\n\nIn the next episode, the first episode of season two, we learn that Todd [[plagiarize]]d this song from a Polish band.\n\n===Other songs===\nDuring the scenes in which the various incarnations of the band are performing, we see snippets of \"[[Robots]]\".\n\n==Cultural references==\nEarly in the episode Bret mentions to Jemaine that he sometimes dances \"when he is angry\".  Later in the episode we see Bret launch into an elaborate dance sequence mimicking the Kevin Bacon dance from the 1984 film ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMB8vv18ehE Kenny Loggins - \"Footloose\"] Music video featuring dance sequence from ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'' ([[YouTube]])</ref>  During the end credits both Bret and Jemaine begin the same dance.\n\nIn one scene, Jemaine and Todd arrive at Murray's office wearing leather jackets.  Murray remarks that \"the Fonzies have arrived\" referring to the character  [[Fonzie]] played by [[Henry Winkler]] from the 1970s TV series ''[[Happy Days]]''.\n\nThe title is a reference to the concept of a [[Fifth Beatle]].\n\nAfter a gig, Murray makes a reference to the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], relating his \"coolness\" to that of Todd's.\n\nThe band name Crazy Dogggz refers to the band Wylde Ratttz from the 1998 film ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]''.

It originally aired on Wednesday, January 9, 2008 on the [[The CW Television Network|CW]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter Gossip Girl posts a picture of Serena looking at pregnancy tests, everyone thinks that she must be [[pregnant]]. Jenny, Dan, and Rufus see the news online, and Dan worries about what's the right thing to say. After hearing about the Gossip Girl blast while with Eric, Serena runs into a frazzled Dan who blurts out that he loves her. Serena tells him that she's not pregnant, and goes to find Blair. It's revealed that Serena bought the test for her because Blair mentioned that her period was late. Blair refuses to take the test since everything is going so well in her life. Including her reinforced relationship with Nate. Dan tells Rufus about what happened between him and Serena, and he says that it's a good thing it was just a scare, because they need to take some time and slow down. Jenny tells Dan that if he really does love Serena, he should tell her again in a more personal way.\n\nWhile having dinner together in the Humphrey's apartment, Serena tells Dan everything about Blair's current situation.

It originally aired on Wednesday, January 9, 2008 on the [[The CW Television Network|CW]].\n\n==Plot==\nAfter Gossip Girl posts a picture of Serena looking at pregnancy tests, everyone thinks that she must be [[pregnant]]. Jenny, Dan, and Rufus see the news online, and Dan worries about what's the right thing to say. After hearing about the Gossip Girl blast while with Eric, Serena runs into a frazzled Dan who blurts out that he loves her. Serena tells him that she's not pregnant, and goes to find Blair. It's revealed that Serena bought the test for her because Blair mentioned that her period was late. Blair refuses to take the test since everything is going so well in her life. Including her reinforced relationship with Nate. Dan tells Rufus about what happened between him and Serena, and he says that it's a good thing it was just a scare, because they need to take some time and slow down. Jenny tells Dan that if he really does love Serena, he should tell her again in a more personal way.\n\nWhile having dinner together in the Humphrey's apartment, Serena tells Dan everything about Blair's current situation. Dan explains that even though Chuck is a jerk, he deserves to know about what's going on. Serena later visits Chuck at his hotel room, who informs her that Nate and Blair have already slept together. She confronts Blair over her dishonesty. Making a point by saying she took a public bullet getting the test for her.

{"title_page": "Animal roleplay", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date = September 2017}}\n\n\n'''Animal roleplay''' is a form of [[Sexual roleplay|roleplay]] where at least one participant plays the part of a non-human [[animal]]. As with most forms of roleplay, its uses include [[play (BDSM)|play]] and [[psychodrama]].\n\nAnimal roleplay may also be found in [[BDSM]] contexts, where an individual may take part in a dominant/submissive relationship by being treated as an animal. The activity is often referred to as ''petplay''. However, not all types of animal roleplay within BDSM are petplay and not all petplay in BDSM involves roleplaying as an animal; some can be referred to as primal play and is not related or accepted by the [[furry fandom]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Walking the dog (2603306717).jpg|thumb|150px|A man crawling like a pet animal at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. He is held using a dog [[leash]].]]\nThe origins of animal [[roleplay]] and petplay are probably various and diverse, again depending upon the participants involved.  However, its origins are certainly influenced by [[Creature suit|costuming]], [[fiction]], [[mythology|myth]] and [[legend]], roleplay and [[psychodrama]] in their various aspects. Some of the earliest published images of animal play (especially pony play) are to be found in the work of [[John Willie]], primarily in ''[[John Willie#John Willie's Work and Bizarre|Bizarre]]'' magazine published from 1946 to 1959.\n\nSome of the equipment that can be used in animal roleplay include [[leash]], [[chain]], [[Gag (BDSM)#Bit|bit gag]], [[collar (BDSM)|neck collar]], [[bondage harness]], [[catsuit]], [[bodystocking]], [[Butt plug#Fetish plugs|butt plug]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzle]], [[ballet boot]]s, etc.<ref name=Taormino2012>{{cite book|last1=Taormino|first1=Tristan|title=The ultimate guide to kink : BDSM, role play, and the erotic edge|date=2012|publisher=Cleis Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9781573447829|chapter=Chapter 12. A romp on the wild side: erotic human animal roleplaying}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural and ritual use===\n{{see also|Therianthropy}}\nNon-sexual animal roleplay was a common and integral part of [[ritual]] in many tribal cultures both in recent and likely prehistoric times, where a member (or members) of the tribe would take the role physically and often spiritually of an animal that was either revered or hunted. Examples of the former include many of the [[American Indian tribes]] and [[Inuit|Arctic native peoples]]. Examples of the latter are evidenced by [[cave painting]]s. In 1911, [[Julia Tuell]] photographed the last Animal Dance (\"[[Massaum]]\") performed by the Northern [[Cheyenne]] of [[Montana]].\n\nIt is also sometimes used in [[education]], especially [[physical education]], as a way to encourage people to [[exercise]] the body in unusual ways, by [[mimic]]king various animals.\n\n==Other forms==\n{{see also|Play (activity)}}\n\nSome [[superhero]]es, [[heroine]]s, and [[villain]]s also feature elements related to pet play; such as [[DC Comics]]'s [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Catwoman]], [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Tigra]], [[Man-Wolf]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], or even [[Nastassja Kinski]]'s Irena Gallier in the 1982 film ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'' (a remake of the [[Cat People (1942 film)|1942 Simone Simon film]]), and Miss Kitty from the [[Brendan Fraser]] movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''.  All involve animal qualities taken on by a human.  Some would even count the enactment or spiritual belief in therianthropy ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[werecat]]s, etc.) as falling under human animal roleplay or transformation play as well.\n\n[[Peter Shaffer]]'s 1973 play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' tells the story of a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses, but this appears closer to zoophilia than pet play. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s 1981 musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' traces a tribe of urban cats, and in 2007 ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]'' used full size puppets to play horses on stage.\n\n==Erotic scenarios==\n[[File:London Pride 2011 (5929826433).jpg|thumb|120px|A man dressed as a dog at [[Pride in London|Pride Parade, London, 2011]].]]\n\nLike much of erotic play and roleplay, animal roleplay in an erotic or relational context is entirely defined by the people involved and by their mood and interests at the time of play. It ranges from the simple imitation of a vocal \"whinnying\" of a horse to the barking, panting or playful nudging of a puppy, or playful behaviour of a kitten, to crawling around on all fours and being fed, or petted, by hand. To the greater extremes of dressing up as a pony in modified horse tack, masks, [[prosthetic]]s and temporary bondage based body modification (such as binding the forearms to the upperarms and/or the calves to the thighs).\n\nPublic participation in human animal roleplay is varied. A couple could inconspicuously role-play a pet play scene in public, which would look to the casual observer like one partner is merely stroking the other's neck. In the case of some BDSM [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]ists, one partner may wear a [[Collar (BDSM)|dog collar]] with a [[leash]] attached.\n\nThe reasons for playing such a character or animal can vary as much as the physical manifestations and intensity of the play.  Some people enjoy being able to \"cut loose\" into a different, or more dynamic personality (see [[#Other variations|other variations]]).  In some cases, pet play is seen as a loving, quiet cuddling time where there is no need for verbalizations and the simple act of stroking, rubbing and holding the other partner is satisfying or reassuring in and of itself for those involved.  For others, there may be a [[spirituality|spiritual]] side to it.  Some feel closer to their animal [[totem]], while others may identify with something akin to a deeper side or part of their own psyche (known as [[Therianthropy#Psychiatric aspects|therianthropy]]).  For still others, there is the experience of [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] setup in a context or structure which they can accept.\n\nSome cases could be considered a type of animal transformation fantasy. They can have strong elements of [[exhibitionism]], be totally enjoyed in the privacy of the home, or lie somewhere between either boundary. While not widespread, erotic human-animal roleplay is still enjoyed by a sizable number of people. However, it is still primarily identified with [[BDSM]] practice. Though commonly misinterpreted as being associated with [[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|furry]] or other [[alternative lifestyle]] activities, that is generally not the case though some instances may exist.\n\nFor most participants, it has no connection whatsoever with [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], which is controversial and would usually be considered [[edgeplay]] in BDSM circles.\n\n{{Anchor|Autozoophilia}}\n'''Autozoophilia''' is sexual arousal that depends on acting out or imagining one's self as an animal. [[Paraphilia|Paraphilic interest]]s that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s (ETLEs), and autozoophilia would represent an [[autoerotic]] form of [[zoophilia]].<ref name=\"lawrence\">Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An underappreciated paraphilic dimension. ''Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.</ref> Autozoophilia is mostly practised by wearing an animal costume, such as a [[latex mask]], [[mascot|mascot costume]] or [[fursuit]].\n\n===Other considerations===\nEach type of play can focus on a certain \"strength\" of an animal character.  Pony play often involves the practice and training that a [[horse]] owner or [[horse trainer|trainer]] would put their horse through to learn how to walk, [[canter]], etc., as modified for human limbs.  Puppy and kitten play often can involve BDSM related discipline.  Cow Play often involves fantasies of [[lactation]] and [[impregnation]].  The usual limits of [[safe, sane and consensual]] apply to roleplay as much as any other activity between humans who accept and respect their partner's interests and limits. For most, this does not include bestiality.\n\nNote: Just because one partner is playing the \"pet\" does not necessarily make them the passive or submissive play partner in the [[scene (BDSM)|scene]].\n\n===BDSM scenarios===\nSome people believe that they have certain animal '[[instinct]]s' and through animal roleplay can let them out. This is especially true in the BDSM communities, where some people 'live' as their chosen animal 24/7.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This type of mentality goes beyond roleplay and becomes a full lifestyle for the parties involved. There are also 'hybrids'. These are humans who live part-time as one type of animal, and part-time as another. This is usually determined by the situation.\n\nIn the BDSM scene, people engage in animal roleplay to build stronger emotional connections. People develop deep emotional connections with their pets. Petplay, especially pup and kitten play seeks to create the same deep emotional connection between the owner/master and submissive/pet. The dom may demand unconditional love and obedience, but they may also train their pet to be more emotionally perceptive and empathic. This helps the sub feel safe and secure in the relationship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Petplay: Training with Hypnosis and Meditation|url=https://www.hypnoticdreams.com/petplay-training-hypnosis-and-meditation/|access-date=2019-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626180216/https://www.hypnoticdreams.com/petplay-training-hypnosis-and-meditation/|archive-date=2019-06-26|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\n=={{Anchor|Human pony|Pony play}} Pony play==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

If there is a dominant role it can be  taken by a \"handler\", \"trainer\", \"master\", or in the case of someone who also identifies as a pup, an \"alpha\". Not all \"pups\" or \"dogs\" are \"alpha\", some consider themselves \"beta\" or \"omega\", and as in the canine world hierarchy, \"beta\" can refer to someone who has both dominant and submissive or service oriented tendencies depending on the situation where \"omega\" generally indicates a more submissive, passive, service oriented and playful nature. Unlike other forms of animal roleplay, it is not uncommon for two or more pups to play together as equals, possibly fight for dominance, or play where one is clearly the \"alpha\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-an-alpha/|title=What is an Alpha?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919160112/http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-an-alpha/|archive-date=19 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPuppy play is often about being playful, mischievous, cheeky and instinctive.<ref>[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ Dog play in the BDSM Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511083559/http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ |date=May 11, 2008 }} accessed 4 July 2008</ref> Many human puppies like to simplify their desires and motivations as they embrace the side of themselves that acts solely on instinct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-human-pup-play/|title=What is human pup play?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826194221/http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-human-pup-play/|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \nA great deal of animal role play occurs socially. A group of like-minded pet-players will gather at events specifically organised for social pet play.

As with most forms of roleplay, its uses include [[play (BDSM)|play]] and [[psychodrama]].\n\nAnimal roleplay may also be found in [[BDSM]] contexts, where an individual may take part in a dominant/submissive relationship by being treated as an animal. The activity is often referred to as ''petplay''. However, not all types of animal roleplay within BDSM are petplay and not all petplay in BDSM involves roleplaying as an animal; some can be referred to as primal play and is not related or accepted by the [[furry fandom]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Walking the dog (2603306717).jpg|thumb|150px|A man crawling like a pet animal at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. He is held using a dog [[leash]].]]\nThe origins of animal [[roleplay]] and petplay are probably various and diverse, again depending upon the participants involved.  However, its origins are certainly influenced by [[Creature suit|costuming]], [[fiction]], [[mythology|myth]] and [[legend]], roleplay and [[psychodrama]] in their various aspects. Some of the earliest published images of animal play (especially pony play) are to be found in the work of [[John Willie]], primarily in ''[[John Willie#John Willie's Work and Bizarre|Bizarre]]'' magazine published from 1946 to 1959.\n\nSome of the equipment that can be used in animal roleplay include [[leash]], [[chain]], [[Gag (BDSM)#Bit|bit gag]], [[collar (BDSM)|neck collar]], [[bondage harness]], [[catsuit]], [[bodystocking]], [[Butt plug#Fetish plugs|butt plug]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzle]], [[ballet boot]]s, etc.<ref name=Taormino2012>{{cite book|last1=Taormino|first1=Tristan|title=The ultimate guide to kink : BDSM, role play, and the erotic edge|date=2012|publisher=Cleis Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9781573447829|chapter=Chapter 12. A romp on the wild side: erotic human animal roleplaying}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural and ritual use===\n{{see also|Therianthropy}}\nNon-sexual animal roleplay was a common and integral part of [[ritual]] in many tribal cultures both in recent and likely prehistoric times, where a member (or members) of the tribe would take the role physically and often spiritually of an animal that was either revered or hunted. Examples of the former include many of the [[American Indian tribes]] and [[Inuit|Arctic native peoples]]. Examples of the latter are evidenced by [[cave painting]]s. In 1911, [[Julia Tuell]] photographed the last Animal Dance (\"[[Massaum]]\") performed by the Northern [[Cheyenne]] of [[Montana]].\n\nIt is also sometimes used in [[education]], especially [[physical education]], as a way to encourage people to [[exercise]] the body in unusual ways, by [[mimic]]king various animals.\n\n==Other forms==\n{{see also|Play (activity)}}\n\nSome [[superhero]]es, [[heroine]]s, and [[villain]]s also feature elements related to pet play; such as [[DC Comics]]'s [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]], [[Catwoman]], [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Tigra]], [[Man-Wolf]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], or even [[Nastassja Kinski]]'s Irena Gallier in the 1982 film ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'' (a remake of the [[Cat People (1942 film)|1942 Simone Simon film]]), and Miss Kitty from the [[Brendan Fraser]] movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''.  All involve animal qualities taken on by a human.  Some would even count the enactment or spiritual belief in therianthropy ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[werecat]]s, etc.) as falling under human animal roleplay or transformation play as well.\n\n[[Peter Shaffer]]'s 1973 play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' tells the story of a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses, but this appears closer to zoophilia than pet play. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s 1981 musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' traces a tribe of urban cats, and in 2007 ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]'' used full size puppets to play horses on stage.\n\n==Erotic scenarios==\n[[File:London Pride 2011 (5929826433).jpg|thumb|120px|A man dressed as a dog at [[Pride in London|Pride Parade, London, 2011]].]]\n\nLike much of erotic play and roleplay, animal roleplay in an erotic or relational context is entirely defined by the people involved and by their mood and interests at the time of play. It ranges from the simple imitation of a vocal \"whinnying\" of a horse to the barking, panting or playful nudging of a puppy, or playful behaviour of a kitten, to crawling around on all fours and being fed, or petted, by hand. To the greater extremes of dressing up as a pony in modified horse tack, masks, [[prosthetic]]s and temporary bondage based body modification (such as binding the forearms to the upperarms and/or the calves to the thighs).\n\nPublic participation in human animal roleplay is varied. A couple could inconspicuously role-play a pet play scene in public, which would look to the casual observer like one partner is merely stroking the other's neck. In the case of some BDSM [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]ists, one partner may wear a [[Collar (BDSM)|dog collar]] with a [[leash]] attached.\n\nThe reasons for playing such a character or animal can vary as much as the physical manifestations and intensity of the play.  Some people enjoy being able to \"cut loose\" into a different, or more dynamic personality (see [[#Other variations|other variations]]).  In some cases, pet play is seen as a loving, quiet cuddling time where there is no need for verbalizations and the simple act of stroking, rubbing and holding the other partner is satisfying or reassuring in and of itself for those involved.  For others, there may be a [[spirituality|spiritual]] side to it.  Some feel closer to their animal [[totem]], while others may identify with something akin to a deeper side or part of their own psyche (known as [[Therianthropy#Psychiatric aspects|therianthropy]]).  For still others, there is the experience of [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] setup in a context or structure which they can accept.\n\nSome cases could be considered a type of animal transformation fantasy. They can have strong elements of [[exhibitionism]], be totally enjoyed in the privacy of the home, or lie somewhere between either boundary. While not widespread, erotic human-animal roleplay is still enjoyed by a sizable number of people. However, it is still primarily identified with [[BDSM]] practice. Though commonly misinterpreted as being associated with [[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|furry]] or other [[alternative lifestyle]] activities, that is generally not the case though some instances may exist.\n\nFor most participants, it has no connection whatsoever with [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], which is controversial and would usually be considered [[edgeplay]] in BDSM circles.\n\n{{Anchor|Autozoophilia}}\n'''Autozoophilia''' is sexual arousal that depends on acting out or imagining one's self as an animal. [[Paraphilia|Paraphilic interest]]s that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s (ETLEs), and autozoophilia would represent an [[autoerotic]] form of [[zoophilia]].<ref name=\"lawrence\">Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An underappreciated paraphilic dimension. ''Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.</ref> Autozoophilia is mostly practised by wearing an animal costume, such as a [[latex mask]], [[mascot|mascot costume]] or [[fursuit]].\n\n===Other considerations===\nEach type of play can focus on a certain \"strength\" of an animal character.  Pony play often involves the practice and training that a [[horse]] owner or [[horse trainer|trainer]] would put their horse through to learn how to walk, [[canter]], etc., as modified for human limbs.  Puppy and kitten play often can involve BDSM related discipline.  Cow Play often involves fantasies of [[lactation]] and [[impregnation]].  The usual limits of [[safe, sane and consensual]] apply to roleplay as much as any other activity between humans who accept and respect their partner's interests and limits. For most, this does not include bestiality.\n\nNote: Just because one partner is playing the \"pet\" does not necessarily make them the passive or submissive play partner in the [[scene (BDSM)|scene]].\n\n===BDSM scenarios===\nSome people believe that they have certain animal '[[instinct]]s' and through animal roleplay can let them out. This is especially true in the BDSM communities, where some people 'live' as their chosen animal 24/7.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This type of mentality goes beyond roleplay and becomes a full lifestyle for the parties involved. There are also 'hybrids'. These are humans who live part-time as one type of animal, and part-time as another. This is usually determined by the situation.\n\nIn the BDSM scene, people engage in animal roleplay to build stronger emotional connections. People develop deep emotional connections with their pets. Petplay, especially pup and kitten play seeks to create the same deep emotional connection between the owner/master and submissive/pet. The dom may demand unconditional love and obedience, but they may also train their pet to be more emotionally perceptive and empathic. This helps the sub feel safe and secure in the relationship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Petplay: Training with Hypnosis and Meditation|url=https://www.hypnoticdreams.com/petplay-training-hypnosis-and-meditation/|access-date=2019-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626180216/https://www.hypnoticdreams.com/petplay-training-hypnosis-and-meditation/|archive-date=2019-06-26|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\n=={{Anchor|Human pony|Pony play}} Pony play==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

If there is a dominant role it can be  taken by a \"handler\", \"trainer\", \"master\", or in the case of someone who also identifies as a pup, an \"alpha\". Not all \"pups\" or \"dogs\" are \"alpha\", some consider themselves \"beta\" or \"omega\", and as in the canine world hierarchy, \"beta\" can refer to someone who has both dominant and submissive or service oriented tendencies depending on the situation where \"omega\" generally indicates a more submissive, passive, service oriented and playful nature. Unlike other forms of animal roleplay, it is not uncommon for two or more pups to play together as equals, possibly fight for dominance, or play where one is clearly the \"alpha\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-an-alpha/|title=What is an Alpha?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919160112/http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-an-alpha/|archive-date=19 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPuppy play is often about being playful, mischievous, cheeky and instinctive.<ref>[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ Dog play in the BDSM Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511083559/http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ |date=May 11, 2008 }} accessed 4 July 2008</ref> Many human puppies like to simplify their desires and motivations as they embrace the side of themselves that acts solely on instinct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-human-pup-play/|title=What is human pup play?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826194221/http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-human-pup-play/|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> \nA great deal of animal role play occurs socially.
