It crashed into a field in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people on board were killed, including the four hijackers, but no one on the ground was injured.

The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. [[Ziad Jarrah]], who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of [[Washington, D.C.]], the U.S. capital.

Officials believe that at 09:28, the hijackers assaulted the cockpit and moved the passengers to the rear of the plane at the same time to minimize any chance that either the crew or the passengers would interfere with the attack.<ref name=\"Staff\" /> The other hijacked flights were taken by five-man teams, but Flight&nbsp;93 had only four hijackers, leading to speculation of a possible [[20th hijacker]]. The [[9/11 Commission]] believed that [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] was the likely candidate for this role, but was unable to participate as he had been denied entry into the United States one month earlier.<ref name=\"Chap1\" /> With many passengers saying in phone calls that they saw only three hijackers, the 9/11 Commission believed Jarrah remained seated until the crew were overpowered and passengers were moved to the back of the aircraft and then took over the flight controls out of sight of the passengers.<ref name=\"Chap1\" />\n\nThe flight recordings revealed that Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer LeRoy Homer survived the initial attack and were still alive after the hijackers took over the plane. Dahl and Homer took actions to interfere with the hijackers, including disengaging the autopilot just before the hijackers took over in order to prevent them from aiming the plane at Washington, D.C., and switching the output of the pilots' microphones from the cabin address speakers to the radio transmitter so that Jarrah's attempts to communicate with the passengers would instead be heard by air traffic controllers.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite news|last=Gonzales|first=Manny|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2006/04/12/flight-93-tape-horror-heroics/|title=Flight 93 tape: Horror, heroics|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=May 8, 2016}}</ref> Dahl \"stayed in the cockpit alone with the hijacker-pilot, injured but not dead\",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1838257 |title=Flight 93 Pilot's Wife Recalls Terror of Recording |date=April 13, 2006 |publisher=ABC News}}</ref> while Homer was \"knocked unconscious and dragged from the cockpit\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe flight transcript suggests that at least two hijackers were in the cockpit.
