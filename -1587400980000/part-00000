The defeat by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BC ended Sparta's prominent role, though it maintained its political independence until the [[Roman Greece|Roman conquest of Greece]] in [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|146 BC]]. It then underwent a long period of decline, especially in the [[Middle Ages]], when many Spartans moved to [[Mystras]]. [[Sparti|Modern Sparta]] is the capital of the Greek region of [[Laconia]] and a center for processing citrus and olives.\n\nSparta was unique in [[ancient Greece]] for its social system and [[constitution]] introduced by the almost mythical figure of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. He configured the entire society in order to maximize military proficiency at all costs, focusing all social institutions on military training and physical development. Its inhabitants were classified as [[Spartiate]]s (Spartan citizens with full rights), [[Mothax|mothakes]] (non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans), [[Perioeci|perioikoi]] (free residents engaged in commerce), and [[helots]] (state-owned serfs, enslaved non-Spartan local population). Spartiates underwent the rigorous ''[[agoge]]'' training and education regimen, and Spartan [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle. Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality with men than elsewhere in [[classical antiquity]].\n\nSparta was the subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in [[Western culture]] following the revival of classical learning. The admiration of Sparta is known as [[laconophilia|Laconism or Laconophilia]]. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote:<blockquote>Sparta had a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality, and through the myth.... The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato's political theory, and that of countless subsequent writers.... [The] ideals that it favors had a great part in framing the doctrines of Rousseau, Nietzsche, and National Socialism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of western philosophy|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=|isbn=978-1138127043|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter XII: The Influence of Sparta|oclc=931802632|date = 2015-08-27}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Names==\nThe earliest attested term referring to Lacedaemon is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc28\ud800\udc10\ud800\udc05\ud800\udc16\ud800\udc1b\ud800\udc0d}}, ''ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo'', \"Lacedaimonian\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script,<ref name=Palaeolexicon-rakedaminijo>{{cite web|website=Palaeolexicon.

The ancients sometimes used a back-formation, referring to the land of Lacedaemon as ''Lacedaemonian country''. As most words for \"country\" were feminine, the adjective was in the feminine: ''Lacedaemonia'' ({{lang|grc|\u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Lakedaimonia''). Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.\n\n\"Lacedaemonia\" was not in general use during the classical period and before. It does occur in Greek as an equivalent of Laconia and Messenia during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, mostly in ethnographers and lexica glossing place names. For example, [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s ''Lexicon'' (5th century AD) defines Agiadae as a \"place in Lacedaemonia\" named after Agis.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=s.v. \u1f08\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9 | encyclopedia=Hesychii Alexandrini Lexicon | editor-first=Maurice | editor-last=Schmidt | location=Jena | publisher=Frederick Mauk | year=1863|url= https://archive.org/stream/hesychiialexand00schmgoog#page/n24/mode/1up|language=Greek}}.

Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the [[Eurotas River]], the main river of Laconia, which provided it with a source of fresh water.  The valley of the Eurotas is a natural fortress, bounded to the west by [[Taygetus|Mt. Taygetus]] (2,407 m) and to the east by [[Parnon|Mt. Parnon]] (1,935 m).  To the north, Laconia is separated from [[Arcadia]] by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude.  These natural defenses worked to Sparta's advantage and contributed to Sparta never having been sacked.  Though landlocked, Sparta had a harbor, [[Gytheio]], on the Laconian Gulf.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[Lacedaemon (mythology)|Lacedaemon]] (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd}}) was a [[Greek mythology|mythical]] king of Laconia.<ref name=PausaniasIII.1.2>{{harvnb|Pausanias|1918|loc= Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D2 \u0399\u0399\u0399.1.2]}}.</ref> The son of [[Zeus]] by the nymph [[Taygete]],  he married [[Sparta (mythology)|Sparta]], the daughter of [[Eurotas (mythology)|Eurotas]], by whom he became the father of [[King Amyclas of Sparta|Amyclas]], [[Eurydice of Argos|Eurydice]], and Asine.  He named the country after himself and the city after his wife.<ref name=PausaniasIII.1.2/> He was believed to have built the sanctuary of the [[Charites]], which stood between Sparta and [[Amyclae]], and to have given to those divinities the names of [[Cleta]] and Phaenna. A [[heroon|shrine]] was erected to him in the neighborhood of Therapne.\n\n==Archaeology of the classical period==\n[[File:Ancient sparta theater.jpg|thumb|The theater of ancient Sparta with [[Taygetus|Mt. Taygetus]] in the background.]]\n[[Thucydides]] wrote:<blockquote>Suppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame.  Their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages, like the ancient towns of Hellas, and would therefore make a poor show.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sparta |volume=25 |pages=609\u201314 |inline=1 |first=Marcus Niebuhr |last=Tod}}</ref><ref>Thucydides, i. 10</ref></blockquote>\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the chief ancient buildings at Sparta were the theatre, of which, however, little showed above ground except portions of the [[retaining wall]]s; the so-called ''Tomb of [[Leonidas]]'', a quadrangular building, perhaps a temple, constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers; the foundation of an ancient bridge over the [[Eurotas]]; the ruins of a circular structure; some remains of late Roman fortifications; several brick buildings and mosaic pavements.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions, sculptures, and other objects collected in the local museum, founded by Stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907. Partial excavation of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens|American School at Athens]]. The structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of Hellenic origin that was partly restored during the Roman period.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n[[File:Sparta ruins.PNG|thumb|left|[[Ruins]] from the ancient site]]\n\nIn 1904, the [[British School at Athens]] began a thorough exploration of [[Laconia]], and in the following year excavations were made at [[Thalamae (Laconia)|Thalamae]], Geronthrae, and Angelona near [[Monemvasia]]. In 1906, excavations began in Sparta.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nA small circus described by [[William Martin Leake|Leake]] proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after AD 200 around the altar and in front of the temple of [[Artemis Orthia]]. Here musical and gymnastic contests took place as well as the famous flogging ordeal (''[[Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia#Winged Artemis#Diamastigosis|diamastigosis]]''). The temple, which can be dated to the 2nd century BC, rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century, and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple, dating from the 9th or even the 10th century. The [[votive offering]]s in clay, amber, bronze, ivory and lead found in great profusion within the precinct range, dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC, supply invaluable evidence for early Spartan art.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1907, the sanctuary of Athena \"of the Brazen House\" (\u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, Chalkioikos) was located on the acropolis immediately above the theatre, and though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed, the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription of Laconia, numerous bronze nails and plates, and a considerable number of votive offerings.

The late Roman wall enclosing the acropolis, part of which probably dates from the years following the Gothic raid of AD 262, was also investigated.

Built early 8th century BC it was believed by Spartans to be the home of Menelaus. In 1970 the British School in Athens started excavations in an attempt to locate Mycenaean remains in the area around Menelaion. Among other findings, they uncovered the remains of two Mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to Helen and Menelaus. These mansions were destroyed by earthquake and fire, and archaeologists consider them the possible palace of Menelaus himself.<ref>The British School at Athens, [http://www.bsa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=14&Itemid=101 Home].</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}} Excavations made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia.<ref>''The Mycenaean presence in the southeastern Eurotas valley: Vouno Panagias and Ayios Georgios'', by Emilia Banou.</ref> The Mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north.

At the peak of its power in the early 4th century BC, Sparta had subdued many of the main Greek states and even invaded the Persian provinces in Anatolia (modern day Turkey), a period known as the [[Spartan hegemony|Spartan Hegemony]].\n\nDuring the [[Corinthian War]], Sparta faced a coalition of the leading Greek states: [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Athens]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and [[Argos]].

Modern [[Sparti (municipality)|Sparti]] was re-founded in 1834, by a decree of King [[Otto of Greece]].\n\n==Structure of Classical Spartan society==\n\n===Constitution===\n{{main|Spartan Constitution}}\n[[File:SpartaGreatRhetra.png|thumb|right|200px|Structure of the Spartan Constitution]]\nSparta was an [[oligarchy]]. The state was ruled by two [[Diarchy|hereditary kings]] of the [[List of Kings of Sparta|Agiad and Eurypontid]] [[family|families]],<ref>{{harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=89}}</ref> both supposedly descendants of [[Heracles]] and equal in authority, so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and military. As chief priests of the state, they maintained communication with the Delphian sanctuary, whose pronouncements exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus c. 450 BC, their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses, adoptions and the public roads. [[Aristotle]] describes the kingship at Sparta as \"a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship\" (Pol. iii. 1285a), while [[Isocrates]] refers to the Spartans as \"subject to an [[oligarchy]] at home, to a kingship on campaign\" (iii. 24).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nCivil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the [[ephors]], as well as a council of [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] known as the [[gerousia]].  The gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings.<ref>''The Greeks at War'' By Philip De Souza, Waldemar Heckel, Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, Victor Davis Hanson</ref> High state decisions were discussed by this council, who could then propose policies to the ''damos'', the collective body of Spartan citizenry, who would [[Great Rhetra|select one of the alternatives by vote]].<ref>''The Politics By Aristotle'', Thomas Alan Sinclair, Trevor J. Saunders</ref><ref>''A companion to Greek studies''\n By Leonard Whibley</ref>\n\nRoyal prerogatives were curtailed over time. From the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to [[declaration of war|declare war]] and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted by the ephors also in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Political power was transferred to the ephors and gerousia.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAn assembly of citizens called the [[Apella|a''pella'']]<ref name=EB1911/> was responsible for electing men to the [[gerousia]] for life.\n\n===Citizenship===\nThe Spartan education process known as the ''[[agoge]]'' was essential for full citizenship. However, usually the only boys eligible for the ''agoge'' were [[Spartiates]], those who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city.\n\nThere were two exceptions. ''[[Trophimoi]]'' or \"foster sons\" were foreign students invited to study. The Athenian general [[Xenophon]], for example, sent his two sons to Sparta as trophimoi. Also, the son of a helot could be enrolled as a ''syntrophos''<ref>{{LSJ|su/ntrofos|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2|shortref}}.</ref> if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way; if he did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate.<ref>''The Greek World''\n By Anton Powell</ref> Spartans who could not afford to pay the expenses of the ''agoge'' could lose their citizenship.\n\nThese laws meant that Sparta could not readily replace citizens lost in battle or otherwise, which eventually proved near fatal as citizens became greatly outnumbered by non-citizens, and even more dangerously by helots.\n\n===Non citizens===\nThe other classes were the [[perioeci|perioikoi]], free inhabitants who were non-citizens, and the [[helots]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Ancient Greece'' By [[Sarah B. Pomeroy]], Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Jennifer Tolbert Roberts</ref> state-owned [[serfs]]. Descendants of non-Spartan citizens were forbidden the ''agoge''.\n\n====Helots====\n{{main|Helots}}\nThe Spartans were a minority of the Lakonian population.  The largest class of inhabitants were the helots (in [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f35\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}} / ''He\u00edl\u00f4tes'').<ref>Herodotus (IX, 28\u201329)</ref><ref>Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', III, 3, 5</ref>\n\nThe helots were originally free Greeks from the areas of [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] and [[Lakonia]] whom the Spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaved.  In contrast to populations conquered by other Greek cities (e.g. the Athenian treatment of Melos), the male population was not exterminated and the women and children turned into chattel slaves. Instead, the helots were given a subordinate position in society more comparable to serfs in medieval Europe than chattel slaves in the rest of Greece.\n\nHelots did not have voting or political rights. The Spartan poet [[Tyrtaeus|Tyrtaios]] refers to Helots being allowed to marry and retaining 50% of the fruits of their labor.<ref>{{Harvnb|West|1999|p=24}}</ref>  They also seem to have been allowed to practice religious rites and, according to Thucydides, own a limited amount of personal property.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=141}}</ref>\nInitially Helots couldn't be freed but during the middle [[Hellenistic period]], some 6,000 helots accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom, for example, in 227 BC.\n\nIn other Greek city-states, free citizens were part-time soldiers who, when not at war, carried on other trades.  Since Spartan men were full-time soldiers, they were not available to carry out manual labour.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=140}}</ref>  The helots were used as unskilled [[serf]]s, tilling Spartan land.  Helot women were often used as [[wet nurse]]s.  Helots also travelled with the Spartan army as non-combatant serfs.  At the last stand of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Greek dead included not just the legendary three hundred Spartan soldiers but also several hundred [[Thespiae|Thespian]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] troops and a number of helots.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehrenberg|2004|p=159}}</ref>\n\nRelations between the helots and their Spartan masters were sometimes strained. There was at least one helot revolt (c. 465\u2013460 BC), and Thucydides remarked that \"Spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots.\"<ref>Thucydides (IV, 80); the Greek is ambiguous</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=211}}</ref> On the other hand, the Spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 BC to take a force of 35,000 with them to Plataea, something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away. Slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the Greek world, and in 413 BC 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to join the Spartan forces occupying Attica.<ref>Thucydides (VII, 27)</ref> What made Sparta's relations with her slave population unique was that the helots, precisely because they enjoyed privileges such as family and property, retained their identity as a conquered people (the Messenians) and also had effective kinship groups that could be used to organize rebellion.\n\nAs the Spartiate population declined and the helot population continued to grow, the imbalance of power caused increasing tension. According to Myron of Priene<ref>Talbert, p. 26.</ref> of the middle 3rd century BC:\n\n{{quote|\n\"They assign to the Helots every shameful task leading to disgrace. For they ordained that each one of them must wear a dogskin cap ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u1fc6}} / ''kun\u1ec5'') and wrap himself in skins ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03c6\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1}} / ''diphth\u00e9ra'') and receive a stipulated number of beatings every year regardless of any wrongdoing, so that they would never forget they were slaves. Moreover, if any exceeded the vigour proper to a slave's condition, they made death the penalty; and they allotted a punishment to those controlling them if they failed to rebuke those who were growing fat\".<ref>Apud Athenaeus, 14, 647d = ''FGH'' 106 F 2. Trans. by Cartledge, p. 305.</ref>}}\n\nPlutarch also states that Spartans treated the Helots \"harshly and cruelly\": they compelled them to drink pure wine (which was considered dangerous \u2013 [[Diet of Ancient Greece#Wine|wine]] usually being cut with water) \"...and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs...\" during ''[[syssitia]]'' (obligatory banquets).<ref>''Life of Lycurgus'' 28, 8\u201310.

As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, and no one ever knew how each of them perished.\"<ref>Thucydides (Book IV 80.4).</ref><ref>Classical historian Anton Powell has recorded a similar story from 1980s [[El Salvador]]. Cf.

The ''agoge'' was designed to encourage discipline and physical toughness and to emphasize the importance of the Spartan state. Boys lived in communal [[Mess|messes]] and, according to Xenophon, whose sons attended the ''agoge'', the boys were fed \"just the right amount for them never to become sluggish through being too full, while also giving them a taste of what it is not to have enough.\"<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 2\">Xenophon, Spartan Society, 2</ref> In addition they were trained to survive in times of privation, even if it meant stealing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Western Heritage|last=Kagan|first=Donald|last2=Ozment|first2=Steven|last3=Frank|first3=Turner|last4=Frank|first4=Alison|publisher=Pearson|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=44, Spartan Society|chapter=The Rise of Greek Civilization}}</ref> Besides physical and weapons training, boys studied reading, writing, music and dancing.

However, there is no evidence of this in archaic Sparta. According to some sources, the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Sparta|Spartan pederasty]] is not entirely clear).<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2001|pp=91\u2013105}}</ref> It is notable, however, that the only contemporary source with direct experience of the ''agoge'', Xenophon, explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 2\"/>\n\nPost 465 BC, some Spartan youth apparently became members of an irregular unit known as the ''[[Krypteia]]''. The immediate objective of this unit was to seek out and kill vulnerable helot Laconians as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2001|p=88}}</ref>\n\nLess information is available about the education of Spartan girls, but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle, broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training. In this respect, classical Sparta was unique in ancient Greece.

Men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30.  They called themselves \"''homoioi''\" (equals), pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]], which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades.<ref name=cowley>Readers Companion Military Hist p. 438. Cowley</ref>  Insofar as [[hoplite]] warfare could be perfected, the Spartans did so.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adcock|1957|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThucydides reports that when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or another woman of some significance) would customarily present him with his [[hoplon]] (shield) and say: \"With this, or upon this\" (\u1f2a \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fb6\u03c2, ''\u00c8i t\u00e0n \u00e8i \u00e8p\u00ec t\u00e0s''), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it).<ref>{{Harvnb|Plutarch|2004|p=465}}</ref> Unfortunately, poignant as this image may be, it is almost certainly propaganda.  Spartans buried their battle dead on or near the battle field; corpses were not brought back on their hoplons.<ref name=\"Sons and Mothers\"/> Nevertheless, it is fair to say that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet, breastplate or [[greave]]s than his hoplon, since the former were designed to protect one man, whereas the hoplon also protected the man on his left. Thus the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier's subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms \u2013 messmates and friends, often close blood relations.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the Spartan military culture was actually short-sighted and ineffective. He observed:\n<blockquote>It is the standards of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind, for it is good men not beasts who are capable of real courage. Those like the Spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of city's life, end up making them inferior even in that.<ref>{{Harvnb|Forrest|1968|p=53}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about Sparta that has no basis in fact is the notion that Spartan mothers were without feelings toward their off-spring and helped enforce a militaristic lifestyle on their sons and husbands.<ref>{{cite book| title=Spartan Women| author=Sarah B.

Spartan citizens were required to donate a certain amount of what they yielded from their kleros to their syssitia, or mess.

The so-called 'bridesmaid' took charge of the captured girl.  She first shaved her head to the scalp, then dressed her in a man's cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark.  The bridegroom \u2013 who was not drunk and thus not impotent, but was sober as always \u2013 first had dinner in the messes, then would slip in, undo her belt, lift her and carry her to the bed.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Lycurgus</ref></blockquote>  The husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage.  These customs, unique to the Spartans, have been interpreted in various ways.  One of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage, so unaccustomed were men to women's looks at the time of their first intercourse. The \"abduction\" may have served to ward off the [[evil eye]], and the cutting of the wife's hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=42}}</ref>\n\n==Role of women==\n{{main|Women in ancient Sparta}}\n\n===Political, social, and economic equality===\nSpartan women, of the citizenry class, enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. The higher status of females in Spartan society started at birth; unlike Athens, Spartan girls were fed the same food as their brothers.<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 1\">Xenophon, Spartan Society, 1</ref> Nor were they confined to their father's house and prevented from exercising or getting fresh air as in Athens, but exercised and even competed in sports.<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 1\"/> Most important, rather than being married off at the age of 12 or 13, Spartan law forbade the marriage of a girl until she was in her late teens or early 20s. The reasons for delaying marriage were to ensure the birth of healthy children, but the effect was to spare Spartan women the hazards and lasting health damage associated with [[Teenage pregnancy|pregnancy among adolescents]].  Spartan women, better fed from childhood and fit from exercise, stood a far better chance of reaching old age than their sisters in other Greek cities, where the median age for death was 34.6 years or roughly 10 years below that of men.<ref>Susan Blundell, \"Women in Ancient Greece,\" British Museum Press, London, 1999</ref>\n\nUnlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore dresses (peplos) slit up the side to allow freer movement and moved freely about the city, either walking or driving chariots. Girls as well as boys exercised, possibly in the nude, and young women as well as young men may have participated in the ''[[Gymnopaedia]]'' (\"Festival of Nude Youths\").<ref>Guttentag and Secord, 1983; Finley, 1982; Pomeroy, 1975</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAnother practice that was mentioned by many visitors to Sparta was the practice of \u201cwife-sharing\u201d.  In accordance with the Spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents, many older men allowed younger, more fit men, to impregnate their wives.  Other unmarried or childless men might even request another man's wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer.<ref name=\"Powell248\">{{harvnb|Powell|2001|p=248}}</ref> For this reason many considered Spartan women [[Polygamy|polygamous]] or [[Polyandry|polyandrous]].<ref name=\"Blundell154\">{{harvnb|Blundell|1995|p=154}}</ref>  This practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could.  The Spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss of the men in battle and the intense physical inspection of newborns.<ref name=\"Powell246\">{{harvnb|Powell|2001|p=246}}</ref>\n\nSpartan women were also literate and numerate, a rarity in the ancient world. Furthermore, as a result of their education and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with their fellow (male) citizens, they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public.<ref>Maria Dettenhofer, \"Die Frauen von Sparta,\" Reine M\u00e4nner Sache, Munich, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1994, p. 25.</ref> Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women's curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato goes on to praise Spartan women's ability when it came to philosophical discussion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spartan Women|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=9}}</ref>\n\nMost importantly, Spartan women had economic power because they controlled their own properties, and those of their husbands. It is estimated that in later Classical Sparta, when the male population was in serious decline, women were the sole owners of at least 35% of all land and property in Sparta.<ref>Pomeroy, 1975</ref> The laws regarding a divorce were the same for both men and women. Unlike women in Athens, if a Spartan woman became the heiress of her father because she had no living brothers to inherit (an [[epikleros]]), the woman was not required to divorce her current spouse in order to marry her nearest paternal relative.<ref name=Pomeroy1995>Pomeroy, Sarah B.

In ancient times \"Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians always considered the Spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice.\"<ref>Mueller: ''Dorians'' II, 192</ref> Many Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, would often describe Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money.

[[Adolf Hitler]] praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting \"the number allowed to live\".

The defeat by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BC ended Sparta's prominent role, though it maintained its political independence until the [[Roman Greece|Roman conquest of Greece]] in [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|146 BC]]. It then underwent a long period of decline, especially in the [[Middle Ages]], when many Spartans moved to [[Mystras]]. [[Sparti|Modern Sparta]] is the capital of the Greek region of [[Laconia]] and a center for processing citrus and olives.\n\nSparta was unique in [[ancient Greece]] for its social system and [[constitution]] introduced by the almost mythical figure of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. He configured the entire society in order to maximize military proficiency at all costs, focusing all social institutions on military training and physical development. Its inhabitants were classified as [[Spartiate]]s (Spartan citizens with full rights), [[Mothax|mothakes]] (non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans), [[Perioeci|perioikoi]] (free residents engaged in commerce), and [[helots]] (state-owned serfs, enslaved non-Spartan local population). Spartiates underwent the rigorous ''[[agoge]]'' training and education regimen, and Spartan [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] brigades were widely considered to be among the best in battle. Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality with men than elsewhere in [[classical antiquity]].\n\nSparta was the subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in [[Western culture]] following the revival of classical learning. The admiration of Sparta is known as [[laconophilia|Laconism or Laconophilia]]. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote:<blockquote>Sparta had a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality, and through the myth.... The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato's political theory, and that of countless subsequent writers.... [The] ideals that it favors had a great part in framing the doctrines of Rousseau, Nietzsche, and National Socialism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of western philosophy|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=|isbn=978-1138127043|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter XII: The Influence of Sparta|oclc=931802632|date = 2015-08-27}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Names==\nThe earliest attested term referring to Lacedaemon is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc28\ud800\udc10\ud800\udc05\ud800\udc16\ud800\udc1b\ud800\udc0d}}, ''ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo'', \"Lacedaimonian\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script,<ref name=Palaeolexicon-rakedaminijo>{{cite web|website=Palaeolexicon.

The ancients sometimes used a back-formation, referring to the land of Lacedaemon as ''Lacedaemonian country''.

Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.\n\n\"Lacedaemonia\" was not in general use during the classical period and before. It does occur in Greek as an equivalent of Laconia and Messenia during the Roman and early Byzantine periods, mostly in ethnographers and lexica glossing place names.

Ancient Sparta was built on the banks of the [[Eurotas River]], the main river of Laconia, which provided it with a source of fresh water.  The valley of the Eurotas is a natural fortress, bounded to the west by [[Taygetus|Mt. Taygetus]] (2,407 m) and to the east by [[Parnon|Mt. Parnon]] (1,935 m).  To the north, Laconia is separated from [[Arcadia]] by hilly uplands reaching 1000 m in altitude.  These natural defenses worked to Sparta's advantage and contributed to Sparta never having been sacked.  Though landlocked, Sparta had a harbor, [[Gytheio]], on the Laconian Gulf.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[Lacedaemon (mythology)|Lacedaemon]] (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd}}) was a [[Greek mythology|mythical]] king of Laconia.<ref name=PausaniasIII.1.2>{{harvnb|Pausanias|1918|loc= Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D2 \u0399\u0399\u0399.1.2]}}.</ref> The son of [[Zeus]] by the nymph [[Taygete]],  he married [[Sparta (mythology)|Sparta]], the daughter of [[Eurotas (mythology)|Eurotas]], by whom he became the father of [[King Amyclas of Sparta|Amyclas]], [[Eurydice of Argos|Eurydice]], and Asine.  He named the country after himself and the city after his wife.<ref name=PausaniasIII.1.2/> He was believed to have built the sanctuary of the [[Charites]], which stood between Sparta and [[Amyclae]], and to have given to those divinities the names of [[Cleta]] and Phaenna. A [[heroon|shrine]] was erected to him in the neighborhood of Therapne.\n\n==Archaeology of the classical period==\n[[File:Ancient sparta theater.jpg|thumb|The theater of ancient Sparta with [[Taygetus|Mt. Taygetus]] in the background.]]\n[[Thucydides]] wrote:<blockquote>Suppose the city of Sparta to be deserted, and nothing left but the temples and the ground-plan, distant ages would be very unwilling to believe that the power of the Lacedaemonians was at all equal to their fame.  Their city is not built continuously, and has no splendid temples or other edifices; it rather resembles a group of villages, like the ancient towns of Hellas, and would therefore make a poor show.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sparta |volume=25 |pages=609\u201314 |inline=1 |first=Marcus Niebuhr |last=Tod}}</ref><ref>Thucydides, i. 10</ref></blockquote>\n\nUntil the early 20th century, the chief ancient buildings at Sparta were the theatre, of which, however, little showed above ground except portions of the [[retaining wall]]s; the so-called ''Tomb of [[Leonidas]]'', a quadrangular building, perhaps a temple, constructed of immense blocks of stone and containing two chambers; the foundation of an ancient bridge over the [[Eurotas]]; the ruins of a circular structure; some remains of late Roman fortifications; several brick buildings and mosaic pavements.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe remaining archaeological wealth consisted of inscriptions, sculptures, and other objects collected in the local museum, founded by Stamatakis in 1872 and enlarged in 1907. Partial excavation of the round building was undertaken in 1892 and 1893 by the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens|American School at Athens]]. The structure has been since found to be a semicircular retaining wall of Hellenic origin that was partly restored during the Roman period.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n[[File:Sparta ruins.PNG|thumb|left|[[Ruins]] from the ancient site]]\n\nIn 1904, the [[British School at Athens]] began a thorough exploration of [[Laconia]], and in the following year excavations were made at [[Thalamae (Laconia)|Thalamae]], Geronthrae, and Angelona near [[Monemvasia]]. In 1906, excavations began in Sparta.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nA small circus described by [[William Martin Leake|Leake]] proved to be a theatre-like building constructed soon after AD 200 around the altar and in front of the temple of [[Artemis Orthia]]. Here musical and gymnastic contests took place as well as the famous flogging ordeal (''[[Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia#Winged Artemis#Diamastigosis|diamastigosis]]''). The temple, which can be dated to the 2nd century BC, rests on the foundation of an older temple of the 6th century, and close beside it were found the remains of a yet earlier temple, dating from the 9th or even the 10th century. The [[votive offering]]s in clay, amber, bronze, ivory and lead found in great profusion within the precinct range, dating from the 9th to the 4th centuries BC, supply invaluable evidence for early Spartan art.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1907, the sanctuary of Athena \"of the Brazen House\" (''Chalkioikos'') was located on the acropolis immediately above the theatre, and though the actual temple is almost completely destroyed, the site has produced the longest extant archaic inscription of Laconia, numerous bronze nails and plates, and a considerable number of votive offerings. The Greek [[city-wall]], built in successive stages from the 4th to the 2nd century, was traced for a great part of its circuit, which measured 48 stades or nearly {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=in}} (Polyb. 1X. 21). The late Roman wall enclosing the acropolis, part of which probably dates from the years following the Gothic raid of AD 262, was also investigated. Besides the actual buildings discovered, a number of points were situated and mapped in a general study of Spartan topography, based upon the description of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Menelaion===\n{{main|Menelaion, Sparta}}\nThe Menelaion is a shrine associated with Menelaus, located east of Sparta, by the river Eurotas, on the hill ''Profitis Ilias'' ([[Geographic coordinate system|Coordinates]]: {{coord|37.0659|N|22.4536|E|type:landmark_region:GR_scale:500|display=inline}}). Built early 8th century BC it was believed by Spartans to be the home of Menelaus. In 1970 the British School in Athens started excavations in an attempt to locate Mycenaean remains in the area around Menelaion. Among other findings, they uncovered the remains of two Mycenaean mansions and found the first offerings dedicated to Helen and Menelaus. These mansions were destroyed by earthquake and fire, and archaeologists consider them the possible palace of Menelaus himself.<ref>The British School at Athens, [http://www.bsa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=14&Itemid=101 Home].</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}} Excavations made from the early 1990s to the present suggest that the area around Menelaion in the southern part of the Eurotas valley seems to have been the center of Mycenaean Laconia.<ref>''The Mycenaean presence in the southeastern Eurotas valley: Vouno Panagias and Ayios Georgios'', by Emilia Banou.</ref> The Mycenaean settlement was roughly triangular in shape, with its apex pointed towards the north.

It treats the mythic heroes such as the [[Heraclids]] and the [[Perseides|Perseids]], offering a view of the occupation of the Peloponnesus that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements.

[[Doric Greek|Doric]]-speaking populations survive today in [[Tsakonia]]. In the Middle Ages, the political and cultural center of Laconia shifted to the nearby settlement of [[Mystras]], and Sparta fell further in even local importance.  Modern [[Sparti (municipality)|Sparti]] was re-founded in 1834, by a decree of King [[Otto of Greece]].\n\n==Structure of Classical Spartan society==\n\n===Constitution===\n{{main|Spartan Constitution}}\n[[File:SpartaGreatRhetra.png|thumb|right|200px|Structure of the Spartan Constitution]]\nSparta was an [[oligarchy]]. The state was ruled by two [[Diarchy|hereditary kings]] of the [[List of Kings of Sparta|Agiad and Eurypontid]] [[family|families]],<ref>{{harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=89}}</ref> both supposedly descendants of [[Heracles]] and equal in authority, so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and military. As chief priests of the state, they maintained communication with the Delphian sanctuary, whose pronouncements exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus c. 450 BC, their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses, adoptions and the public roads. [[Aristotle]] describes the kingship at Sparta as \"a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship\" (Pol. iii. 1285a), while [[Isocrates]] refers to the Spartans as \"subject to an [[oligarchy]] at home, to a kingship on campaign\" (iii. 24).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nCivil and criminal cases were decided by a group of officials known as the [[ephors]], as well as a council of [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] known as the [[gerousia]].  The gerousia consisted of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings.<ref>''The Greeks at War'' By Philip De Souza, Waldemar Heckel, Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, Victor Davis Hanson</ref> High state decisions were discussed by this council, who could then propose policies to the ''damos'', the collective body of Spartan citizenry, who would [[Great Rhetra|select one of the alternatives by vote]].<ref>''The Politics By Aristotle'', Thomas Alan Sinclair, Trevor J. Saunders</ref><ref>''A companion to Greek studies''\n By Leonard Whibley</ref>\n\nRoyal prerogatives were curtailed over time. From the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to [[declaration of war|declare war]] and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted by the ephors also in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Political power was transferred to the ephors and gerousia.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAn assembly of citizens called the [[Apella|a''pella'']]<ref name=EB1911/> was responsible for electing men to the [[gerousia]] for life.\n\n===Citizenship===\nThe Spartan education process known as the ''[[agoge]]'' was essential for full citizenship. However, usually the only boys eligible for the ''agoge'' were [[Spartiates]], those who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city.\n\nThere were two exceptions. ''[[Trophimoi]]'' or \"foster sons\" were foreign students invited to study. The Athenian general [[Xenophon]], for example, sent his two sons to Sparta as trophimoi. Also, the son of a helot could be enrolled as a ''syntrophos''<ref>{{LSJ|su/ntrofos|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2|shortref}}.</ref> if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way; if he did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate.<ref>''The Greek World''\n By Anton Powell</ref> Spartans who could not afford to pay the expenses of the ''agoge'' could lose their citizenship.\n\nThese laws meant that Sparta could not readily replace citizens lost in battle or otherwise, which eventually proved near fatal as citizens became greatly outnumbered by non-citizens, and even more dangerously by helots.\n\n===Non citizens===\nThe other classes were the [[perioeci|perioikoi]], free inhabitants who were non-citizens, and the [[helots]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Ancient Greece'' By [[Sarah B. Pomeroy]], Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Jennifer Tolbert Roberts</ref> state-owned [[serfs]]. Descendants of non-Spartan citizens were forbidden the ''agoge''.\n\n====Helots====\n{{main|Helots}}\nThe Spartans were a minority of the Lakonian population.  The largest class of inhabitants were the helots (in [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f35\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2}} / ''He\u00edl\u00f4tes'').<ref>Herodotus (IX, 28\u201329)</ref><ref>Xenophon, ''Hellenica'', III, 3, 5</ref>\n\nThe helots were originally free Greeks from the areas of [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] and [[Lakonia]] whom the Spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaved.  In contrast to populations conquered by other Greek cities (e.g. the Athenian treatment of Melos), the male population was not exterminated and the women and children turned into chattel slaves. Instead, the helots were given a subordinate position in society more comparable to serfs in medieval Europe than chattel slaves in the rest of Greece.\n\nHelots did not have voting or political rights. The Spartan poet [[Tyrtaeus|Tyrtaios]] refers to Helots being allowed to marry and retaining 50% of the fruits of their labor.<ref>{{Harvnb|West|1999|p=24}}</ref>  They also seem to have been allowed to practice religious rites and, according to Thucydides, own a limited amount of personal property.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=141}}</ref>\nInitially Helots couldn't be freed but during the middle [[Hellenistic period]], some 6,000 helots accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom, for example, in 227 BC.\n\nIn other Greek city-states, free citizens were part-time soldiers who, when not at war, carried on other trades.  Since Spartan men were full-time soldiers, they were not available to carry out manual labour.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=140}}</ref>  The helots were used as unskilled [[serf]]s, tilling Spartan land.  Helot women were often used as [[wet nurse]]s.  Helots also travelled with the Spartan army as non-combatant serfs.  At the last stand of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Greek dead included not just the legendary three hundred Spartan soldiers but also several hundred [[Thespiae|Thespian]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] troops and a number of helots.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehrenberg|2004|p=159}}</ref>\n\nRelations between the helots and their Spartan masters were sometimes strained. There was at least one helot revolt (c. 465\u2013460 BC), and Thucydides remarked that \"Spartan policy is always mainly governed by the necessity of taking precautions against the helots.\"<ref>Thucydides (IV, 80); the Greek is ambiguous</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|p=211}}</ref> On the other hand, the Spartans trusted their helots enough in 479 BC to take a force of 35,000 with them to Plataea, something they could not have risked if they feared the helots would attack them or run away. Slave revolts occurred elsewhere in the Greek world, and in 413 BC 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to join the Spartan forces occupying Attica.<ref>Thucydides (VII, 27)</ref> What made Sparta's relations with her slave population unique was that the helots, precisely because they enjoyed privileges such as family and property, retained their identity as a conquered people (the Messenians) and also had effective kinship groups that could be used to organize rebellion.\n\nAs the Spartiate population declined and the helot population continued to grow, the imbalance of power caused increasing tension. According to Myron of Priene<ref>Talbert, p. 26.</ref> of the middle 3rd century BC:\n\n{{quote|\n\"They assign to the Helots every shameful task leading to disgrace. For they ordained that each one of them must wear a dogskin cap ({{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u1fc6}} / ''kun\u1ec5'') and wrap himself in skins ({{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03c6\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1}} / ''diphth\u00e9ra'') and receive a stipulated number of beatings every year regardless of any wrongdoing, so that they would never forget they were slaves. Moreover, if any exceeded the vigour proper to a slave's condition, they made death the penalty; and they allotted a punishment to those controlling them if they failed to rebuke those who were growing fat\".<ref>Apud Athenaeus, 14, 647d = ''FGH'' 106 F 2. Trans. by Cartledge, p. 305.</ref>}}\n\nPlutarch also states that Spartans treated the Helots \"harshly and cruelly\": they compelled them to drink pure wine (which was considered dangerous \u2013 [[Diet of Ancient Greece#Wine|wine]] usually being cut with water) \"...and to lead them in that condition into their public halls, that the children might see what a sight a drunken man is; they made them to dance low dances, and sing ridiculous songs...\" during ''[[syssitia]]'' (obligatory banquets).<ref>''Life of Lycurgus'' 28, 8\u201310. See also, ''Life of Demetrios'', 1, 5; ''Constitution of the Lacedemonians'' 30; ''De Cohibenda Ira'' 6; ''De Commmunibus Notitiis'' 19.</ref>\n\nEach year when the Ephors took office, they ritually declared war on the helots, allowing Spartans to kill them without risk of ritual pollution.<ref>(Plutarch, ''Life of Lycurgus'' 28, 7)</ref> This fight seems to have been carried out by ''kryptai'' (sing. \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ''krypt\u0113s''), graduates of the ''agoge'' who took part in the mysterious institution known as the ''[[Crypteia|Krypteia]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Powell|2001|p=254}}</ref> Thucydides states:\n<blockquote>\n\"The helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves against the enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the object being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim their freedom would be the most high spirited and the most apt to rebel. As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, and no one ever knew how each of them perished.\"<ref>Thucydides (Book IV 80.4).</ref><ref>Classical historian Anton Powell has recorded a similar story from 1980s [[El Salvador]].

Although they did not enjoy full citizen-rights, they were free and not subjected to the same restrictions as the helots.  The exact nature of their subjection to the Spartans is not clear, but they seem to have served partly as a kind of military reserve, partly as skilled craftsmen and partly as agents of foreign trade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|pp=153\u201355}}</ref>  Perioikoic hoplites served increasingly with the Spartan army, explicitly at the [[Battle of Plataea]], and although they may also have fulfilled functions such as the manufacture and repair of armour and weapons,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2002|pp=158, 178}}</ref> they were increasingly integrated into the combat units of the Spartan army as the Spartiate population declined.<ref>\"Population Patterns in Late Archaic and Classical Sparta\" by Thomas Figueira, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 116 (1986), pp. 165\u2013213</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Rider BM B1.jpg|thumb|[[Name vase]] of the Spartan artist known as the [[Rider Painter]] ([[black-figure]]d [[kylix (cup)|kylix]], c. 550\u2013530 BC)]]\nFull citizen Spartiates were barred by law from trade or manufacture, which consequently rested in the hands of the Perioikoi.<ref name=EB1911/> This lucrative monopoly, in a fertile territory with a good harbors, ensured the loyalty of the perioikoi.<ref>Paul Cartledge, ''Sparta and Lakonia'', Routledge, London, 1979, pp. 154\u201359</ref> Despite the prohibition on menial labor or trade, there is evidence of Spartan sculptors,<ref>Conrad Stibbe, ''Das Andere Sparta'', Verlag Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, 1996, pp. 111\u201327</ref> and Spartans were certainly poets, magistrates, ambassadors, and governors as well as soldiers.\n\nAllegedly, Spartans were prohibited from possessing gold and silver coins, and according to legend Spartan currency consisted of iron bars to discourage hoarding.<ref>Excel HSC ''Ancient History'' By Peter Roberts, {{ISBN|1-74125-178-8|978-1-74125-178-4}}</ref><ref name=\"48LawsPower420\">{{Citation|last=Greene|first=Robert|title=The 48 Laws of Power|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=2000|page=420|isbn=0-14-028019-7|title-link=The 48 Laws of Power}}</ref> It was not until the 260s or 250s BC that Sparta began to mint its own coins.<ref>{{citation|last=Hodkinson|first=Stephen|title=Property and Wealth in Classical Sparta|year=2000|p=154}}</ref> Though the conspicuous display of wealth appears to have been discouraged, this did not preclude the production of very fine decorated bronze, ivory and wooden works of art as well as exquisite jewellery, attested in archaeology.<ref>Conrad Stibbe, ''Das Andere Sparta'', Verlag Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, 1996</ref>\n\nAllegedly as part of the Lycurgan Reforms in the mid-8th century BC, a massive land reform had divided property into 9,000 equal portions.

The Gerousia then decided whether it was to be reared or not.<ref name=EB1911/> It is commonly stated that if they considered it \"puny and deformed\", the baby was thrown into a chasm on [[Taygetus|Mount Taygetos]] known euphemistically as the ''Apothetae'' (Gr., ''\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9'', \"Deposits\").<ref name=\"Cartledge 2001 84\">{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2001|p=84}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Plutarch|2005|p=20}}</ref>  This was, in effect, a primitive form of [[eugenics]].<ref name=\"Cartledge 2001 84\"/> Sparta is often viewed as being unique in this regard, however, anthropologist Laila Williamson notes that \"Infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations.

According to some sources, the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Sparta|Spartan pederasty]] is not entirely clear).<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2001|pp=91\u2013105}}</ref> It is notable, however, that the only contemporary source with direct experience of the ''agoge'', Xenophon, explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 2\"/>\n\nPost 465 BC, some Spartan youth apparently became members of an irregular unit known as the ''[[Krypteia]]''. The immediate objective of this unit was to seek out and kill vulnerable helot Laconians as part of the larger program of terrorising and intimidating the helot population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartledge|2001|p=88}}</ref>\n\nLess information is available about the education of Spartan girls, but they seem to have gone through a fairly extensive formal educational cycle, broadly similar to that of the boys but with less emphasis on military training. In this respect, classical Sparta was unique in ancient Greece.

Men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30.  They called themselves \"''homoioi''\" (equals), pointing to their common lifestyle and the discipline of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]], which demanded that no soldier be superior to his comrades.<ref name=cowley>Readers Companion Military Hist p. 438. Cowley</ref>  Insofar as [[hoplite]] warfare could be perfected, the Spartans did so.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adcock|1957|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThucydides reports that when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or another woman of some significance) would customarily present him with his [[hoplon]] (shield) and say: \"With this, or upon this\" (\u1f2a \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u1f22 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fb6\u03c2, ''\u00c8i t\u00e0n \u00e8i \u00e8p\u00ec t\u00e0s''), meaning that true Spartans could only return to Sparta either victorious (with their shield in hand) or dead (carried upon it).<ref>{{Harvnb|Plutarch|2004|p=465}}</ref> Unfortunately, poignant as this image may be, it is almost certainly propaganda.  Spartans buried their battle dead on or near the battle field; corpses were not brought back on their hoplons.<ref name=\"Sons and Mothers\"/> Nevertheless, it is fair to say that it was less of a disgrace for a soldier to lose his helmet, breastplate or [[greave]]s than his hoplon, since the former were designed to protect one man, whereas the hoplon also protected the man on his left. Thus the shield was symbolic of the individual soldier's subordination to his unit, his integral part in its success, and his solemn responsibility to his comrades in arms \u2013 messmates and friends, often close blood relations.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the Spartan military culture was actually short-sighted and ineffective. He observed:\n<blockquote>It is the standards of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind, for it is good men not beasts who are capable of real courage. Those like the Spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of city's life, end up making them inferior even in that.<ref>{{Harvnb|Forrest|1968|p=53}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne of the most persistent myths about Sparta that has no basis in fact is the notion that Spartan mothers were without feelings toward their off-spring and helped enforce a militaristic lifestyle on their sons and husbands.<ref>{{cite book| title=Spartan Women| author=Sarah B.

These items were grown locally on each Spartan citizens kleros and were tended to by helots. Spartan citizens were required to donate a certain amount of what they yielded from their kleros to their syssitia, or mess. These donations to the syssitia were a requirement for every Spartan citizen.

The so-called 'bridesmaid' took charge of the captured girl.  She first shaved her head to the scalp, then dressed her in a man's cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark.  The bridegroom \u2013 who was not drunk and thus not impotent, but was sober as always \u2013 first had dinner in the messes, then would slip in, undo her belt, lift her and carry her to the bed.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Lycurgus</ref></blockquote>  The husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage.  These customs, unique to the Spartans, have been interpreted in various ways.  One of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage, so unaccustomed were men to women's looks at the time of their first intercourse. The \"abduction\" may have served to ward off the [[evil eye]], and the cutting of the wife's hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=42}}</ref>\n\n==Role of women==\n{{main|Women in ancient Sparta}}\n\n===Political, social, and economic equality===\nSpartan women, of the citizenry class, enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. The higher status of females in Spartan society started at birth; unlike Athens, Spartan girls were fed the same food as their brothers.<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 1\">Xenophon, Spartan Society, 1</ref> Nor were they confined to their father's house and prevented from exercising or getting fresh air as in Athens, but exercised and even competed in sports.<ref name=\"Xenophon, Spartan Society, 1\"/> Most important, rather than being married off at the age of 12 or 13, Spartan law forbade the marriage of a girl until she was in her late teens or early 20s. The reasons for delaying marriage were to ensure the birth of healthy children, but the effect was to spare Spartan women the hazards and lasting health damage associated with [[Teenage pregnancy|pregnancy among adolescents]].  Spartan women, better fed from childhood and fit from exercise, stood a far better chance of reaching old age than their sisters in other Greek cities, where the median age for death was 34.6 years or roughly 10 years below that of men.<ref>Susan Blundell, \"Women in Ancient Greece,\" British Museum Press, London, 1999</ref>\n\nUnlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore dresses (peplos) slit up the side to allow freer movement and moved freely about the city, either walking or driving chariots. Girls as well as boys exercised, possibly in the nude, and young women as well as young men may have participated in the ''[[Gymnopaedia]]'' (\"Festival of Nude Youths\").<ref>Guttentag and Secord, 1983; Finley, 1982; Pomeroy, 1975</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Pomeroy|2002|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAnother practice that was mentioned by many visitors to Sparta was the practice of \u201cwife-sharing\u201d.  In accordance with the Spartan belief that breeding should be between the most physically fit parents, many older men allowed younger, more fit men, to impregnate their wives.  Other unmarried or childless men might even request another man's wife to bear his children if she had previously been a strong child bearer.<ref name=\"Powell248\">{{harvnb|Powell|2001|p=248}}</ref> For this reason many considered Spartan women [[Polygamy|polygamous]] or [[Polyandry|polyandrous]].<ref name=\"Blundell154\">{{harvnb|Blundell|1995|p=154}}</ref>  This practice was encouraged in order that women bear as many strong-bodied children as they could.  The Spartan population was hard to maintain due to the constant absence and loss of the men in battle and the intense physical inspection of newborns.<ref name=\"Powell246\">{{harvnb|Powell|2001|p=246}}</ref>\n\nSpartan women were also literate and numerate, a rarity in the ancient world. Furthermore, as a result of their education and the fact that they moved freely in society engaging with their fellow (male) citizens, they were notorious for speaking their minds even in public.<ref>Maria Dettenhofer, \"Die Frauen von Sparta,\" Reine M\u00e4nner Sache, Munich, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag, 1994, p. 25.</ref> Plato, in the middle of the fourth century, described women's curriculum in Sparta as consisting of gymnastics and mousike (music and arts). Plato goes on to praise Spartan women's ability when it came to philosophical discussion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spartan Women|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=9}}</ref>\n\nMost importantly, Spartan women had economic power because they controlled their own properties, and those of their husbands. It is estimated that in later Classical Sparta, when the male population was in serious decline, women were the sole owners of at least 35% of all land and property in Sparta.<ref>Pomeroy, 1975</ref> The laws regarding a divorce were the same for both men and women. Unlike women in Athens, if a Spartan woman became the heiress of her father because she had no living brothers to inherit (an [[epikleros]]), the woman was not required to divorce her current spouse in order to marry her nearest paternal relative.<ref name=Pomeroy1995>Pomeroy, Sarah B.

Sparta was subject of considerable admiration in its day, even in rival [[Ancient Athens|Athens]].  In ancient times \"Many of the noblest and best of the Athenians always considered the Spartan state nearly as an ideal theory realised in practice.\"<ref>Mueller: ''Dorians'' II, 192</ref> Many Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, would often describe Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money. The French classicist Fran\u00e7ois Ollier in his 1933 book ''Le mirage spartiate'' (The Spartan Mirage) warned that a major scholarly problem is that all surviving accounts of Sparta were by non-Spartans who often excessively idealized their subject.<ref name=\"Hodkinson pages 222-281\">Hodkinson, Stephen \"The Imaginary Spartan ''Politeria''\" pp. 22\u201381 from ''The Imaginary Polis: Symposium, January 7\u201310, 2004'' edited by Mogens Herman Hansen, Copenhagen: Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, 2005 p. 222.</ref>\n\n[[File:Young Spartans National Gallery NG3860.jpg|thumb|''[[Young Spartans Exercising]]'' by [[Edgar Degas]] (1834\u20131917)]]\n\nWith the revival of classical learning in [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], Laconophilia re-appeared, for example in the writings of [[Machiavelli]]. The Elizabethan English constitutionalist [[John Aylmer (English constitutionalist)|John Aylmer]] compared the mixed government of Tudor England to the Spartan republic, stating that \"Lacedemonia [was] the noblest and best city governed that ever was\". He commended it as a model for England.

In the 20th century, this developed into [[Fascism|Fascist]] admiration of Spartan ideals. [[Adolf Hitler]] praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting \"the number allowed to live\". He added that \"The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans.\" The Spartans had created \"the first racialist state\".<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/holocaustremembrance/docs/paper3.shtml |title=Professor Ben Kiernan, ''Hitler, Pol Pot, and Hutu Power: Distinguishing Themes of Genocidal Ideology'', Holocaust and the United Nations Discussion Paper |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nCertain early Zionists, and particularly the founders of [[Kibbutz]] movement in Israel, were influenced by Spartan ideals, particularly in education.

It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.   Combined, these volunteer activities will be the largest volunteer event in history. <ref>[https://www.earthday.org/campaigns/greatglobalcleanup/ Great Global CleanUp]</ref><ref>[https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020 Earth Day 50th Anniversary]</ref><ref>[https://real-leaders.com/earth-day-take-part-in-the-biggest-volunteer-event-in-history/ Earth Day: Take Part in the Biggest Volunteer Event in History]</ref>\n* Education: Earth Day is building environmental and climate literacy worldwide.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

In May 2011, she reached her best singles ranking of world No. 25. In August 2012, she peaked at No. 31 in the doubles rankings.

In the 2003 [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] junior competition she lost in semifinal to the eventual winner [[Kirsten Flipkens]]. In the [[Australian Open]] junior competition, 2004, she reached semifinals in both singles and doubles (with [[Shahar Pe'er]]). Both times she lost to [[Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1]]. Another success came in winning doubles at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] junior tournament in 2003 with [[Andrea Hlav\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1]].<ref>http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100000309</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===2001\u20132003===\nWolfe began competing as Jarmila Gajdo\u0161ov\u00e1 on the [[ITF Women's Circuit|ITF Circuit]] just days after her 14th birthday in 2001, and that year entered three [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tournaments, winning two matches and losing three. In 2002, she again entered only three tournaments, but this time won four matches and lost three.\n\nEarly in 2003, still aged 15, she stepped up her schedule, and that February she reached the semifinal of a $25k tournament at Redbridge, defeating [[S\u00e9verine Beltrame]], [[Sandra Kl\u00f6sel]], and [[Roberta Vinci]] before losing to [[Olga Barabanschikova]]. She won the next tournament she entered, her third of the year and only the ninth of her career. It was the $10k event at Rabat in March; and in the semifinal she defeated [[Ekaterina Bychkova]]. On the strength of this result, she found herself wildcarded into qualifying for her first WTA Tour event, a clay-court tournament at Budapest in April, and justified the wildcard by defeating all three of her opponents in the qualifying draw, including [[Melinda Czink]], in straight sets, then [[Virginie Razzano]] in the second round of the main draw, before losing 4\u20136, 3\u20136 to [[Alicia Molik]].\n\nOn her 16th birthday she entered qualifying for a $50k event on grass at Gifu, Japan. Again, she qualified defeating [[Aiko Nakamura]] in the qualifying round; and she reached the second round of the main draw before losing to another top Japanese player, [[Akiko Morigami]]. The next week, she came through three straight matches in qualifying at her third successive event, another Japanese $50k grass-court tournament at Fukuoka, defeating [[Sanda Mami\u0107]] of Croatia in the qualifying round, before advancing to the quarterfinal of the main draw after a second-round victory over [[Zheng Jie]], only to lose to [[Saori Obata]].\n\nAt the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in August, she reached the final round of qualifying with upset of [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]], but ultimately lost to [[Anik\u00f3 Kapros]] of Hungary. Her season ended with two more losses in the later stages of qualifying draws at WTA events to higher ranked players. The 16-year-old Slovak ended the year ranked No. 197.<ref>http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9530/title/jarmila-gajdosova</ref>\n\n===2004\u20132005===\nIn 2004, she suffered six successive losses between August and October. Earlier in the season she scored wins over [[Lilia Osterloh]] and [[Tzipora Obziler]] in qualifying for Memphis, [[Akiko Morigami]] and [[Tiffany Dabek]] at Fukuoka, [[Zuzana Ondr\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1]] in Wimbledon qualifying, and [[Elena Baltacha]] in a $50k event at Lexington, while her performance in reaching the final of the $50k event at Fukuoka was her career-best in a tournament of its class. Her year-end ranking was world No. 217.\n\nIn February 2005, she qualified for the annual WTA Tour event at Hyderabad, and beat [[Li Ting (tennis, born 1980)|Li Ting]] in the first round of the main draw before losing to [[Anna-Lena Gr\u00f6nefeld]] of Germany. She did not play in March or April, but returned in May to win her first $25k event and her second career tournament on the clay of Catania, Italy beating [[Ivana Abramovi\u0107]] of Croatia in the final. The following week, she reached the quarterfinal of another $50k event at Saint-Gaudens, France beating Argentine [[Mar\u00eda Emilia Salerni]] and French player [[Pauline Parmentier]] to this end. She entered qualifying at the [[French Open]], and defeated [[Shikha Uberoi]] but lost to [[Sofia Arvidsson]] in the second leg.\n\nOver May and June, the 18-year-old suffered two consecutive losses in $25k tournaments to Chinese player [[Yuan Meng]]. She was able to win her second $25k tournament of the year and third career title on the grass courts of Felixstowe in July, beating [[Katie O'Brien]] of Great Britain in the semifinal and [[Alla Kudryavtseva]] in the final. The following week, she reached the semifinals of the $50k event at Vittel, France with wins over German [[Jana Kandarr]] and her countrywoman [[Sandra Kl\u00f6sel]].\n\nFor the second successive summer, she experienced several consecutive early defeats. But in late September she defeated [[Alona Bondarenko]], [[Kateryna Bondarenko]], and [[Mar\u00eda Emilia Salerni]] to qualify for the WTA event at Luxembourg, in the first round of which she defeated [[Katarina Srebotnik]] in two close sets before losing to [[Dinara Safina]]. She had improved her year-end ranking to No. 147.<ref>http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9530/title/jarmila-gajdosova</ref>\n\n===2006: Top 100 breakthrough and first WTA doubles titles===\nThe 18-year-old Gajdo\u0161ov\u00e1 came through the qualifying draw to gain entry to her first Grand Slam main draw at the [[Australian Open]]. She then lost a close three set first-round match to [[Martina M\u00fcller (tennis)|Martina M\u00fcller]] of Germany. But the ranking points accrued were sufficient to lift her to world No. 117 on 6 February 2006.\n\nStaying in Australia for the rest of the month, she retreated temporarily to the ITF Circuit, winning two $25k tournaments in consecutive weeks, at Gosford and Sydney, the fourth and fifth ITF singles titles of her career. These two minor tournament victories resulted in her ranking rising to No. 106.\n\nIn mid-March, she followed up these two tournament victories by entering another $25k event at Canberra, and again came through as the victor, defeating world No. 178, [[Hanna Nooni]], in the semifinals and Australian [[Monique Adamczak]] in the final.\n\nThe next week, she extended her winning streak to seventeen matches in reaching the quarterfinals of a $25k event in Melbourne, but then lost to Australian world No. 260 [[Sophie Ferguson]], 1\u20136, 4\u20136.

She won her first WTA Tour title in 2006, emerging as the [[Nordea Nordic Light Open]] doubles champion, her first singles title came in 2010 at the [[2010 Guangzhou International Women's Open|Guangzhou International Open]], and the following year she won the [[2011 Moorilla Hobart International|Hobart International]]. In May 2011, she reached her best singles ranking of world No. 25. In August 2012, she peaked at No. 31 in the doubles rankings. Her greatest achievement came at the 2013 Australian Open, where she won the [[2013 Australian Open \u2013 Mixed Doubles|mixed-doubles]] title with countryman [[Matthew Ebden]].\n\n==Personal life==\nWolfe's father J\u00e1n Gajdo\u0161 is an engineer, as was her mother who died in September 2012; her older brother J\u00e1n Gajdo\u0161 Jr. was a professional skier. She married Australian tennis player [[Sam Groth]] in February 2009 and competed as '''Jarmila Groth''' from 2009 to 2011. When the couple divorced in 2011, Wolfe reverted to her birth name.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/sport/adopted-australian-tennis-star-hurt-by-online-abuse-20110903-1jr0g.html ''Adopted Australian tennis star hurt by online abuse''], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 3 September 2011.</ref> Following her marriage on 1 November 2015 to Adam Wolfe, from January 2016 on she was competing as '''Jarmila Wolfe'''.<ref>http://www.womenstennisblog.com/2015/08/31/jarmila-gajdosova-soon-to-be-mrs-wolfe-gives-marriage-a-second-chance/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hopmancup.com/countries/australia-gold/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104021352/http://hopmancup.com/countries/australia-gold |archivedate=4 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In November 2017, Wolfe gave birth to their first child, Natalia Jarmila Wolfe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/wolfe-joins-2017-mom-club-after-arrival-cub|title=Wolfe joins 2017 mom club after arrival of cub|last=Dunn|first=Carrie|date=2017-11-15|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Junior career==\nAlthough she had already been playing in senior events for some years by the time, the highlights of her junior career came as she reached the semifinals at two junior [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. In the 2003 [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] junior competition she lost in semifinal to the eventual winner [[Kirsten Flipkens]]. In the [[Australian Open]] junior competition, 2004, she reached semifinals in both singles and doubles (with [[Shahar Pe'er]]). Both times she lost to [[Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1]]. Another success came in winning doubles at the [[Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] junior tournament in 2003 with [[Andrea Hlav\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1]].<ref>http://www.itftennis.com/juniors/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100000309</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===2001\u20132003===\nWolfe began competing as Jarmila Gajdo\u0161ov\u00e1 on the [[ITF Women's Circuit|ITF Circuit]] just days after her 14th birthday in 2001, and that year entered three [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tournaments, winning two matches and losing three. In 2002, she again entered only three tournaments, but this time won four matches and lost three.\n\nEarly in 2003, still aged 15, she stepped up her schedule, and that February she reached the semifinal of a $25k tournament at Redbridge, defeating [[S\u00e9verine Beltrame]], [[Sandra Kl\u00f6sel]], and [[Roberta Vinci]] before losing to [[Olga Barabanschikova]]. She won the next tournament she entered, her third of the year and only the ninth of her career. It was the $10k event at Rabat in March; and in the semifinal she defeated [[Ekaterina Bychkova]]. On the strength of this result, she found herself wildcarded into qualifying for her first WTA Tour event, a clay-court tournament at Budapest in April, and justified the wildcard by defeating all three of her opponents in the qualifying draw, including [[Melinda Czink]], in straight sets, then [[Virginie Razzano]] in the second round of the main draw, before losing 4\u20136, 3\u20136 to [[Alicia Molik]].\n\nOn her 16th birthday she entered qualifying for a $50k event on grass at Gifu, Japan. Again, she qualified defeating [[Aiko Nakamura]] in the qualifying round; and she reached the second round of the main draw before losing to another top Japanese player, [[Akiko Morigami]]. The next week, she came through three straight matches in qualifying at her third successive event, another Japanese $50k grass-court tournament at Fukuoka, defeating [[Sanda Mami\u0107]] of Croatia in the qualifying round, before advancing to the quarterfinal of the main draw after a second-round victory over [[Zheng Jie]], only to lose to [[Saori Obata]].\n\nAt the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in August, she reached the final round of qualifying with upset of [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]], but ultimately lost to [[Anik\u00f3 Kapros]] of Hungary. Her season ended with two more losses in the later stages of qualifying draws at WTA events to higher ranked players. The 16-year-old Slovak ended the year ranked No. 197.<ref>http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9530/title/jarmila-gajdosova</ref>\n\n===2004\u20132005===\nIn 2004, she suffered six successive losses between August and October. Earlier in the season she scored wins over [[Lilia Osterloh]] and [[Tzipora Obziler]] in qualifying for Memphis, [[Akiko Morigami]] and [[Tiffany Dabek]] at Fukuoka, [[Zuzana Ondr\u00e1\u0161kov\u00e1]] in Wimbledon qualifying, and [[Elena Baltacha]] in a $50k event at Lexington, while her performance in reaching the final of the $50k event at Fukuoka was her career-best in a tournament of its class. Her year-end ranking was world No. 217.\n\nIn February 2005, she qualified for the annual WTA Tour event at Hyderabad, and beat [[Li Ting (tennis, born 1980)|Li Ting]] in the first round of the main draw before losing to [[Anna-Lena Gr\u00f6nefeld]] of Germany. She did not play in March or April, but returned in May to win her first $25k event and her second career tournament on the clay of Catania, Italy beating [[Ivana Abramovi\u0107]] of Croatia in the final. The following week, she reached the quarterfinal of another $50k event at Saint-Gaudens, France beating Argentine [[Mar\u00eda Emilia Salerni]] and French player [[Pauline Parmentier]] to this end. She entered qualifying at the [[French Open]], and defeated [[Shikha Uberoi]] but lost to [[Sofia Arvidsson]] in the second leg.\n\nOver May and June, the 18-year-old suffered two consecutive losses in $25k tournaments to Chinese player [[Yuan Meng]]. She was able to win her second $25k tournament of the year and third career title on the grass courts of Felixstowe in July, beating [[Katie O'Brien]] of Great Britain in the semifinal and [[Alla Kudryavtseva]] in the final. The following week, she reached the semifinals of the $50k event at Vittel, France with wins over German [[Jana Kandarr]] and her countrywoman [[Sandra Kl\u00f6sel]].\n\nFor the second successive summer, she experienced several consecutive early defeats. But in late September she defeated [[Alona Bondarenko]], [[Kateryna Bondarenko]], and [[Mar\u00eda Emilia Salerni]] to qualify for the WTA event at Luxembourg, in the first round of which she defeated [[Katarina Srebotnik]] in two close sets before losing to [[Dinara Safina]]. She had improved her year-end ranking to No. 147.<ref>http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9530/title/jarmila-gajdosova</ref>\n\n===2006: Top 100 breakthrough and first WTA doubles titles===\nThe 18-year-old Gajdo\u0161ov\u00e1 came through the qualifying draw to gain entry to her first Grand Slam main draw at the [[Australian Open]]. She then lost a close three set first-round match to [[Martina M\u00fcller (tennis)|Martina M\u00fcller]] of Germany. But the ranking points accrued were sufficient to lift her to world No. 117 on 6 February 2006.\n\nStaying in Australia for the rest of the month, she retreated temporarily to the ITF Circuit, winning two $25k tournaments in consecutive weeks, at Gosford and Sydney, the fourth and fifth ITF singles titles of her career. These two minor tournament victories resulted in her ranking rising to No. 106.\n\nIn mid-March, she followed up these two tournament victories by entering another $25k event at Canberra, and again came through as the victor, defeating world No. 178, [[Hanna Nooni]], in the semifinals and Australian [[Monique Adamczak]] in the final.\n\nThe next week, she extended her winning streak to seventeen matches in reaching the quarterfinals of a $25k event in Melbourne, but then lost to Australian world No. 260 [[Sophie Ferguson]], 1\u20136, 4\u20136.

Mackenzie concluded that the speakers of these three languages form a unity within Northwestern Iranian languages. He has tried to reconstruct such a Persian-Kurdish-Baluchi linguistic unity presumably in the central parts of Iran. According to his theory, the Persians (or Proto-Persians) occupied the [[Fars Province|province of Fars]] in the southwest (proceeding from the fact that the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] spoke Persian), the [[Baloch people|Balochs]] (Proto-Balochs) inhabited the central areas of Western Iran, and the Kurds (Proto-Kurds), in the wording of G. Windfuhr (1975: 459), lived either in northwestern [[Lorest\u0101n Province|Luristan]] or in the [[Isfahan Province|province of Isfahan]].<ref>Professor Garnik Asatrian (Yerevan University) (2009). \"Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds\", ''Iran and the Caucasus'', Vol. 13, pp. 1\u201358, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Ethnogenesis==\nThe term ''kurd'' is used in the 16th century by [[Sherefxan Bidlisi]] as encompassing four \ntribal groups,  the ''[[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanj]]'', ''[[Lurs|Lur]]'', ''[[Kalhor (tribe)|Kalhor]]'' and ''[[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Guran]]'', each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. \nPaul (2008) argues that this marks an incipient ethnogenesis of the Kurds as a coherent Northwestern Iranian group, as three out of these four groups can be identified as the ancestors of groups that at least partially identify as Kurdish today, while the ''Lurs'' are not a Kurdish group, and indeed do not belong to the Northwest Iranian but to the [[Southwestern Iranian]] linguistic phylum.\nPaul further notes that the first texts that identifiably are written in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] appear during the same period.<ref>Ludwig Paul [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i   \"HISTORY OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE\"], ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' (2008) writes about the problem of attaining a coherent definition of \"Kurdish language\" within the Northwestern Iranian dialect continuum. \nThere is no unambiguous evolution of Kurdish from Middle Iranian, as \"from Old and Middle Iranian times, no predecessors of the Kurdish language are yet known; the extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE.\"\nLudwig further states:\n\"Linguistics itself, or dialectology, does not provide any general or straightforward definition of at which point a language becomes a dialect (or vice versa).

One details the Kurds as being the descendants of [[King Solomon]]\u2019s angelic servants ([[Djinn]]). These were sent to Europe to bring him five-hundred beautiful maidens, for the king's harem. However, when these had done so and returned to Israel the king had already died. As such, the Djinn settled in the mountains, married the women themselves, and their offspring came to be known as the Kurds.<ref>Kahn, M. (1980).

Unknowingly to Zahak, the cooks of the palace saved one of the men, and mixed the brains of the other with those of a sheep. The men that were saved were told to flee to the mountains. Hereafter, [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]], who had already lost several of his children to Zahak, trained the men in the mountains, and stormed Zahak's palace, severing the heads of the snakes and killing the tyrannical king. Kaveh was instilled as the new king, and his followers formed the beginning of the Kurdish people.<ref>Masudi. ''Les Prairies d\u2019Or''. Trans. Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille, 9 vols.

He states to have learned of this legend from a certain ''Mighdis\u00ee'', an Armenian historian:\n\n{{quote|According to the chronicler Mighdis\u00ee, the first town to be built after Noah's Flood was the town of Judi, followed by the fortresses of Sinjar and Mifariqin. The town of Judi was ruled by Melik K\u00fcrdim of the Prophet Noah's community, a man who lived no less than 600 years and who travelled the length and width of Kurdistan. Coming to Mifariqin he liked its climate and settled there, begetting many children and descendants. He invented a language of his own, independent of Hebrew. It is neither Hebrew nor Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], Dari or Pahlavi; they still call it the language of K\u00fcrdim. So the Kurdish language, which was invented in Mifariqin and is now used throughout Kurdistan, owes its name to Melik K\u00fcrdim of the community of the Prophet Noah. Because Kurdistan is an endless stony stretch of mountains, there are no less than twelve varieties of Kurdish, differing from one another in pronunciation and vocabulary, so that they often have to use interpreters to understand one another's words.<ref>Van Bruinessen, M.

He states to have learned of this legend from a certain ''Mighdis\u00ee'', an Armenian historian:\n\n{{quote|According to the chronicler Mighdis\u00ee, the first town to be built after Noah's Flood was the town of Judi, followed by the fortresses of Sinjar and Mifariqin. The town of Judi was ruled by Melik K\u00fcrdim of the Prophet Noah's community, a man who lived no less than 600 years and who travelled the length and width of Kurdistan. Coming to Mifariqin he liked its climate and settled there, begetting many children and descendants. He invented a language of his own, independent of Hebrew. It is neither Hebrew nor Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], Dari or Pahlavi; they still call it the language of K\u00fcrdim. So the Kurdish language, which was invented in Mifariqin and is now used throughout Kurdistan, owes its name to Melik K\u00fcrdim of the community of the Prophet Noah. Because Kurdistan is an endless stony stretch of mountains, there are no less than twelve varieties of Kurdish, differing from one another in pronunciation and vocabulary, so that they often have to use interpreters to understand one another's words.<ref>Van Bruinessen, M.

In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called ''Aish'' or ''Ash'' (\u05d0\u05e9).\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Three Country Point, Vaalserberg, April 2018.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Three-Country Point, where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet up the [[Vaalserberg]]]]\n\nAachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse\u2013Rhine Euroregion]], close to [[Vaalserberg#Three-Country Point|the border tripoint of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium]].

The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]].

While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.\n\nAlong the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[D\u00fcren]] earthquake<ref name=\"duerenEQ\">{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.</ref> and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],<ref name=\"Roermond\">{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.</ref> which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]]\n\nAachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.<ref name=\"Zensus 2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen |title=Bev\u00f6lkerung im Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln |accessdate=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408003047/https://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}.</ref> At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population.<ref name=\"StatJahrbuch2009\">{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}.</ref> A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]].<ref>{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013a}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], with portions of the original [[opus sectile]] floor still visible.<ref name=\"DofA4\" /> The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt.

The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel).<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of Christ, and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. Part of the [[Aachen Cathedral#Pala d'Oro|Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] were made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once \"crowned\" the [[Karlsschrein|Shrine of Charlemagne]], which was placed underneath in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Matar\u00e9]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" />\n\n=== Aachen Rathaus ===\n{{Main|Aachen Rathaus}}[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]]\nThe Aachen Rathaus, (English: Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall) dated from 1330,<ref name=\"WB\">{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}</ref> lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside one can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here.<ref name=\"young2\" />\n\nSince 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-Andr\u00e9-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lef\u00e8vre]] are viewable as part of the tour.\n\nAs before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.\n\n=== Other sights ===\nThe ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in central Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the city hall until the present building took over this function.\n\nThe ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].\n\nAlso of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), half a mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.\n\n[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine [[mannerism]], and a sample of a local [[Renaissance architecture]]. The rich fa\u00e7ade remained unfinished until 1891, when the architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.\n\nThe synagogue in Aachen, which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}.</ref> One of the contributors to the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[J\u00fcrgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.\n\nThere are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others.

Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.\n* Asteroid [[274835 Aachen]], discovered by amateur astronomer [[Erwin Schwab]] in 2009, was named after the city.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" /> The official {{MoMP|274835|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 8 November 2019 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 118221}}).<ref name=\"MPC-Circulars-Archive\" />\n \n== Education ==\n[[File:Aachen RWTH Hauptgebaeude.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of RWTH Aachen University]]\n[[File:Aachen-ElegantStreet.JPG|thumb|right|Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] houses]]\n[[File:Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century Gr\u00fcnderzeit houses (2).JPG|thumb|Another example of Aachen early 20th-century Gr\u00fcnderzeit houses]]\n\n[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science|2009}}.</ref> Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).\n\n[[FH Aachen]], Aachen University of Applied Sciences (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as [[mechatronics]], construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or ''Doppelabschl\u00fcsse'' (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.\n\nThe Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen \u2013 Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia \u2013 Aachen department)<ref>{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014}}.</ref> offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014a}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln]] ([[Cologne University of Music]]) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe<ref>{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014}}.</ref> with one of its three campuses in Aachen.<ref>{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014a}}.</ref> The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the [[Theater Aachen]] and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.\n\nThe [[German army]]'s Technical School (''Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme'') is in Aachen.<ref name=\"MeerOpitz1998\">{{harvnb|Van der Meer|Richter|Opitz|1998|p=718}}.</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Tivoli-Ost-Trib\u00fcne.JPG|thumb|left|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]]]]\n\nThe annual CHIO (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].\n\nThe local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run in Germany's [[Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|\"Tivoli\"]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.<ref name=\"GdawietzLeroi2007\">{{harvnb|Gdawietz|Leroi|2008|p=28}}.</ref> Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium \"Neuer Tivoli\" \u2013 meaning [[New Tivoli]]\u2014a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.\n\nThe Ladies in Black women's volleyball team (part of the \"PTSV Aachen\" sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.\n\n== Transport ==\n=== Rail ===\nAachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the [[Cologne\u2013Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne\u2013Aachen railway line]]. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen\u2013M\u00f6nchengladbach railway|M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Li\u00e8ge]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.\n\nThere are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]].\n\n===Intercity bus stations===\nThere are two stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Aachen: [[Aachen West station]], in the north-west of the city, and Aachen Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe, in the north-east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|last=Travelinho|title=Aachen: Stations|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bi-articulated bus]] of the city's transit authority ASEAG, at the [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]] bus stop]]\n\nThe first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it was with maximal {{convert|213.5|km|mi}} in 1915 the fourth-longest tram system in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)|Stolberg]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from poorly-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals\u2013Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum.\n\nToday, the ASEAG (''Aachener Stra\u00dfenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally \"Aachen tram and power supply company\") operates a {{convert|1240.8|km|mi}} long bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively. ASEAG is one of the main participants in the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (AVV), a tariff association in the region. Along with ASEAG, city bus routes of Aachen are served by private contractors such as Sadar, Taeter, Schl\u00f6mer, or [[DB Regio Bus]]. Line 350, which runs from [[Maastricht]], also enters Aachen.\n\n=== Roads ===\nAachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (west-east), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (north-south) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.\n\n=== Airport ===\n[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 nautical miles (28&nbsp;km; 17&nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.\n\nRecreational aviation is served by the (formerly military) [[Aachen Merzbr\u00fcck Airfield]].\n\n== Charlemagne Prize ==\n{{main|Charlemagne Prize}}\n[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]]\n\nSince 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]].\n\nThe International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an \"Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal\", which was awarded for the only time ever.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of

[[Bronze Age]] (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples<ref>{{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}.</ref> who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshipped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.\n\nLater, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], around 124 AD.

The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the \"Aachener Reich\". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|duke of J\u00fclich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.\n\nAs an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent{{clarify|date=December 2016}} of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages.

In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called ''Aish'' or ''Ash'' (\u05d0\u05e9).\n\n=== 21st century ===\nThe city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Three Country Point, Vaalserberg, April 2018.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Three-Country Point, where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet up the [[Vaalserberg]]]]\n\nAachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse\u2013Rhine Euroregion]], close to [[Vaalserberg#Three-Country Point|the border tripoint of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium]]. The town of [[Vaals]] in the Netherlands lies nearby at about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen's city centre, while the Dutch city of [[Heerlen]] and [[Eupen]], the capital of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], are both located about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]].\n\nThe maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|1|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|1|abbr=on}} from east to west.

Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.<ref name=\"climate\">{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}.</ref>\n\nBecause the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity.

The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]].

While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.\n\nAlong the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[D\u00fcren]] earthquake<ref name=\"duerenEQ\">{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.</ref> and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],<ref name=\"Roermond\">{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.</ref> which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]]\n\nAachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.<ref name=\"Zensus 2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen |title=Bev\u00f6lkerung im Regierungsbezirk K\u00f6ln |accessdate=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408003047/https://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}.</ref> At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population.<ref name=\"StatJahrbuch2009\">{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}.</ref> A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]].<ref>{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013a}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was modelled after the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], in [[Ravenna]], Italy,<ref name=\"AAE\" /> and was built by [[Odo of Metz]].<ref name=\"EA\" /> Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the [[Lateran Palace]], both in quality and authority.<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> It was originally built in the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome.<ref name=\"DofA4\">{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=3}}.</ref> On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], with portions of the original [[opus sectile]] floor still visible.<ref name=\"DofA4\" /> The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt. Finally, a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] was added around the start of the 15th century.<ref name=\"DofA5\" />\n\nAfter [[Frederick Barbarossa]] [[Canonisation|canonised]] Charlemagne in 1165 the chapel became a [[Pilgrimage|destination for pilgrims]].<ref name=\"DofA5\" /> For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens.

The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel).<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of Christ, and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. Part of the [[Aachen Cathedral#Pala d'Oro|Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] were made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once \"crowned\" the [[Karlsschrein|Shrine of Charlemagne]], which was placed underneath in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" /> Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Matar\u00e9]].<ref name=\"DofA6\" />\n\n=== Aachen Rathaus ===\n{{Main|Aachen Rathaus}}[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]]\nThe Aachen Rathaus, (English: Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall) dated from 1330,<ref name=\"WB\">{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}</ref> lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside one can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here.<ref name=\"young2\" />\n\nSince 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-Andr\u00e9-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lef\u00e8vre]] are viewable as part of the tour.\n\nAs before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.\n\n=== Other sights ===\nThe ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in central Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the city hall until the present building took over this function.\n\nThe ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].\n\nAlso of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), half a mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.\n\n[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine [[mannerism]], and a sample of a local [[Renaissance architecture]]. The rich fa\u00e7ade remained unfinished until 1891, when the architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.\n\nThe synagogue in Aachen, which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}.</ref> One of the contributors to the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[J\u00fcrgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.\n\nThere are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others.

Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.\n* Asteroid [[274835 Aachen]], discovered by amateur astronomer [[Erwin Schwab]] in 2009, was named after the city.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" /> The official {{MoMP|274835|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 8 November 2019 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 118221}}).<ref name=\"MPC-Circulars-Archive\" />\n \n== Education ==\n[[File:Aachen RWTH Hauptgebaeude.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of RWTH Aachen University]]\n[[File:Aachen-ElegantStreet.JPG|thumb|right|Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] houses]]\n[[File:Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century Gr\u00fcnderzeit houses (2).JPG|thumb|Another example of Aachen early 20th-century Gr\u00fcnderzeit houses]]\n\n[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science|2009}}.</ref> Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).\n\n[[FH Aachen]], Aachen University of Applied Sciences (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as [[mechatronics]], construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or ''Doppelabschl\u00fcsse'' (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.\n\nThe Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen \u2013 Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia \u2013 Aachen department)<ref>{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014}}.</ref> offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014a}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Tanz K\u00f6ln]] ([[Cologne University of Music]]) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe<ref>{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014}}.</ref> with one of its three campuses in Aachen.<ref>{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014a}}.</ref> The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the [[Theater Aachen]] and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.\n\nThe [[German army]]'s Technical School (''Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme'') is in Aachen.<ref name=\"MeerOpitz1998\">{{harvnb|Van der Meer|Richter|Opitz|1998|p=718}}.</ref>\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Tivoli-Ost-Trib\u00fcne.JPG|thumb|left|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]]]]\n\nThe annual CHIO (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].\n\nThe local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run in Germany's [[Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|\"Tivoli\"]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.<ref name=\"GdawietzLeroi2007\">{{harvnb|Gdawietz|Leroi|2008|p=28}}.</ref> Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium \"Neuer Tivoli\" \u2013 meaning [[New Tivoli]]\u2014a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.\n\nThe Ladies in Black women's volleyball team (part of the \"PTSV Aachen\" sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.\n\n== Transport ==\n=== Rail ===\nAachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the [[Cologne\u2013Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne\u2013Aachen railway line]]. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen\u2013M\u00f6nchengladbach railway|M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Li\u00e8ge]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.\n\nThere are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]].\n\n===Intercity bus stations===\nThere are two stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Aachen: [[Aachen West station]], in the north-west of the city, and Aachen Wilmersdorfer Stra\u00dfe, in the north-east.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|last=Travelinho|title=Aachen: Stations|accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Public transport ===\n[[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bi-articulated bus]] of the city's transit authority ASEAG, at the [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]] bus stop]]\n\nThe first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it was with maximal {{convert|213.5|km|mi}} in 1915 the fourth-longest tram system in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)|Stolberg]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from poorly-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals\u2013Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum.\n\nToday, the ASEAG (''Aachener Stra\u00dfenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally \"Aachen tram and power supply company\") operates a {{convert|1240.8|km|mi}} long bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively. ASEAG is one of the main participants in the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (AVV), a tariff association in the region. Along with ASEAG, city bus routes of Aachen are served by private contractors such as Sadar, Taeter, Schl\u00f6mer, or [[DB Regio Bus]]. Line 350, which runs from [[Maastricht]], also enters Aachen.\n\n=== Roads ===\nAachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (west-east), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (north-south) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.\n\n=== Airport ===\n[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 nautical miles (28&nbsp;km; 17&nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.\n\nRecreational aviation is served by the (formerly military) [[Aachen Merzbr\u00fcck Airfield]].\n\n== Charlemagne Prize ==\n{{main|Charlemagne Prize}}\n[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]]\n\nSince 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]].\n\nThe International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an \"Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal\", which was awarded for the only time ever.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main|List of
