On March 3, 1904, in a twelve-round bout at the Riverview Athletic Club with Jack Desmond in Lowell, Massachusetts, Walsh's opponent was in a dazed condition by the third round, and it became apparent to those present, Desmond \"was not in Walsh's class.\"  The draw ruling, in the opinion of the ''Boston Post'', was a clear victory for Walsh as they wrote Desmond \"nearly collapsed\" by the final round.<ref>''Boston Post'', Boston, Massachusetts, 3 March 1904, p.3.</ref>\n\n===First widely recognized World Bantamweight Title match===\nHe competed for what could be considered his first shot at the World Bantamweight Title on April 18, 1904, in a twelve-round loss to London-born Brit [[Digger Stanley]] in London, billed as the 112 pound world title.

One source noted that Walsh, \"had the better of the bout from the start\", and that the blow which occurred two minutes into the sixth round was accidental.<ref>\"Monte Attell Was Carried Out\", ''The Plain Speaker'', Hazelton, Pennsylvania, 30 March 1905, p. 4.</ref> The National Boxing Association recognized Walsh's claim to the Bantamweight Championship.  The ''St. Louis Dispatch'', noted that according to most spectators ringside, the \"blow was a fair one\", though it was a \"terrific right hook\", and did notable injury to Attell. Controversy arose as to who won the bout as many observers considered the blow legal, and that \"Walsh completely had Attell at his mercy throughout the entire contest.\"<ref>''St. Louis Post Dispatch'', St. Louis, Missouri, 30 March 1905, p. 18.</ref>\n\nMonte Attell and Walsh fought again on December 21, 1908, in a fifteen-round draw at the Colliseum in San Francisco.  The bout was not considered a title fight because Walsh was unable to make the agreed upon weight.  ''The Montreal Gazette'' noted that Walsh had the better of the last four rounds, with Attell having a slight edge in the first three rounds, but that the boxing was very close for much of the fight.<ref>\"Fight a Draw\", ''The Montreal Gazette'', 22 December 1908, p. 6.</ref>\n\n==Losing the World Bantamweight Title==\nOn January 29, 1909, Walsh met [[Jimmy Reagan (boxer)|Jimmy Reagan]] at the Dreamland Rink in San Francisco for a twelve-round World Bantamweight Title match.  According to the ''Oakland Tribune'', \"Reagan led in every one of the fifteen rounds with Walsh and was entitled to the verdict,\" though admitting the \"title was a very close one.\"<ref>\"Monte Has Right to Claim Championship Title\", ''Oakland Tribune'', Oakland, California, 9 August 1909, p. 11.</ref>  Joe Woodman, Walsh's own manager, admitted that Walsh had been beaten in eight of the twelve rounds, though it was a surprise to much of the audience who believed that Reagan had been overmatched with Walsh in the days before the fight. Walsh was considered to have a more clever boxing form and finesse, particularly in the early rounds, but Reagan was the aggressor, delivering more blows, and taking the initiative in the final rounds.<ref>Smith, Eddie, \"Clever San Francisco Boy Wins Over Boston Champ\", ''Oakland Tribune'', Oakland, California, 30 January 1909, p. 15.</ref> Reagan was only eighteen at the time of his victory over Walsh and had fought in relatively few major professional bouts.<ref>\"Jimmy Reagan, World's Champion Bantam\", ''The Tacoma Times'', Tacoma, Washington, 17 February 1909, p. 2.</ref>\n\n==Late career and attempting the World Featherweight Championship against Abe Attell and Johnny Kilbane==\n[[Image:Abe Attell LOC.jpg|250 px|left|thumb|Featherweight Champion Abe Attell]]\nWalsh lost to World Featherweight Champion [[Abe Attell]] three times in title matches; on September 12, 1907 for a ten round decision in Indianapolis, on December 7, 1906, in a ten-round TKO in Los Angeles, and on February 22, 1906 for a fifteen-round decision in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in which Attell \"badly punished\" Walsh.

Moore was only seventeen at the time. It was a rare loss for Walsh, and according to one source, he lost at least six of the ten rounds. Many of Walsh's losses were to top rated boxers, and Moore had not yet distinguished himself to that extent.  He would defeat Moore in a twelve-round points decision the following month in Boston.<ref>\"Pal Moore Won\", ''The Morning News'', Wilmington, Delaware, 22 April 1910, p. 1.</ref><ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>   \n\nOn November 18, 1910, he defeated talented British boxer Sam Keller at New York's Fairmont Athletic club in a ten-round match. Walsh's victory was most clearly secured in the final round when Walsh landed repeated blows to the body. Walsh began showing an advantage by the seventh round.<ref>\"Jimmy Walsh Wins Out\", ''Ottumwa Tri-Weekly Courier'', Ottumwa, Iowa, 19 November 1910, p. 2.</ref>\n\nOn November 23, 1910, he lost decisively to [[Monte Attell]], who had recently held the bantamweight championship, in a ten-round match in San Francisco.  Walsh may have been overweight for the bout at 122 pounds, and appeared to have been most effective in the first round.  Attell evaded his opponent with clever footwork and rocked Walsh, in the brutal bout, with blows to the jaw, mouth, and nose.  Walsh was said to have been swinging wildly and ineffectively by the last four rounds.<ref>\"Monte Attell Defeats Jimmy Walsh in Ten Rounds\", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', San Francisco, California, 24 November 1910, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Attempting the World Featherweight Title against Johnny Kilbane===\nHe fought [[Johnny Kilbane]] in a World Featherweight Title match on May 21, 1912, at the Pilgrim Athletic Club in Boston, Massachusetts, to a twelve-round draw decision.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> They had previously fought in a non-title match on May 30, 1911, in a twelve-round draw bout in Canton, Ohio, that was characterized as \"full of clinches\", with neither man \"doing much hard work.\"<ref>\"Picked Up in Fight Land\", ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', Brooklyn, New York, 31 May 1911, p. 11.</ref>  \n\nThey fought for the last time on September 16, 1913, in a twelve-round bout dominated by Kilbane at the Atlas Athletic Association in Boston.  As an important late career bout, Walsh, according to one source fought primarily defensively against the featherweight champion, who probably outweighed him in the bout, as several sources wrote that Kilbane was fighting as a lightweight, heavier than his normal featherweight status. Fighting defensively, one source noted \"Walsh did not land half a dozen blows up to the tenth.\"  As an indication of his cautious boxing technique, most of Walsh's blows were with his left throughout the bout. Only in the twelfth round was Walsh clearly seen as the aggressor, but by the end of the last round Kilbane was observed to have landed more blows than Walsh.  Walsh was losing more frequently at his career neared its end, but was still boxing quality opponents, even if he was fighting cautiously.<ref>\"Johnny Kilbane Won From Jimmy Walsh\", ''Lewiston Evening Journal'', 17 December 1913, p. 5.</ref><ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 4, 1913, he fought the Jewish boxer Eddie Wallace in Brooklyn defeating him in a ten-round newspaper decision.  Wallace was a skilled featherweight who would later meet the great Benny Leonard, Lew Tendler, Freddie Welsh and Johnny Dundee in his career, though without achieving an impressive win loss record.\n\nOne of his last bouts was with Johnny Ertle, in Milwaukee, on February 25, 1914, which he lost in an eight-round newspaper decision.\n\n==Retirement from boxing and work away from the ring==\nIn late 1909, Walsh gave some boxing instruction to Charles Taft, son of President Taft, and to Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of ex-President Teddy Roosevelt, who had taken boxing at Harvard.<ref>\"Taft Hires a Boxer\", ''The Alantown Leader'', Alantown, Pennsylvania, 9 October 1909, p. 2.</ref>  In February 1913, he was giving boxing instruction to the sons of several of Brookline, Massachusetts's wealthiest families.<ref>\"Jimmy Walsh, Crack Bantamweight Now has $20,000,000\" Boxing Class, ''Altoona Tribune'', Altoona, Pennsylvania, 11 February 1913, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWalsh retired from the ring in late 1914, having attained an exceptional record with only ten losses by decision in roughly 150 matches.<ref>\"Jimmy Walsh Retires\", ''Indianapolis-Star'', Indianapolis, Indiana, 22 March 1914, p. 36.</ref>  According to one source, he worked as a head salesman for a cigar firm in Boston after retiring from boxing, and sent a son to the U.S. Naval Academy.<ref>\"Far Back\", ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', Cincinnati, Ohio, 21 May 1932, p. 17</ref>\n\nHe died on November 23, 1964.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bantamweight boxing champions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{boxrec |id=57680}}\n*[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/walsh-jimmy.htm Jimmy Walsh - CBZ Profile]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|ach}}\n|-\n{{s-vac| next =[[Joe Bowker]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=World Bantamweight Champion|years=March 29, 1905 &ndash; January 29, 1909}}\n{{s-aft| after =[[Jimmy Reagan]]}}\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walsh, Jimmy}}\n[[Category:1883 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:Bantamweight boxers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Boston]]\n[[Category:Boxers from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:World bantamweight boxing champions]]\n[[Category:World boxing champions]]\n[[Category:American male boxers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American boxer}}\n{{for|the British lightweight boxing champion of the 1930s|Jimmy Walsh (boxer)}}\n{{Infobox boxer\n|name        = Jimmy Walsh\n|image       = WalshJimmy1912.JPG\n|imagesize   = 250 px\n|caption     = Walsh as a young boxer circa 1912\n|realname    = \n|nickname    = \n|weight      = [[Bantamweight]]\n|height      = {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|2|abbr=on}}\n| reach      = {{convert|63.5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}\n|nationality = {{flagicon|United States}} American\n|birth_date  = {{Birth date|1883|07|18|mf=y}}\n|birth_place =  \n|death_date  = {{Death date and age|1964|11|23|1883|07|18|mf=y}}\n|death_place =  \n|style       = [[Orthodox stance|Orthodox]]\n|total       =  135\n|wins        =  46\n|KO          =   14\n|losses      =   19\n|draws       =   27\n|no contests =    1\n}}\n'''Jimmy Walsh''' (July 18, 1883 \u2013 November 23, 1964) was an American boxer who claimed the World Bantamweight Championship on March 29, 1905, when he defeated [[Monte Attell]], in a controversial six-round bout at the National Athletic Club in Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/bantam.htm|title=The Lineal Bantamweight Champions|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone}}</ref> His claim was recognized by the [[World Boxing Association]], at the time the National Boxing Association.

He would defeat Moore in a twelve-round points decision the following month in Boston.<ref>\"Pal Moore Won\", ''The Morning News'', Wilmington, Delaware, 22 April 1910, p. 1.</ref><ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>   \n\nOn November 18, 1910, he defeated talented British boxer Sam Keller at New York's Fairmont Athletic club in a ten-round match. Walsh's victory was most clearly secured in the final round when Walsh landed repeated blows to the body. Walsh began showing an advantage by the seventh round.<ref>\"Jimmy Walsh Wins Out\", ''Ottumwa Tri-Weekly Courier'', Ottumwa, Iowa, 19 November 1910, p. 2.</ref>\n\nOn November 23, 1910, he lost decisively to [[Monte Attell]], who had recently held the bantamweight championship, in a ten-round match in San Francisco.  Walsh may have been overweight for the bout at 122 pounds, and appeared to have been most effective in the first round.  Attell evaded his opponent with clever footwork and rocked Walsh, in the brutal bout, with blows to the jaw, mouth, and nose.  Walsh was said to have been swinging wildly and ineffectively by the last four rounds.<ref>\"Monte Attell Defeats Jimmy Walsh in Ten Rounds\", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', San Francisco, California, 24 November 1910, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Attempting the World Featherweight Title against Johnny Kilbane===\nHe fought [[Johnny Kilbane]] in a World Featherweight Title match on May 21, 1912, at the Pilgrim Athletic Club in Boston, Massachusetts, to a twelve-round draw decision.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> They had previously fought in a non-title match on May 30, 1911, in a twelve-round draw bout in Canton, Ohio, that was characterized as \"full of clinches\", with neither man \"doing much hard work.\"<ref>\"Picked Up in Fight Land\", ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', Brooklyn, New York, 31 May 1911, p. 11.</ref>  \n\nThey fought for the last time on September 16, 1913, in a twelve-round bout dominated by Kilbane at the Atlas Athletic Association in Boston.  As an important late career bout, Walsh, according to one source fought primarily defensively against the featherweight champion, who probably outweighed him in the bout, as several sources wrote that Kilbane was fighting as a lightweight, heavier than his normal featherweight status. Fighting defensively, one source noted \"Walsh did not land half a dozen blows up to the tenth.\"  As an indication of his cautious boxing technique, most of Walsh's blows were with his left throughout the bout. Only in the twelfth round was Walsh clearly seen as the aggressor, but by the end of the last round Kilbane was observed to have landed more blows than Walsh.  Walsh was losing more frequently at his career neared its end, but was still boxing quality opponents, even if he was fighting cautiously.<ref>\"Johnny Kilbane Won From Jimmy Walsh\", ''Lewiston Evening Journal'', 17 December 1913, p. 5.</ref><ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 4, 1913, he fought the Jewish boxer Eddie Wallace in Brooklyn defeating him in a ten-round newspaper decision.  Wallace was a skilled featherweight who would later meet the great Benny Leonard, Lew Tendler, Freddie Welsh and Johnny Dundee in his career, though without achieving an impressive win loss record.\n\nOne of his last bouts was with Johnny Ertle, in Milwaukee, on February 25, 1914, which he lost in an eight-round newspaper decision.\n\n==Retirement from boxing and work away from the ring==\nIn late 1909, Walsh gave some boxing instruction to Charles Taft, son of President Taft, and to Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of ex-President Teddy Roosevelt, who had taken boxing at Harvard.<ref>\"Taft Hires a Boxer\", ''The Alantown Leader'', Alantown, Pennsylvania, 9 October 1909, p. 2.</ref>  In February 1913, he was giving boxing instruction to the sons of several of Brookline, Massachusetts's wealthiest families.<ref>\"Jimmy Walsh, Crack Bantamweight Now has $20,000,000\" Boxing Class, ''Altoona Tribune'', Altoona, Pennsylvania, 11 February 1913, p. 10.</ref>\n\nWalsh retired from the ring in late 1914, having attained an exceptional record with only ten losses by decision in roughly 150 matches.<ref>\"Jimmy Walsh Retires\", ''Indianapolis-Star'', Indianapolis, Indiana, 22 March 1914, p. 36.</ref>  According to one source, he worked as a head salesman for a cigar firm in Boston after retiring from boxing, and sent a son to the U.S. Naval Academy.<ref>\"Far Back\", ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', Cincinnati, Ohio, 21 May 1932, p. 17</ref>\n\nHe died on November 23, 1964.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bantamweight boxing champions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{boxrec |id=57680}}\n*[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/walsh-jimmy.htm Jimmy Walsh - CBZ Profile]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|ach}}\n|-\n{{s-vac| next =[[Joe Bowker]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=World Bantamweight Champion|years=March 29, 1905 &ndash; January 29, 1909}}\n{{s-aft| after =[[Jimmy Reagan]]}}\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walsh, Jimmy}}\n[[Category:1883 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:Bantamweight boxers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Boston]]\n[[Category:Boxers from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:World bantamweight boxing champions]]\n[[Category:World boxing champions]]\n[[Category:American male boxers]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Diggger->Digger -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Walsh_(American_boxer)"}
