The Burmese government has denied the claim, with [[Zaw Htay]] mentioning that the absence of infection was due to the \"lifestyle and diet\" of Myanmar citizens, that \"Myanmar does not share the customs of greeting with handshakes, hugs or kisses\", as well as Myanmar citizens \"generally paying for purchases with cash instead of credit cards\", making it \"unlikely\" to spread.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bylinetimes.com/2020/03/23/the-coronavirus-crisis-myanmars-lockdown-on-truth/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325131647/https://bylinetimes.com/2020/03/23/the-coronavirus-crisis-myanmars-lockdown-on-truth/ |archive-date=25 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> His statement has been faced with some criticism.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}8. https://www.moi.gov.mm/moi:eng/?q=news/14/03/2020/id-21137<nowiki/>\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n{{Portal bar|COVID-19|Medicine|Viruses}}\n\n[[Category:2020 in Myanmar|coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic by country and territory|Myanmar]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia|Myanmar]]\n[[Category:Health in Myanmar]]\n", "name_user": "Ninjastrikers", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Myanmar"}

It is about a soldier called Thomas \"Tommo\" Peaceful, who is looking back on his life from the trenches of [[World War I]] in France. Structurally, each chapter of the book brings the reader closer to the present until the story turns to present tense.  The story especially underlines the senselessness of war and ineptitude of the commanding officer.\n\n==Plot==\nThe tale is of a young man named Thomas \"Tommo\" Peaceful, who tells the story in account format from the past to the present day events of his experiences. His eldest brother, \"Big Joe\", has learning difficulties due to brain damage at birth, and is always looked out for by his younger brothers. The earlier part of the story tells of his life as a boy, before the Great War; the tale of his love for Molly \u2013 a beautiful girl he had a lot of feelings for, whom he met on his first day at school and grew to love besottedly; and Charlie Peaceful, Tommo's brother who is older than him, but younger than Joe.\n\nAlso early on in the story Tommo and his dad go woodcutting where a tree nearly falls on Tommo. However, Tommo\u2019s dad saves him but sadly in the process gets killed by the tree. Tommo kept it a secret that he was the reason his father is dead.\n\nThe trio had grown up together; their mischievous adventures included braving the beastly \"Grandma Wolf\" (the boys' great-aunt \u2013 also referred to as the Wolfwoman) to their mother's despair and skinny-dipping, the latter leaving a large impression on Tommo. They had also seen an airplane together \u2013 the first people in their village to do so.\nCharlie, being older than Tommo, had always protected and looked out for his younger brother. Also, he and Molly become closer as they are both older than Tommo, while Tommo begins to be left out.

It is about a soldier called Thomas \"Tommo\" Peaceful, who is looking back on his life from the trenches of [[World War I]] in France. Structurally, each chapter of the book brings the reader closer to the present until the story turns to present tense.  The story especially underlines the senselessness of war and ineptitude of the commanding officer.\n\n==Plot==\nThe tale is of a young man named Thomas \"Tommo\" Peaceful, who tells the story in account format from the past to the present day events of his experiences. His eldest brother, \"Big Joe\", has learning difficulties due to brain damage at birth, and is always looked out for by his younger brothers. The earlier part of the story tells of his life as a boy, before the Great War; the tale of his love for Molly \u2013 a beautiful girl he had a lot of feelings for, whom he met on his first day at school and grew to love besottedly; and Charlie Peaceful, Tommo's brother who is older than him, but younger than Joe.\n\nAlso early on in the story Tommo and his dad go woodcutting where a tree nearly falls on Tommo. However, Tommo\u2019s dad saves him but sadly in the process gets killed by the tree. Tommo kept it a secret that he was the reason his father is dead.\n\nThe trio had grown up together; their mischievous adventures included braving the beastly \"Grandma Wolf\" (the boys' great-aunt \u2013 also referred to as the Wolfwoman) to their mother's despair and skinny-dipping, the latter leaving a large impression on Tommo. They had also seen an airplane together \u2013 the first people in their village to do so.\nCharlie, being older than Tommo, had always protected and looked out for his younger brother. Also, he and Molly become closer as they are both older than Tommo, while Tommo begins to be left out. Later, it is revealed that Molly and Charlie were secretly having sex with each other and that Molly had become pregnant with Charlie's baby.\n\nTommo became extremely heartbroken after the couple rushed to get married a short time later in the village church before Tommo and Charlie were forced to go to France to fight in World War I. All through this time, Tommo recorded his feelings in the novel. The rest of the story describes the brothers' experiences of the war: their Sergeant \"Horrible\" Hanley, the near-misses during the battle on the front line, and Charlie's continued protection of Tommo.\n\nDuring a charge of the German lines, Charlie disobeys a direct order from Sergeant Hanley and stays with Tommo while he is injured on no-man's-land. As a result, Charlie is accused of cowardice and given a court-martial. The book's chapters count down to dawn when Charlie will be executed. At dawn, Charlie is marched before the firing squad, where he dies happily singing their favorite childhood song, \"Oranges and Lemons\".\n\nThe story ends with Tommo preparing for the Battle of the Somme.\n\nIn 2006, 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers who (like Charlie) were executed for offenses including cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and sleeping at their posts were pardoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/52/section/359 |title=Armed Forces Act 2006 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Play==\nThe book was adapted into a play of the same name by [[Simon minter|Simon Reade]], first performed at the [[Bristol Old Vic]] in April 2004, and starred Alexander Campbell.

The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic. Firefighters then retreated from within the attic. Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported [[Notre-Dame de Paris#Bells|eight very large bells]]. Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral. At 20:30, firefighters abandoned attempts to extinguish the roof and concentrated on saving the towers, fighting from within and between the towers.

By the time it was extinguished, the building's [[Fl\u00e8che|spire]] and most of its roof had been destroyed and its upper walls severely damaged; extensive damage to the interior was prevented by its stone [[sexpartite vault|vaulted ceiling]], which largely contained the burning roof as it collapsed. Many works of art and religious relics were moved to safety early in the emergency, but others suffered some smoke damage, and some exterior art was damaged or destroyed. The cathedral's [[altar]], two [[pipe organ]]s, and its three 13th-century [[rose window]]s suffered little to no damage. Three emergency workers were injured.

The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic. Firefighters then retreated from within the attic. Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported [[Notre-Dame de Paris#Bells|eight very large bells]]. Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.
