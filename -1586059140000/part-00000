The network currently consists of three passenger routes, the [[Dulwich Hill Line|L1 Dulwich Hill]], [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L2 Randwick]] and [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L3 Kingsford]] lines. A separate light rail network serving Western Sydney called [[Parramatta Light Rail]] is also under construction as of 2020, and is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\nThe network is controlled by [[Transport for NSW]], with day-to-day operation contracted to [[Transdev Australasia#Transdev Sydney|Transdev]]. In the year ended June 2019, 11.1&nbsp;million passenger journeys were made on the network, which only consisted of L1 at the time.\n\n==History==\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an [[Trams in Sydney|extensive tram network]], which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the [[Commonwealth]] after [[Trams in London|London]]. The increasing rate of private car ownership, perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due the lack of funding after [[World War II]] led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.\n\n[[File:Fish Market light rail stop 1997 (4731800705).jpg|thumb|left|A Sydney Light Rail service in 1997 at the then-new [[Dulwich Hill Line#Fish Market|Fish Market station]]]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of [[Darling Harbour]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the [[Sydney Monorail]] opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the [[Sydney central business district|central business district]]. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes, and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula \u2013 including the establishment of [[The Star, Sydney|Sydney's first legal casino]] \u2013 it was decided to convert a disused section of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The line was set up as a [[public-private partnership]]. It opened in August 1997, running between Central station and [[Wentworth Park]], Pyrmont.\n\nThe private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the central business district from Central to [[Circular Quay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominated Loan Council Allocations For 1998\u201399|url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/1998/047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|website=The Australian Treasury Website|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=7 May 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406195711/http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F1998%2F047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at [[Lilyfield]], but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.\n\nBy contrast, the 2010s have seen major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city's other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership. The extensions announced during the decade total almost {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}.

Opal is also valid on bus, train and ferry services but separate fares apply for these modes. Opal's light rail fares are the same as those for buses but the fares are not combined when interchanging between the two modes. This is due to change once the CBD and South East Light Rail opens; all light rail passengers interchanging with buses will only pay one fare, calculated from the start of their trip on one mode to the end of their trip on the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opal to go live on light rail months ahead of schedule|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=24 November 2014|access-date=24 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201221153/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|archive-date=1 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page Opal rollout extends to light rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071610/http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page |date= 6 October 2014 }} Transport Info NSW 25 November 2014</ref> Light rail stops feature Opal top-up machines that also sell Opal single trip tickets.

No two stops on the existing line are located more than eight kilometres from each other using this method, so the 8&nbsp;km+ band doesn't apply to light rail services.\n\nWhen it first opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its own paper-based ticketing system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors on board. During the 2010s this system gradually merged with the broader Sydney ticketing system, culminating in the introduction of Opal and the withdrawal of all other tickets.

The network currently consists of three passenger routes, the [[Dulwich Hill Line|L1 Dulwich Hill]], [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L2 Randwick]] and [[CBD and South East Light Rail|L3 Kingsford]] lines. A separate light rail network serving Western Sydney called [[Parramatta Light Rail]] is also under construction as of 2020, and is scheduled for completion in 2023.\n\nThe network is controlled by [[Transport for NSW]], with day-to-day operation contracted to [[Transdev Australasia#Transdev Sydney|Transdev]]. In the year ended June 2019, 11.1&nbsp;million passenger journeys were made on the network, which only consisted of L1 at the time.\n\n==History==\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an [[Trams in Sydney|extensive tram network]], which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the [[Commonwealth]] after [[Trams in London|London]]. The increasing rate of private car ownership, perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due the lack of funding after [[World War II]] led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.\n\n[[File:Fish Market light rail stop 1997 (4731800705).jpg|thumb|left|A Sydney Light Rail service in 1997 at the then-new [[Dulwich Hill Line#Fish Market|Fish Market station]]]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of [[Darling Harbour]] and [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the [[Sydney Monorail]] opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the [[Sydney central business district|central business district]]. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes, and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula \u2013 including the establishment of [[The Star, Sydney|Sydney's first legal casino]] \u2013 it was decided to convert a disused section of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and [[Haymarket, New South Wales|Haymarket]] was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]]. The line was set up as a [[public-private partnership]]. It opened in August 1997, running between Central station and [[Wentworth Park]], Pyrmont.\n\nThe private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the central business district from Central to [[Circular Quay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nominated Loan Council Allocations For 1998\u201399|url=http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases/1998/047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|website=The Australian Treasury Website|accessdate=12 December 2015|date=7 May 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406195711/http://ministers.treasury.gov.au/DisplayDocs.aspx?doc=pressreleases%2F1998%2F047.htm&pageID=003&min=phc&Year=1998&DocType=0|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at [[Lilyfield]], but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.\n\nBy contrast, the 2010s have seen major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city's other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership.

Opal is also valid on bus, train and ferry services but separate fares apply for these modes. Opal's light rail fares are the same as those for buses but the fares are not combined when interchanging between the two modes. This is due to change once the CBD and South East Light Rail opens; all light rail passengers interchanging with buses will only pay one fare, calculated from the start of their trip on one mode to the end of their trip on the other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Opal to go live on light rail months ahead of schedule|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=24 November 2014|access-date=24 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201221153/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/opal-go-live-light-rail-months-ahead-schedule|archive-date=1 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page Opal rollout extends to light rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071610/http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/transport-status/news/2014/opal-rollout.page |date= 6 October 2014 }} Transport Info NSW 25 November 2014</ref> Light rail stops feature Opal top-up machines that also sell Opal single trip tickets.

No two stops on the existing line are located more than eight kilometres from each other using this method, so the 8&nbsp;km+ band doesn't apply to light rail services.\n\nWhen it first opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its own paper-based ticketing system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors on board. During the 2010s this system gradually merged with the broader Sydney ticketing system, culminating in the introduction of Opal and the withdrawal of all other tickets. This process was completed on 1 August 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=The last paper tickets to be wrapped up on August 1|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/last-paper-tickets-be-wrapped-august-1|publisher=Transport for NSW|date=4 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706072443/http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/last-paper-tickets-be-wrapped-august-1|archivedate=6 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Potential extensions==\nSeveral transport corridors have significant potential to allow for the growth of the network beyond its current route structure.\n\n===Anzac Parade===\n[[File:Anzac Parade through Kingsford and Maroubra from the air.jpg|thumb|The southern section of Anzac Parade retains the wide median used by the former tram network.]]\nThe New South Wales Government's 2012 policy document entitled ''Sydney's Light Rail Future'' proposed investigating an extension of the CBD and South East Light Rail along the southern [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] corridor.<ref name=TransportNSW13Dec12>{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/b2b/publications/sydneys-light-rail-future.pdf|title=Sydney's Light Rail Future|publisher=[[Transport for NSW]]|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=17 March 2017|pages=20}}</ref>\n\nBy 2014 an initial investigation had commenced.

In 1782, [[Fredric Henric af Chapman]] was charged by [[Gustav III of Sweden|King Gustav III]] to modernize shipbuilding methods in order to create a large new fleet. Chapman's success in building 10 ships of the line and 10 frigates in just three years brought a new period of prosperity. Over the years, there have been bakers, distillers, brewers, butchers, a textiles factory and, as both water and provisions were generally stored in barrels, a coopers\u2019 workshop on the island. Today as a result of building dikes and landfill pads between Stumholmen and the islands of Laboratorieholmen and Bastion Kungshall, the area is seen as a single island. There are military buildings from the early 18th century, some designed by the commander in chief of the naval base, [[Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd]], who had taken an interest in Greek and Roman architecture. The navy yard continued to be expanded until the 1950s. Stumholmen was a great military workplace until the 1970s but is now a civilian area. As a result of an architectural competition, preservation work on 17 buildings was undertaken in the 1990s adhering to the general pr\u00ednciple of \"a quality conscious conversion of an historic environment\". Development of residential facilities has provided over 150 apartments on the island, all reserved for rental or purchase by senior citizens. Occupants are offered car parking space as well as a boat space nearby. In 1998, the [[Karlskrona naval base|Naval city of Karlskrona]] became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref name=Interreg/><ref>[http://www.orlogsstadenkarlskrona.se/page/91/stadsplanen.aspx \"The City Plan\"], ''The Naval City of Karlskrona''.

The foundations of the museum were laid in 1752 when [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|King Adolf Frederick]] established the Navy's model chamber with artifacts representing the various vessels. From 1953 to 1997, the Naval Museum was located in the former Ship Goss Barracks outside the naval harbor. Since June 1997, it has been on the island of Stumholmen. The classic main facade is designed to harmonize with the 18th century Sloop and Longboat Shed. The museum projects like a pier out into the sea. It includes an underwater observation tunnel, a naval warfare gallery, a full-scale reconstruction of the gun-deck of the Dristigheten and an exhibition of ship's figureheads, most of which were carved by the 18th-century sculptor [[Johan T\u00f6rnstr\u00f6m]].

Hardtack biscuits were baked for long voyages and soft anchor bread for those on shore duty. Flour boats with rye flour from Lyckaby Crown Mill were able to moor next to the bakery which is seen as an early example of industrial production. On the ground floor there were eight ovens, the first floor housed a kiln while the second floor was used for storing bread and flour. The facility was extended around 1908 with an additional floor and was used as a clothing store.

In 1782, [[Fredric Henric af Chapman]] was charged by [[Gustav III of Sweden|King Gustav III]] to modernize shipbuilding methods in order to create a large new fleet. Chapman's success in building 10 ships of the line and 10 frigates in just three years brought a new period of prosperity. Over the years, there have been bakers, distillers, brewers, butchers, a textiles factory and, as both water and provisions were generally stored in barrels, a coopers\u2019 workshop on the island. Today as a result of building dikes and landfill pads between Stumholmen and the islands of Laboratorieholmen and Bastion Kungshall, the area is seen as a single island. There are military buildings from the early 18th century, some designed by the commander in chief of the naval base, [[Carl August Ehrensv\u00e4rd]], who had taken an interest in Greek and Roman architecture. The navy yard continued to be expanded until the 1950s. Stumholmen was a great military workplace until the 1970s but is now a civilian area. As a result of an architectural competition, preservation work on 17 buildings was undertaken in the 1990s adhering to the general pr\u00ednciple of \"a quality conscious conversion of an historic environment\". Development of residential facilities has provided over 150 apartments on the island, all reserved for rental or purchase by senior citizens. Occupants are offered car parking space as well as a boat space nearby. In 1998, the [[Karlskrona naval base|Naval city of Karlskrona]] became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref name=Interreg/><ref>[http://www.orlogsstadenkarlskrona.se/page/91/stadsplanen.aspx \"The City Plan\"], ''The Naval City of Karlskrona''.

The foundations of the museum were laid in 1752 when [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|King Adolf Frederick]] established the Navy's model chamber with artifacts representing the various vessels. From 1953 to 1997, the Naval Museum was located in the former Ship Goss Barracks outside the naval harbor. Since June 1997, it has been on the island of Stumholmen. The classic main facade is designed to harmonize with the 18th century Sloop and Longboat Shed. The museum projects like a pier out into the sea. It includes an underwater observation tunnel, a naval warfare gallery, a full-scale reconstruction of the gun-deck of the Dristigheten and an exhibition of ship's figureheads, most of which were carved by the 18th-century sculptor [[Johan T\u00f6rnstr\u00f6m]].

Flour boats with rye flour from Lyckaby Crown Mill were able to moor next to the bakery which is seen as an early example of industrial production. On the ground floor there were eight ovens, the first floor housed a kiln while the second floor was used for storing bread and flour. The facility was extended around 1908 with an additional floor and was used as a clothing store.

A year before the transit was due the French naval frigate FRWS ''Vire'', based at [[Noum\u00e9a]] and commanded by Captain J. Jacquemart, visited the island from 28 November to 25 December 1873.  The officers and crew of the ship made a thorough survey of the coastline and set up a platform for astronomical equipment on the headland between Camp Cove and Garden Cove in Perseverance Harbour and cleared a path to the beach.  They also planted a garden with potatoes, cabbages and other vegetables.<ref name=Kerr>{{cite book |title= Campbell Island: A History |author=Kerr, Ian S. |date=1976 |publisher= A.H. & A.W.

Bouquet de la Grye, a naval [[hydrography|hydrographer]], assisted by hydrographer P. Hatt and naval officer Th. Courrejolles who was in charge of the photographic equipment.  The fourth scientist was [[natural history|naturalist]] and expedition doctor [[Henri Filhol]].  They were accompanied by a support staff which included technicians, carpenters and mechanics.  The expedition departed [[Marseilles]] in June 1874.  They reached Sydney on 21 August and joined the ''Vire'' which had brought equipment from Noum\u00e9a.  They left Sydney on 2 September and arrived at Campbell Island on 9 September.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\n==Campbell Island==\n[[File:Campbell Island TOV expedition 1.JPG|thumb|right|Observatory built by the expedition on Campbell Island, 1874.]]\nAfter briefly checking North East Harbour and rejecting it as a venue for their work, they continued to [[Perseverance Harbour]] and Garden Cove.  There, finding that there was insufficient space for their encampment and equipment and that nothing had survived in the vegetable garden except for a few cabbages, they set up their camp in Venus Bay instead.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\nSeptember was occupied by unloading the ''Vire'', erecting several prefabricated buildings and constructing a 20&nbsp;m stone [[jetty]].  Pens were built for the sheep and pigs brought as food.  On 22 September one of the technicians, Paul Duris, died of [[typhoid fever]] and was buried on the point opposite Venus Bay.  The encampment was ready for occupation on 1 October.  From mid October until mid November the ''Vire'' was away and the expedition members filled their time testing their equipment and repairing that which had been damaged on the outward voyage.  Filhol collected natural history specimens and observed the wildlife.  The weather was not helpful; the expedition endured a series of storms which caused damage to the buildings.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\nOn 9 December the skies were cloudy, though as the time of the transit approached the sun appeared briefly giving the observers a view of Venus against the sun's [[solar corona|corona]]  \u2013 a view obscured by clouds at the moment of first contact.

Although observations and measurements of the transit had been unsuccessful, Filhol published a comprehensive account of his examination of the natural history of the island, while the chart produced by the naval officers subsequently formed the basis of maps of the island and British Admiralty charts for several decades.

It was one of several such scientific expeditions from various countries sent around the world to observe the rare astronomical event.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Campbell Island TOV expedition 2.JPG|thumb|right|Expedition base on Campbell Island, 1874]]\nThe expedition was conducted under the auspices of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] which established a committee to plan the operation.  A year before the transit was due the French naval frigate FRWS ''Vire'', based at [[Noum\u00e9a]] and commanded by Captain J. Jacquemart, visited the island from 28 November to 25 December 1873.  The officers and crew of the ship made a thorough survey of the coastline and set up a platform for astronomical equipment on the headland between Camp Cove and Garden Cove in Perseverance Harbour and cleared a path to the beach.  They also planted a garden with potatoes, cabbages and other vegetables.<ref name=Kerr>{{cite book |title= Campbell Island: A History |author=Kerr, Ian S. |date=1976 |publisher= A.H. & A.W.

Bouquet de la Grye, a naval [[hydrography|hydrographer]], assisted by hydrographer P. Hatt and naval officer Th. Courrejolles who was in charge of the photographic equipment.  The fourth scientist was [[natural history|naturalist]] and expedition doctor [[Henri Filhol]].  They were accompanied by a support staff which included technicians, carpenters and mechanics.  The expedition departed [[Marseilles]] in June 1874.  They reached Sydney on 21 August and joined the ''Vire'' which had brought equipment from Noum\u00e9a.  They left Sydney on 2 September and arrived at Campbell Island on 9 September.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\n==Campbell Island==\n[[File:Campbell Island TOV expedition 1.JPG|thumb|right|Observatory built by the expedition on Campbell Island, 1874.]]\nAfter briefly checking North East Harbour and rejecting it as a venue for their work, they continued to [[Perseverance Harbour]] and Garden Cove.  There, finding that there was insufficient space for their encampment and equipment and that nothing had survived in the vegetable garden except for a few cabbages, they set up their camp in Venus Bay instead.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\nSeptember was occupied by unloading the ''Vire'', erecting several prefabricated buildings and constructing a 20&nbsp;m stone [[jetty]].  Pens were built for the sheep and pigs brought as food.  On 22 September one of the technicians, Paul Duris, died of [[typhoid fever]] and was buried on the point opposite Venus Bay.  The encampment was ready for occupation on 1 October.  From mid October until mid November the ''Vire'' was away and the expedition members filled their time testing their equipment and repairing that which had been damaged on the outward voyage.  Filhol collected natural history specimens and observed the wildlife.  The weather was not helpful; the expedition endured a series of storms which caused damage to the buildings.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\nOn 9 December the skies were cloudy, though as the time of the transit approached the sun appeared briefly giving the observers a view of Venus against the sun's [[corona]]  \u2013 a view obscured by clouds at the moment of first contact.  They also had a twenty-second view of Venus at the end of the transit between third and fourth contacts as it was half off the sun's disc.  No useful measurements were able to be made.<ref name=Kerr/>\n\nIt took three weeks for the expedition to dismantle their camp and load the ship.  They departed on 28 December.  Although observations and measurements of the transit had been unsuccessful, Filhol published a comprehensive account of his examination of the natural history of the island, while the chart produced by the naval officers subsequently formed the basis of maps of the island and British Admiralty charts for several decades.  Many geographic features were named by the expedition after its own personnel and members of the transit committee in Paris, as well as for other expedition-related objects, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitofvenus.co.nz/astronomy/french_exp_1874.html |title=The French Expedition to Campbell Island in 1874 |author=Tobin, William |quote= Adapted from I.S.

The interference achieved by a diffraction grating both improves the [[spectral resolution]] over a prism and allows for the dispersed wavelengths to be quantified. Fraunhofer's establishment of a quantified wavelength scale paved the way for matching spectra observed in multiple laboratories, from multiple sources (flames and the sun) and with different instruments.

During [[World War II]], the U.S. government contracted different companies to develop a method for the polymerization of [[butadiene]] to create [[synthetic rubber|rubber]], but this could only be done through analysis of Ca hydrocarbon isomers. These contracted companies started developing optical instruments and eventually created the first infrared spectrometers. With the development of these commercial spectrometers Infrared Spectroscopy became a more popular method to determine the \"fingerprint\" for any molecule.<ref name=\":0\"/> Raman spectroscopy was first observed in 1928 by Sir [[C. V. Raman|Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]] in liquid substances and also by \"Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam in crystals\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Raman spectroscopy is based on the observation of the raman effect which is defined as \"The intensity of the scattered light is dependent on the amount of the polarization potential change\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The raman spectrum records light intensity vs. light frequency (wavenumber) and the wavenumber shift is characteristic to each individual compound.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Laser spectroscopy==\n\nLaser spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that uses [[laser]]s to be able determine the emitted frequencies of matter.<ref name=\":2\" /> The laser was invented because spectroscopists took the concept of its predecessor, the [[maser]], and applied it to the visible and infrared ranges of light.<ref name=\":2\" /> The maser was invented by [[Charles H.

The laser light allowed for much higher precision experiments specifically in the uses of studying collisional effects of light as well as being able to accurately detect specific wavelengths and frequencies of light, allowing for the invention of devices such as laser atomic clocks. Lasers also made spectroscopy that used time methods more accurate by using speeds or decay times of photons at specific wavelengths and frequencies to keep time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/spectroscopy/history/history-modern.html|title=MIT Spectroscopy Lab - History|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref> Laser spectroscopic techniques have been used for many different applications. One example is using laser spectroscopy to detect compounds in materials. One specific method is called Laser-induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and uses spectroscopic methods to be able to detect what materials are in a solid, liquid, or gas, ''[[in situ]]''.

During [[World War II]], the U.S. government contracted different companies to develop a method for the polymerization of [[butadiene]] to create [[synthetic rubber|rubber]], but this could only be done through analysis of Ca hydrocarbon isomers. These contracted companies started developing optical instruments and eventually created the first infrared spectrometers. With the development of these commercial spectrometers Infrared Spectroscopy became a more popular method to determine the \"fingerprint\" for any molecule. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Nicholas C.|date=1991-08-01|title=The early history of spectroscopy|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=68|issue=8|pages=631|doi=10.1021/ed068p631|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=1991JChEd..68..631T}}</ref> Raman spectroscopy was first observed in 1928 by Sir [[C.

The laser light allowed for much higher precision experiments specifically in the uses of studying collisional effects of light as well as being able to accurately detect specific wavelengths and frequencies of light, allowing for the invention of devices such as laser atomic clocks.

He pioneered the use of high altitude balloons for scientific investigations and helped to develop procedures and equipment that underlie modern scientific ballooning.  He was one of the first researchers to put experiments aboard spacecraft.\n\nIn 1963, Ney became one of the first infrared astronomers.  He founded [[O'Brien Observatory]], where he and his colleagues discovered that certain stars are surrounded by grains of carbon and [[silicate minerals]] and established that these grains, from which planets are formed, are ubiquitous in circumstellar winds and regions of star formation.\n\n== Early life==\nNey's father, Otto Fred Ney and mother, Jessamine Purdy Ney, lived in [[Waukon, Iowa]].  However, in October 1920, his mother went to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], where Ney was delivered by [[Caesarean section]].<ref name='ORAL'/>  After elementary school, he attended [[Waukon High School]], where he developed an interest in science and mathematics that was encouraged by Coach Howard B. Moffitt,<ref name='ACADEMY'/> who taught several of his courses and later became an administrator at the [[University of Iowa]].<ref name='MOFFITT'/>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1938, Ney began undergraduate studies at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he became acquainted with Professor [[Alfred O. C. Nier]], who was an expert in [[mass spectrometry]].  Soon, Nier recruited him to work in the spectroscopy laboratory for 35 cents per hour.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>  In February 1940,<ref name='NIER'/> Nier prepared a tiny but pure sample of [[Uranium-235]], which he mailed to [[Columbia University]], where [[John R. Dunning]] and his team proved that this [[isotope]] was responsible for [[nuclear fission]], rather than the more abundant [[Uranium-238]].  This finding was a crucial step in the development of the [[atomic bomb]].<ref name='NIER2'/>  That summer, Ney and Robert Thompson prepared a larger sample of Uranium-235, which provided material for further important tests.  Later, he helped Nier design and test mass spectrographs that were replicated for extensive use in the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name='ORAL'/>\n\n===Graduate studies in Virginia===\nIn June 1942, after graduating with a B.S. degree in physics, Ney married June Felsing.  They had four children: Judy, John, Arthur, and William.  That year, Ney took his bride and two of Nier's mass spectrographs to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]],<ref name='NIER2'/> where he began graduate studies with [[Jesse Beams]] at the [[University of Virginia]].  Ney brought experience and equipment that contributed significantly to Beams's wartime project to develop [[Gas centrifuges#History|gas centrifuges]] for [[Isotope separation#Centrifugal effect|separation of uranium isotopes]].<ref name='BEAMS'/>\n\nWith Beams as his thesis advisor, Ney measured the [[self-diffusion]] coefficient of [[uranium hexaflouride]].  At the time, his results were [[Classified information|classified]], but in 1947, they were published in the [[Physical Review]].<ref name='HEXAFLOURIDE'/>  In 1946, Ney received his Ph.D. in [[physics]] and became an assistant professor at the University of Virginia.  With Beams and Leland Swoddy, he began an underground [[cosmic rays|cosmic ray]] experiment in [[Endless Caverns]] near [[New Market, Virginia]]\n\n===Return to Minnesota===\nJohn T. Tate,<ref name='TATE'/> was an influential professor of physics at the [[University of Minnesota]], who was Nier's mentor<ref name='NIER2'/> and editor of the ''[[Physical Review]]''.<ref name='COMO'/>  After the war, he recognized the research potential of large plastic balloons, which had been invented by [[Jean Piccard]] and were being manufactured at the [[General Mills]] Laboratories in the [[Como, Minneapolis#Trivia|Como neighborhood]] of Minneapolis.  Here, [[Otto C. Winzen]] used polyethylene to make balloons whose performance at high altitudes was better than the [[Jean Piccard#Plastic balloons|cellophane ones developed by Piccard]].<ref name='WINZEN'/>   In 1947, because of Ney's interest in cosmic rays, Tate offered him a position as assistant professor, which was immediately accepted.<ref name='ORAL'/>  Except for a sabbatical and two brief leaves of absence, Ney spent the rest of his life at Minnesota.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>\n\n[[File:Cloud Chamber Photo of Heavy Nucleus.jpg|right|thumb|300px|At center right, a primary cosmic ray heavy nucleus goes vertically through a cloud chamber, which was suspended under a balloon near the top of the atmosphere. At left, a Helium nucleus enters through the side of the chamber. Thin tracks are singly charged particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Note that this is a negative image, in which white droplets appear black, and that the horizontal bars are electrodes that do not introduce any material into the chamber.<br>Photo provided by James A. Earl]]\n\n===Discovery of heavy cosmic ray nuclei===\nBack in Minneapolis, Ney met [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and [[Edward J. Lofgren]], who had both arrived about a year earlier.  In response to Tate's initiative, these three decided to use balloons to study primary cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere.  At first, they focused on developing [[cloud chamber]]s small enough to fly on balloons, but soon realized that [[nuclear emulsion]]s offer a more portable way to detect energetic particles.<ref name='ILFORD'/>  To take charge of emulsion work, they enlisted a graduate student, [[Phyllis S. Freier]], as the fourth member of their group.  Later, she became a renowned professor.<ref name='FREIER'/>  In 1948, the Minnesota group collaborated with Bernard Peters and Helmut L. Bradt, of the [[University of Rochester]], to launch a balloon flight carrying a cloud chamber and emulsions.  This flight gave evidence for heavy nuclei among the cosmic rays.<ref name='DISCOVERY'/>  More specifically,  the researchers discovered that, in addition to Hydrogen nuclei ([[Proton#Atomic number|protons]]), primary cosmic rays contain substantial numbers of fast moving nuclei of [[Chemical element|element]]s from [[Alpha particle|Helium]] to Iron.\n\nIn ordinary matter, [[atom]]s of these elements consist of a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by a cloud of electrons, but when the nuclei arrive as cosmic rays, they are devoid of electrons, because of collisions with atoms in [[Interstellar medium|interstellar matter]].  In both emulsions and cloud chambers, these \"stripped\" heavy nuclei leave an unmistakable track, which is much denser and \"hairier\" than that of protons, and whose characteristics make it possible to determine their [[atomic number]].  In further flights, the group showed that the [[Abundances of the chemical elements|abundances]] of elements in cosmic rays are similar to those found on earth and in stars.<ref name='ABUNDANCE'/>  These results had a major impact, for they showed that studies of cosmic radiation could play a significant role in [[astrophysics]].\n\nShortly after these discoveries, Lofgren left for California to build the [[Bevatron]].  In 1949, Oppenheimer was forced to resign from the Minnesota faculty, because he had concealed his prewar membership in the [[Communist Party USA]].   That year, [[John R. Winckler]] joined Minnesota's cosmic ray group.<ref name='WINCKLER'/>\n\nIn 1950, with the aid of a cloud chamber that contained lead plates,  Ney, together with [[Charles Critchfield]] and graduate student Sophie Oleksa, searched for primary cosmic ray [[electrons]].<ref name='OLEKSA'/>  They did not find them, but in 1960, James Earl, who joined the Minnesota group in 1958, used similar apparatus to discover a small primary electron component.<ref name='EARL'/>\n\nDuring the decade from 1950 to 1960, Ney's cosmic ray research shifted away from cloud chambers toward emulsions.  However, his graduate students used [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett#Academia and research|counter controlled cloud chambers]] to make significant advances in electronic instrumentation for the detection and analysis of cosmic rays.  Specifically, in 1954, [[John Linsley]] used a cloud chamber triggered by a [[cherenkov detector]] to study the charge distribution of heavy nuclei,<ref name='LINSLEY'/> and in 1955, [[Frank B. McDonald|Frank McDonald]] used one triggered by a [[scintillation counter]] for a similar purpose.  Later, McDonald combined these two electronic detectors into a balloon instrument that served as a prototype for devices carried on many spacecraft.<ref name='MCDONALD'/>\n\n===Balloon technology===\n[[File:PATENT-2872808 FIG 1.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Figure 1. From a patent: ''Tension Component Measuring Means''<br>US Patent and Trademark Office]]\n\nAlthough early plastic balloons performed spectacularly in a few cases, there were dangerous mishaps during launch and many unexplained failures in flight.  Ney realized that this unreliability was due to inadequate engineering and a fundamental lack of understanding of balloon physics.  In response, he collaborated with Critchfield and Winckler to carry out a project entitled \"Research and Development in the Field of High Altitude Plastic Balloons\", which was sponsored by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force under a contract with the [[Office of Naval Research]], Nonr-710 (01), which was in force from December 1951 until August 1956.<ref name='FINAL'/>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the United States sponsored several heavily funded and top secret attempts to carry out surveillance of the [[Soviet Union]] by means of balloon overflights .  These included: [[Project Mogul]], [[Project Moby Dick]], and [[Project Genetrix]].<ref name='GENETRIX'/>  In July 1958, responding to the disappointing results of these efforts and to the deployment of the [[Lockheed U-2]], President Eisenhower ordered an end to balloon surveillance.  Because the secret programs made use of information from the Minnesota balloon project, it too was secret, but all its materials were declassified in 1958.<ref name='PROGRESS'/>\n\nWhile the project was active, Ney and his coworkers carried out 313 major or experimental balloon flights, published 16 technical reports,<ref name='PROGRESS'/> and patented approximately 20 inventions.<ref name='PATENTS'/>  The final report lists 62 major innovations and achievements.<ref name='FINAL'/>  The innovations include the duct appendix,<ref name='DUCT'/> the natural shape balloon,<ref name='NATURAL'/> the Minnesota launch system,<ref name='LAUNCH'/> and the tetroon balloon design.<ref name='TETROON'/>  The last achievement listed was the post-project flight of a [[BoPET|mylar]] tetroon on September 7, 1956, which reached a maximum height of 145,000 feet (44,000 m) over Minneapolis.  At the time, this was a record altitude for balloons, and there was considerable press coverage of the flight.<ref name='RECORD'/>  Most of the project's balloons were launched at the University of Minnesota Airport in [[New Brighton, Minnesota]].<ref name='AIRPORT'/>  They were among more than 1000 flights launched here from 1948 until the airport was devastated by a tornado on May 6, 1965.<ref name='TORNADO'/>\n\nKey personnel of the project were:  Raymond W. Maas and William F. Huch, who provided engineering expertise, Rudolph B. Thorness, who was in charge of the physics machine shop, Robert L. Howard, who ran the electronics shop, and Leland S. Bohl,<ref name='BOHl'/> who worked on the project while earning his Ph.D. under Ney.<ref name='FINAL'/>  Many of their names appear as authors not only of patents<ref name='NATURAL'/> and technical reports,<ref name='PROGRESS'/> but also of scientific publications.<ref name='TEMP'/>\n\nIn spite of its secrecy, many of the project's balloons carried instruments for open scientific research.  For example, from January 20, 1953,  until February 4, 1953, with [[Winzen Research]], Inc, the project launched 13 flights at [[Pyote Air Force Base]] in Texas.<ref name='PYOTE'/>  Several of these carried packages for cosmic ray research, one of which was designated as \"ballast\".  These were [[Skyhook balloon|Skyhook]] flights, which is the generic term used by the Office of Naval Research to designate balloon flights whose primary objectives were scientific, rather than military.  Some milestones of more than 1500 Skyhook flights are: the first Skyhook launch (1947), the first shipboard launch (1949), the [[Rockoon]] program (1952), the tetroon record flight of September 1956, [[Stratoscope]] (1957 - 1971), and Skyhook [[Churchill Airport|Churchill]] (1959 - 1976).<ref name='CHURCHILL'/>\n\nIn 1960, the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] was established.  On October 17, 1961, its panel on scientific balloons met to select a permanent launch site for balloon operations.  Members of this panel, whose chairman was [[Verner E. Suomi]], were Ney, [[Charles B. Moore]], Alvin Howell,<ref name='HOWELL'/> James K. Angell,<ref name='ANGELL'/> [[J. Allen Hynek]], and [[Martin Schwarzschild]],<ref name='TRIMBLE'/> who was the prime mover behind Stratoscope. They chose [[Palestine, Texas]], where the [[National Scientific Balloon Facility]] (NSBF) was created in 1962.  Since then, thousands of balloons have been launched there, and it has served as the base for flight expeditions all over the world.<ref name='NSBF'/>\n\nThe Minnesota balloon project pioneered procedures and equipment used in Skyhook, NSBF, and the manned flights of Projects [[Project Strato-Lab|Stratolab]] and [[Project Manhigh|Manhigh]].  These include launch methods, design of reliable balloons, knowledge of [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] structure, and reliable instrumentation for flight control and tracking.\n\n===Atmospheric physics===\nDuring the balloon project, winds and temperatures in the atmosphere were prime subjects for investigation, for they have a critical impact on balloon performance.  To map out upper level winds, Professor Homer T. Mantis used \"down cameras\", which photographed features on the ground.<ref name='MANTIS'/>  Ney was interested in studying variations of air temperature with altitude.<ref name='TEMP'/>  To measure them, he put [[thermistors]] and wire thermometers on many flights.<ref name='WIRE'/>  With the aid of standard [[radiosonde]] equipment, Ney's student, John L. Gergen, carried out 380 radiation temperature soundings in parallel with the balloon project.<ref name='FINAL'/>  With Leland Bohl, and Suomi, he invented and patented the \"black ball\", which is an instrument that responds not to air temperature, but to [[thermal radiation]] in the atmosphere.<ref name='BLACKBALL'/>\n\nAfter 1956, the Office of Naval Research continued to support, under Nonr-710 (22), Minnesota's research in [[atmospheric physics]].  While this grant was in force, and earlier during the balloon project,  Ney's students made major contributions, which he summarized as follows:\n\n<blockquote>John Kroening studied atmospheric small ions, invented a chemiluminescent ozone detector, and did a seminal study of atmospheric ozone. John Gergen designed the \"black ball\" and studied atmospheric radiation balance, culminating in a national series of radiation soundings in which a majority of the weather bureau stations took part. Jim Rosen studied aerosols with an optical coincidence counter, which was so good it still has not been improved; he was the first to discover thin laminar layers of dust in the stratosphere and to identify the source as volcanic eruptions. Ted Pepin participated in photographic observations from balloon platforms, and has subsequently carried this interest further with optical observations of the Earth's limb from satellites.<ref name='ACADEMY'/></blockquote>\n\n===Solar energetic particles and the IGY===\nThe International Geophysical Year (IGY) was an international scientific initiative that lasted from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958.  Because its agenda included studies of cosmic rays, Ney served on the IGY's US National Committee - Technical Panel on Cosmic Rays.<ref name='IGYPROGRAM'/>  Other members of the panel were:  [[Scott Forbush|Scott E. Forbush]] (chairman), Serge A. Korff,<ref name='KORFF'/> H. Victor Neher,<ref name='NEHER'/> [[John Alexander Simpson|J. A. Simpson]], [[Fred Singer|S. F. Singer]] and [[James Van Allen|J. A. Van Allen]].  With Winckler and Freier, Ney proposed to keep balloons aloft (nearly) continuously to monitor the intensity of cosmic rays during the period of maximum [[Solar activity variations#Other effects due to solar variation|solar activity]] that coincided with the IGY.  When this ambitious proposal was funded, Freier and Ney took responsibility for emulsion packs that went on every flight, and Winckler designed a payload that combined an [[ionization chamber]] with a [[geiger counter]].\n\nOn the first day of the IGY, this scheme paid off, when Winckler and his students, [[Laurence E. Peterson]], Roger Arnoldy and Robert Hoffman, observed [[X rays]] whose intensity followed temporal variations of an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] over Minneapolis.<ref name='AURORALX'/>  A few weeks later, Winckler and Peterson observed a brief burst of [[gamma ray]]s from a Solar Flare.<ref name='BURST'/>\n\nDuring the balloon project, Ney's research on cosmic-rays became less intense, but he continued to work with Freier and guided student work in the field.  He became more active, in anticipation of IGY, when [[Peter Fowler (physicist)|Peter Fowler]] came to Minnesota in 1956/57.  Fowler, Freier and Ney measured the intensity of Helium nuclei as a function of energy.  They found that, at high energies, the intensity exhibited a steep decrease with increasing energy, but at lower energies, it peaked and then decreased at even lower energies.  Because the peak intensity varied within the [[Solar cycle#Cosmic ray flux|solar cycle]], these measurements were an early observation of the [[Solar cycle#Cosmic ray flux|solar modulation]] of low-energy galactic cosmic rays.<ref name='FOWLER'/>\n\nAfter Fowler had returned to [[Bristol University|Bristol]], Freier, Ney and Winckler observed a very high intensity of particles on March 26, 1958, which examination of the emulsions proved were mostly low-energy protons, and which were associated with a [[Solar flare#Hazards|solar flare]].<ref name='MARCH26'/>  This was surprising, because the earth's magnetic field would normally have prevented these particles from reaching Minnesota.  Consequently, the team concluded that a [[Geomagnetic storm#Radiation hazards to humans|geomagnetic storm]], which was underway during the event, had distorted the field enough to admit protons.  Later, these influxes of [[solar energetic particles]], whose discovery was an important achievement of IGY, became designated as [[solar proton event]]s.  Along with geomagnetic storms, they are important phenomena of [[space weather]], and their intensive study continues in an effort to understand the propagation of charged particles in [[Outer space|interplanetary space]].<ref name='JOKIPII'/>\n\nAfter the IGY ended, Ney's interest in cosmic rays began to diminish, but in 1959, he wrote an often cited paper ''Cosmic Rays and the Weather'',<ref name='WEATHER'/> in which \"he was probably the first person to discuss climatological effects of cosmic rays\".<ref name='KELLETT'/>\n\n===Dim Light===\nIn 1959, Ney and his colleague Paul J. Kellogg developed a theory of the [[solar corona]] based on the idea that some of its light is [[synchrotron radiation]] emitted by energetic electrons spiraling in [[Sun#Magnetic field|solar magnetic fields]].<ref name='CORONA'/>  This theory predicted that the polarization of coronal light would exhibit a component perpendicular to that arising from [[Thomson scattering]] of sunlight, which had been widely considered to be the source of coronal luminosity.  To test this theory, Ney developed an \"eclipse polarimeter\",<ref name='POLARIMETER'/> to measure the intensity and direction of coronal polarization during a total [[solar eclipse]].  Ney and his colleagues decided to perform these measurements during the eclipse of October 2, 1959, which was visible from [[North Africa]], where there was only a small chance that clouds over the [[Sahara]] would spoil the observations.  In July, Ney went to [[French West Africa]] to set up logistical support for an expedition.  Here, a military truck, in which he was scouting locations to view the eclipse, overturned, and Ney suffered seven broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a broken leg.<ref name='MNDAILY'/>  By October, Ney had recovered enough to return to Africa, where he and his colleagues deployed three polarimeters along the track of the total eclipse.  One of these was clouded over, but the other two returned good data.  The results disproved the theory of Kellogg and Ney.<ref name='POLARIZATION'/>\n\nTo confirm and extend these observations, Ney organized an expedition to [[The Forks, Maine]] and [[Senneterre, Quebec]], where he set up two polarimeters to measure the corona during the eclipse of July 20, 1963.  In coordination with these measurements, two balloons were launched into the path of totality with cameras to record the [[zodiacal light]].  Zodiacal cameras were also launched in Australia by V. D. Hopper and J. G. Sparrow, and astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] took photographs of the corona from an aircraft at 40,000 feet over Canada.<ref name='THEFORKS'/>\n\n[[File:Lightning Photographed by Gordon Cooper.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Airglow]] and lightning over Australia; Photographed from [[Mercury-Atlas 9|Faith 7]] by [[Gordon Cooper]]]]\n\nNey's studies of the corona piqued his curiosity about other sources of dim light within the solar system.  Consequently, Ney and Huch developed reliable cameras whose low [[F-number]] enhanced their ability to record dim light, but sacrificed picture sharpness.  This compromise proved to be appropriate for the dim and diffuse [[zodiacal light]] and [[airglow]].  On May 15, 1963, aboard [[Mercury-Atlas 9|Faith 7]], one of Ney's cameras<ref name='CAMERA'/> was operated in space by [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronaut [[Gordon Cooper]].  According to Ney's student John E. Naugle, [[NASA]]'s Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, one of its images was: \".... the first photograph of the night airglow taken from above.\"<ref name='LIGHTNING'/>   NASA designated Ney's experiment as \"S-1\", which means that it was the first scientific experiment conducted on a manned space flight.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>  Later, aboard [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]s, [[Gemini 5|5]], [[Gemini 9|9]], [[Gemini 10|10]], and [[Gemini 11|11]], astronauts photographed the [[Zodiacal Light]] and the [[gegenschein]],<ref name='ZODIACAL'/> which had been obscured in the Mercury missions by [[Airglow|nightglow]].<ref name='NIGHTGLOW'/>\n\nNey followed up his zodiacal experiments on manned space missions by putting instruments aboard the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO).<ref name='SPARROW'/>  The observations showed that zodiacal light is highly polarized,<ref name='OSO2'/> and that its intensity and polarization are nearly constant in time.<ref name='OSO5'/>  The OSO instruments also recorded terrestrial lightning and demonstrated the remarkable fact that there are ten times as many flashes over the land as over the ocean.<ref name='VORPHAL'/> This difference remains unexplained.\n\n===Infrared astronomy===\nIn 1963, Ney went to  Australia on sabbatical leave, where he helped [[Robert Hanbury Brown]] and [[Richard Q. Twiss]] to construct the [[Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer]].  When he returned, Ney left behind a working instrument, but with the advice of [[Fred Hoyle]], who he met in Australia, had decided to focus his attention on a field of broader scope: [[infrared astronomy]].  His students, Wayne Stein and Fred Gillett,<ref name='GILLETT'/>  who had participated in the eclipse expeditions, were eager to work in this area.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>  At this time, there were only two infrared astronomers: [[Frank J. Low]],<ref name='OBIT_LOW'/> at the [[University of Arizona]], and [[Gerry Neugebauer]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].  To learn more, Ney and his technician, Jim Stoddart, went to Arizona's [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]], where Low, who Ney dubbed \"The Pope of infrared astronomy\", familiarized them with his newly developed low temperature [[Bolometer#Applications in astronomy|bolometer]]s.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/>  After Stein completed his Ph.D in 1964, he went to [[Princeton University]] to help Professor Robert E. Danielson,<ref name='DANIELSON'/> an earlier Ney student, carry out infrared observations on [[Stratoscope]] II.  Similarly, [[Laurence E. Peterson|Larry Peterson]] convinced Gillett to begin a program in infrared astronomy at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD).  Soon, Stein joined Gillett at UCSD.\n\nUntil Ney began his infrared studies, astronomical research at Minnesota had been carried out mainly by [[Willem Jacob Luyten|Willem Luyten]], who was an expert on [[white dwarf]] stars and is credited with coining this name in 1922.<ref name='DWARF'/>  When Luyten retired in 1967, he was replaced by Nick Woolf,<ref name='WOOLF'/> who had been involved with Stratoscope II, and whom Ney had recruited from the [[University of Texas]].  With this addition, the department's research emphasis shifted decisively to infrared astronomy, and Minnesota became a significant presence in this nascent field.\n\n===O'Brien Observatory===\nInfrared astronomy began at Minnesota under a severe competitive disadvantage: the lack of a nearby observatory.  Because infrared radiation is primarily absorbed by atmospheric water vapor, infrared observatories were typically on mountain tops, above which there is minimal water.  From his knowledge of atmospheric physics, Ney realized that, during its cold winters, the air above Minnesota was as free of water as that above a high mountain.  Armed with this insight, he approached Nancy Boggess,<ref name='BOGGESS'/> who had just taken responsibility for NASA's infrared astronomy programs, and who quickly authorized funding for a Minnesota observatory.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/>  Ney persuaded Thomond \"Tomy\" O'Brien to donate a site on the hills above [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota]], which is about 22 miles northeast of Minneapolis.<ref name='TOMY'/>   Another 180 acre parcel from the extensive holdings of Thomond's grandfather formed the nucleus of [[William O'Brien State Park]], two miles upriver from Marine.\n\nThe 30 inch [[Cassegrain reflector]], with which Ney fitted out [[O'Brien Observatory]], saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] in August 1967.  That winter, it was put to use by Ney and Stein.<ref name='OBRIEN'/>  The next winter, Woolf and Ney discovered that  [[Infrared#Astronomy|infrared radiation]] from certain cool stars exhibits a spectral feature which indicates that they are surrounded by grains of carbon and [[silicate minerals]].<ref name='SILICATES'/>  Within two years, further work by the Minnesota/UCSD group established that these grains, from which planets are formed, are ubiquitous in circumstellar winds and regions of star formation.  At O'Brien, Ney and his Australian colleague, David Allen,<ref name='ALLEN'/> carried out imaging studies of the lunar surface which revealed temperature anomalies.  To explain them, Allen and Ney suggested that large rocks in contact with deep subsurface layers cooled more slowly than the loosely packed [[Lunar soil|regolith]].<ref name='MOON'/>\n\n===Mount Lemmon observing facility===\nDespite the success of the O/Brien Observatory, the Minnesota/UCSD group realized that they needed regular access to a large infrared telescope located at a high altitude site.  Consequently, Stein, Gillett, Woolf and Ney proposed to construct a 60-inch infrared telescope.  They obtained funding from their two universities, the [[National Science Foundation]], and from Fred Hoyle, who offered a contribution with the understanding that aspiring British infrared astronomers would be trained at Minnesota.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/>  After Woolf's student, Robert Gehrz, completed a search for suitable sites, the group decided on [[Mount Lemmon]], whose proximity to a source of [[liquid helium]] at the [[University of Arizona]] greatly simplified the logistics.  The observatory was named the Mount Lemmon Observing Facility (MLOF).<ref name='MNTELESCOPES'/>  It achieved first light in December 1970.\n\n===Teaching===\nNey loved to teach.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>  In 1961 he gave the Minnesota department's first honors course in modern physics.  He wrote up his lectures as ''Ney's Notes on Relativity'', which were published as the book ''Electromagnetism and Relativity''.<ref name='ELECTROMAGNETISM'/>  In 1964, Ney received Minnesota's outstanding teaching award.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1982, Ney had a serious heart attack. It was followed by open heart surgery on November 28 of that year, which left him with [[ventricular tachycardia]] for the rest of his life.  Taking an active role in the treatment of this condition, Ney applied his knowledge of physics to the study of cardiology and of his heart's electrical system.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n\nThis illness slowed Ney down for a few years, but he eventually began to study the effect of [[radon gas]] in the atmosphere.  He thought that the ionization from radon, which comes from [[radioactive decay]] of uranium and thorium in rocks, might account for the high frequency of lightning over land, which had been demonstrated on OSO.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>  This research continued after his retirement in 1990, but did not reach a conclusion before he died on July 9, 1996.<ref name='NEYOBITUARY'/>\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n[[Frank J. Low|Frank Low]] summarized Ney's career:\n\n<blockquote>Ed Ney at Minnesota had a strong belief that being at the scientific forefront meant doing new and difficult things that few others were doing and doing them better.  He also felt that to be the best at what you do and the master of your future, you had to be able to learn how to create and advance all of the technology in your own house rather than collaborating too closely with outsiders.  Ed's eclectic interests led him in a natural progression from the Manhattan Project, to measurements of cosmic rays, to studies of the physics of balloon flight, to atmospheric and solar physics, to research on the solar corona and the zodiacal light, and finally into the world of astronomy.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/></blockquote>\n\n===Doctoral students===\nA less visible impact is that made by Ney's students after they finished their PhDs.  In 1959, John Naugle joined [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and in 1960, took charge of [[NASA|the National Aeronautical and Space Administration's]] particles and fields research program.  Later, he became associate administrator for NASA's Office of Space Science, and from 1977 until 1981, served as [[NASA Chief Scientist]].<ref name='NAUGLE'/>  Similarly, [[Frank B. McDonald|Frank McDonald]] joined Goddard in 1959 as head of the Energetic Particles Branch in the Space Science Division, where he was project scientist on nine satellite programs.  In 1982 he became NASA Chief Scientist, serving until 1987, when he returned to Goddard as associate director/chief scientist.<ref name='FRANK'/>\n\nAt [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Bob Danielson played a key role in the [[Stratoscope]] project, where he was a pioneer of [[infrared astronomy]].  James M. Rosen became a professor at the [[University of Wyoming]] Department of Physics and Astronomy, where he studied atmospheric dust and aerosols.  He was also instrumental in the founding of the [[Wyoming Infrared Observatory]], which was built by Robert Gherz and John Hackwell, another Ney student.<ref name='GEHRZ'/>\n\nIn 1973, Fred Gillett moved from UCSD to [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] where he helped to develop the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]].  His investigations on this mission revealed the \"[[Vega]] phenomenon\", which refers to dust in orbit around certain young stars.  This discovery provided the first solid evidence that planet formation occurs throughout the galaxy.  From 1987 to 1989, he was a visiting senior scientist at [[NASA headquarters]], where he played a major role in defining the future of infrared astronomy.  More specifically, he made major technical and programmatic contributions to the Space Infrared Telescope, which was renamed the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] after its launch in 2003, the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]], which consists of a large infrared telescope aboard an airplane, and [[2MASS]], which is an infrared all-sky survey.  After this administrative interlude, he went to the [[Gemini Observatory]], where he became Project Scientist.<ref name='GILLETT'/>  After Gillett's untimely death on April 22, 2001, the telescope on [[Mauna Kea]], [[Hawaii]], was officially named the ''Fredrick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope''.<ref name='GEMINI'/>\n\n===Honors and awards===\n*1964 University of Minnesota, Outstanding Teaching Award\n*1969 NASA Apollo Achievement Award<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n*1971 [[National Academy of Sciences]]\n*1974 University of Minnesota, Regent's Professorship<ref name='ACADEMY'/>\n*1975 [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]]\n*1979 [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n*1992 University of Minnesota, Outstanding Achievement Award\n\n===Advisory committee memberships===\n*1955 US Air Force, study group on biological aspects of cosmic radiation\n*1959 [[United States National Research Council]], subcommittee on nuclear emulsions\n*1960 - 1961 NASA, planetary and interplanetary subcommittee\n*1975 [[National Science Foundation]], visiting committee, astronomy section\n*1976 - 1978 [[Science (journal)|Science magazine]], editorial board\n*1976 - 1979 [[American Astronomical Society]], council\n*1979 - 1982 [[United States National Research Council|NRC]], space sciences board\n*1982 - 1985 University of Minnesota, university senate<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n\n==Selected remarks by Ney==\n<blockquote>I knew I couldn't compete with Al Nier.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Whatever you don't test will come back to haunt you.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>It was fun to get to know the astronauts, but a hard way to do science.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I went to Australia to get my merit badge in astronomy.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\nCommenting on the discovery of carbon and silicate grains around aging stars:\n\n<blockquote>In a cosmology dominated by Hydrogen and Helium, it was a relief to find a source of the material that forms the terrestrial planets.<ref name='ACADEMY'/></blockquote>\n\nOn January 19, 1953, replying to an invitation to attend the [[Bruno Rossi#Bagn.C3.A8res-de-Bigorre conference|Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre cosmic ray conference]] from [[:fr:Louis Leprince-Ringuet|Louis Leprince-Ringuet]], whom he addressed as \"petit Prince\", Ney wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I would like very much to attend the conference in the Pyrenees in July.

He pioneered the use of high altitude balloons for scientific investigations and helped to develop procedures and equipment that underlie modern scientific ballooning.  He was one of the first researchers to put experiments aboard spacecraft.\n\nIn 1963, Ney became one of the first infrared astronomers.  He founded [[O'Brien Observatory]], where he and his colleagues discovered that certain stars are surrounded by grains of carbon and [[silicate minerals]] and established that these grains, from which planets are formed, are ubiquitous in circumstellar winds and regions of star formation.\n\n== Early life==\nNey's father, Otto Fred Ney and mother, Jessamine Purdy Ney, lived in [[Waukon, Iowa]].  However, in October 1920, his mother went to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], where Ney was delivered by [[Caesarean section]].<ref name='ORAL'/>  After elementary school, he attended [[Waukon High School]], where he developed an interest in science and mathematics that was encouraged by Coach Howard B. Moffitt,<ref name='ACADEMY'/> who taught several of his courses and later became an administrator at the [[University of Iowa]].<ref name='MOFFITT'/>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1938, Ney began undergraduate studies at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he became acquainted with Professor [[Alfred O. C. Nier]], who was an expert in [[mass spectrometry]].  Soon, Nier recruited him to work in the spectroscopy laboratory for 35 cents per hour.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>  In February 1940,<ref name='NIER'/> Nier prepared a tiny but pure sample of [[Uranium-235]], which he mailed to [[Columbia University]], where [[John R. Dunning]] and his team proved that this [[isotope]] was responsible for [[nuclear fission]], rather than the more abundant [[Uranium-238]].  This finding was a crucial step in the development of the [[atomic bomb]].<ref name='NIER2'/>  That summer, Ney and Robert Thompson prepared a larger sample of Uranium-235, which provided material for further important tests.  Later, he helped Nier design and test mass spectrographs that were replicated for extensive use in the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name='ORAL'/>\n\n===Graduate studies in Virginia===\nIn June 1942, after graduating with a B.S. degree in physics, Ney married June Felsing.  They had four children: Judy, John, Arthur, and William.  That year, Ney took his bride and two of Nier's mass spectrographs to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]],<ref name='NIER2'/> where he began graduate studies with [[Jesse Beams]] at the [[University of Virginia]].  Ney brought experience and equipment that contributed significantly to Beams's wartime project to develop [[Gas centrifuges#History|gas centrifuges]] for [[Isotope separation#Centrifugal effect|separation of uranium isotopes]].<ref name='BEAMS'/>\n\nWith Beams as his thesis advisor, Ney measured the [[self-diffusion]] coefficient of [[uranium hexaflouride]].  At the time, his results were [[Classified information|classified]], but in 1947, they were published in the [[Physical Review]].<ref name='HEXAFLOURIDE'/>  In 1946, Ney received his Ph.D. in [[physics]] and became an assistant professor at the University of Virginia.  With Beams and Leland Swoddy, he began an underground [[cosmic rays|cosmic ray]] experiment in [[Endless Caverns]] near [[New Market, Virginia]]\n\n===Return to Minnesota===\nJohn T. Tate,<ref name='TATE'/> was an influential professor of physics at the [[University of Minnesota]], who was Nier's mentor<ref name='NIER2'/> and editor of the ''[[Physical Review]]''.<ref name='COMO'/>  After the war, he recognized the research potential of large plastic balloons, which had been invented by [[Jean Piccard]] and were being manufactured at the [[General Mills]] Laboratories in the [[Como, Minneapolis#Trivia|Como neighborhood]] of Minneapolis.  Here, [[Otto C. Winzen]] used polyethylene to make balloons whose performance at high altitudes was better than the [[Jean Piccard#Plastic balloons|cellophane ones developed by Piccard]].<ref name='WINZEN'/>   In 1947, because of Ney's interest in cosmic rays, Tate offered him a position as assistant professor, which was immediately accepted.<ref name='ORAL'/>  Except for a sabbatical and two brief leaves of absence, Ney spent the rest of his life at Minnesota.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>\n\n[[File:Cloud Chamber Photo of Heavy Nucleus.jpg|right|thumb|300px|At center right, a primary cosmic ray heavy nucleus goes vertically through a cloud chamber, which was suspended under a balloon near the top of the atmosphere. At left, a Helium nucleus enters through the side of the chamber. Thin tracks are singly charged particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Note that this is a negative image, in which white droplets appear black, and that the horizontal bars are electrodes that do not introduce any material into the chamber.<br>Photo provided by James A. Earl]]\n\n===Discovery of heavy cosmic ray nuclei===\nBack in Minneapolis, Ney met [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and [[Edward J. Lofgren]], who had both arrived about a year earlier.  In response to Tate's initiative, these three decided to use balloons to study primary cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere.  At first, they focused on developing [[cloud chamber]]s small enough to fly on balloons, but soon realized that [[nuclear emulsion]]s offer a more portable way to detect energetic particles.<ref name='ILFORD'/>  To take charge of emulsion work, they enlisted a graduate student, [[Phyllis S. Freier]], as the fourth member of their group.  Later, she became a renowned professor.<ref name='FREIER'/>  In 1948, the Minnesota group collaborated with Bernard Peters and Helmut L. Bradt, of the [[University of Rochester]], to launch a balloon flight carrying a cloud chamber and emulsions.  This flight gave evidence for heavy nuclei among the cosmic rays.<ref name='DISCOVERY'/>  More specifically,  the researchers discovered that, in addition to Hydrogen nuclei ([[Proton#Atomic number|protons]]), primary cosmic rays contain substantial numbers of fast moving nuclei of [[Chemical element|element]]s from [[Alpha particle|Helium]] to Iron.\n\nIn ordinary matter, [[atom]]s of these elements consist of a [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by a cloud of electrons, but when the nuclei arrive as cosmic rays, they are devoid of electrons, because of collisions with atoms in [[Interstellar medium|interstellar matter]].  In both emulsions and cloud chambers, these \"stripped\" heavy nuclei leave an unmistakable track, which is much denser and \"hairier\" than that of protons, and whose characteristics make it possible to determine their [[atomic number]].  In further flights, the group showed that the [[Abundances of the chemical elements|abundances]] of elements in cosmic rays are similar to those found on earth and in stars.<ref name='ABUNDANCE'/>  These results had a major impact, for they showed that studies of cosmic radiation could play a significant role in [[astrophysics]].\n\nShortly after these discoveries, Lofgren left for California to build the [[Bevatron]].  In 1949, Oppenheimer was forced to resign from the Minnesota faculty, because he had concealed his prewar membership in the [[Communist Party USA]].   That year, [[John R. Winckler]] joined Minnesota's cosmic ray group.<ref name='WINCKLER'/>\n\nIn 1950, with the aid of a cloud chamber that contained lead plates,  Ney, together with [[Charles Critchfield]] and graduate student Sophie Oleksa, searched for primary cosmic ray [[electrons]].<ref name='OLEKSA'/>  They did not find them, but in 1960, James Earl, who joined the Minnesota group in 1958, used similar apparatus to discover a small primary electron component.<ref name='EARL'/>\n\nDuring the decade from 1950 to 1960, Ney's cosmic ray research shifted away from cloud chambers toward emulsions.  However, his graduate students used [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett#Academia and research|counter controlled cloud chambers]] to make significant advances in electronic instrumentation for the detection and analysis of cosmic rays.  Specifically, in 1954, [[John Linsley]] used a cloud chamber triggered by a [[cherenkov detector]] to study the charge distribution of heavy nuclei,<ref name='LINSLEY'/> and in 1955, [[Frank B. McDonald|Frank McDonald]] used one triggered by a [[scintillation counter]] for a similar purpose.  Later, McDonald combined these two electronic detectors into a balloon instrument that served as a prototype for devices carried on many spacecraft.<ref name='MCDONALD'/>\n\n===Balloon technology===\n[[File:PATENT-2872808 FIG 1.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Figure 1. From a patent: ''Tension Component Measuring Means''<br>US Patent and Trademark Office]]\n\nAlthough early plastic balloons performed spectacularly in a few cases, there were dangerous mishaps during launch and many unexplained failures in flight.  Ney realized that this unreliability was due to inadequate engineering and a fundamental lack of understanding of balloon physics.  In response, he collaborated with Critchfield and Winckler to carry out a project entitled \"Research and Development in the Field of High Altitude Plastic Balloons\", which was sponsored by the US Army, Navy, and Air Force under a contract with the [[Office of Naval Research]], Nonr-710 (01), which was in force from December 1951 until August 1956.<ref name='FINAL'/>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the United States sponsored several heavily funded and top secret attempts to carry out surveillance of the [[Soviet Union]] by means of balloon overflights .  These included: [[Project Mogul]], [[Project Moby Dick]], and [[Project Genetrix]].<ref name='GENETRIX'/>  In July 1958, responding to the disappointing results of these efforts and to the deployment of the [[Lockheed U-2]], President Eisenhower ordered an end to balloon surveillance.  Because the secret programs made use of information from the Minnesota balloon project, it too was secret, but all its materials were declassified in 1958.<ref name='PROGRESS'/>\n\nWhile the project was active, Ney and his coworkers carried out 313 major or experimental balloon flights, published 16 technical reports,<ref name='PROGRESS'/> and patented approximately 20 inventions.<ref name='PATENTS'/>  The final report lists 62 major innovations and achievements.<ref name='FINAL'/>  The innovations include the duct appendix,<ref name='DUCT'/> the natural shape balloon,<ref name='NATURAL'/> the Minnesota launch system,<ref name='LAUNCH'/> and the tetroon balloon design.<ref name='TETROON'/>  The last achievement listed was the post-project flight of a [[BoPET|mylar]] tetroon on September 7, 1956, which reached a maximum height of 145,000 feet (44,000 m) over Minneapolis.  At the time, this was a record altitude for balloons, and there was considerable press coverage of the flight.<ref name='RECORD'/>  Most of the project's balloons were launched at the University of Minnesota Airport in [[New Brighton, Minnesota]].<ref name='AIRPORT'/>  They were among more than 1000 flights launched here from 1948 until the airport was devastated by a tornado on May 6, 1965.<ref name='TORNADO'/>\n\nKey personnel of the project were:  Raymond W. Maas and William F. Huch, who provided engineering expertise, Rudolph B. Thorness, who was in charge of the physics machine shop, Robert L. Howard, who ran the electronics shop, and Leland S. Bohl,<ref name='BOHl'/> who worked on the project while earning his Ph.D. under Ney.<ref name='FINAL'/>  Many of their names appear as authors not only of patents<ref name='NATURAL'/> and technical reports,<ref name='PROGRESS'/> but also of scientific publications.<ref name='TEMP'/>\n\nIn spite of its secrecy, many of the project's balloons carried instruments for open scientific research.  For example, from January 20, 1953,  until February 4, 1953, with [[Winzen Research]], Inc, the project launched 13 flights at [[Pyote Air Force Base]] in Texas.<ref name='PYOTE'/>  Several of these carried packages for cosmic ray research, one of which was designated as \"ballast\".  These were [[Skyhook balloon|Skyhook]] flights, which is the generic term used by the Office of Naval Research to designate balloon flights whose primary objectives were scientific, rather than military.  Some milestones of more than 1500 Skyhook flights are: the first Skyhook launch (1947), the first shipboard launch (1949), the [[Rockoon]] program (1952), the tetroon record flight of September 1956, [[Stratoscope]] (1957 - 1971), and Skyhook [[Churchill Airport|Churchill]] (1959 - 1976).<ref name='CHURCHILL'/>\n\nIn 1960, the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] was established.  On October 17, 1961, its panel on scientific balloons met to select a permanent launch site for balloon operations.  Members of this panel, whose chairman was [[Verner E. Suomi]], were Ney, [[Charles B. Moore]], Alvin Howell,<ref name='HOWELL'/> James K. Angell,<ref name='ANGELL'/> [[J. Allen Hynek]], and [[Martin Schwarzschild]],<ref name='TRIMBLE'/> who was the prime mover behind Stratoscope. They chose [[Palestine, Texas]], where the [[National Scientific Balloon Facility]] (NSBF) was created in 1962.  Since then, thousands of balloons have been launched there, and it has served as the base for flight expeditions all over the world.<ref name='NSBF'/>\n\nThe Minnesota balloon project pioneered procedures and equipment used in Skyhook, NSBF, and the manned flights of Projects [[Project Strato-Lab|Stratolab]] and [[Project Manhigh|Manhigh]].  These include launch methods, design of reliable balloons, knowledge of [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] structure, and reliable instrumentation for flight control and tracking.\n\n===Atmospheric physics===\nDuring the balloon project, winds and temperatures in the atmosphere were prime subjects for investigation, for they have a critical impact on balloon performance.  To map out upper level winds, Professor Homer T. Mantis used \"down cameras\", which photographed features on the ground.<ref name='MANTIS'/>  Ney was interested in studying variations of air temperature with altitude.<ref name='TEMP'/>  To measure them, he put [[thermistors]] and wire thermometers on many flights.<ref name='WIRE'/>  With the aid of standard [[radiosonde]] equipment, Ney's student, John L. Gergen, carried out 380 radiation temperature soundings in parallel with the balloon project.<ref name='FINAL'/>  With Leland Bohl, and Suomi, he invented and patented the \"black ball\", which is an instrument that responds not to air temperature, but to [[thermal radiation]] in the atmosphere.<ref name='BLACKBALL'/>\n\nAfter 1956, the Office of Naval Research continued to support, under Nonr-710 (22), Minnesota's research in [[atmospheric physics]].  While this grant was in force, and earlier during the balloon project,  Ney's students made major contributions, which he summarized as follows:\n\n<blockquote>John Kroening studied atmospheric small ions, invented a chemiluminescent ozone detector, and did a seminal study of atmospheric ozone. John Gergen designed the \"black ball\" and studied atmospheric radiation balance, culminating in a national series of radiation soundings in which a majority of the weather bureau stations took part. Jim Rosen studied aerosols with an optical coincidence counter, which was so good it still has not been improved; he was the first to discover thin laminar layers of dust in the stratosphere and to identify the source as volcanic eruptions. Ted Pepin participated in photographic observations from balloon platforms, and has subsequently carried this interest further with optical observations of the Earth's limb from satellites.<ref name='ACADEMY'/></blockquote>\n\n===Solar energetic particles and the IGY===\nThe International Geophysical Year (IGY) was an international scientific initiative that lasted from July 1, 1957, to December 31, 1958.  Because its agenda included studies of cosmic rays, Ney served on the IGY's US National Committee - Technical Panel on Cosmic Rays.<ref name='IGYPROGRAM'/>  Other members of the panel were:  [[Scott Forbush|Scott E. Forbush]] (chairman), Serge A. Korff,<ref name='KORFF'/> H. Victor Neher,<ref name='NEHER'/> [[John Alexander Simpson|J. A. Simpson]], [[Fred Singer|S. F. Singer]] and [[James Van Allen|J. A. Van Allen]].  With Winckler and Freier, Ney proposed to keep balloons aloft (nearly) continuously to monitor the intensity of cosmic rays during the period of maximum [[Solar activity variations#Other effects due to solar variation|solar activity]] that coincided with the IGY.  When this ambitious proposal was funded, Freier and Ney took responsibility for emulsion packs that went on every flight, and Winckler designed a payload that combined an [[ionization chamber]] with a [[geiger counter]].\n\nOn the first day of the IGY, this scheme paid off, when Winckler and his students, [[Laurence E. Peterson]], Roger Arnoldy and Robert Hoffman, observed [[X rays]] whose intensity followed temporal variations of an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] over Minneapolis.<ref name='AURORALX'/>  A few weeks later, Winckler and Peterson observed a brief burst of [[gamma ray]]s from a Solar Flare.<ref name='BURST'/>\n\nDuring the balloon project, Ney's research on cosmic-rays became less intense, but he continued to work with Freier and guided student work in the field.  He became more active, in anticipation of IGY, when [[Peter Fowler (physicist)|Peter Fowler]] came to Minnesota in 1956/57.  Fowler, Freier and Ney measured the intensity of Helium nuclei as a function of energy.  They found that, at high energies, the intensity exhibited a steep decrease with increasing energy, but at lower energies, it peaked and then decreased at even lower energies.  Because the peak intensity varied within the [[Solar cycle#Cosmic ray flux|solar cycle]], these measurements were an early observation of the [[Solar cycle#Cosmic ray flux|solar modulation]] of low-energy galactic cosmic rays.<ref name='FOWLER'/>\n\nAfter Fowler had returned to [[Bristol University|Bristol]], Freier, Ney and Winckler observed a very high intensity of particles on March 26, 1958, which examination of the emulsions proved were mostly low-energy protons, and which were associated with a [[Solar flare#Hazards|solar flare]].<ref name='MARCH26'/>  This was surprising, because the earth's magnetic field would normally have prevented these particles from reaching Minnesota.  Consequently, the team concluded that a [[Geomagnetic storm#Radiation hazards to humans|geomagnetic storm]], which was underway during the event, had distorted the field enough to admit protons.  Later, these influxes of [[solar energetic particles]], whose discovery was an important achievement of IGY, became designated as [[solar proton event]]s.  Along with geomagnetic storms, they are important phenomena of [[space weather]], and their intensive study continues in an effort to understand the propagation of charged particles in [[Outer space|interplanetary space]].<ref name='JOKIPII'/>\n\nAfter the IGY ended, Ney's interest in cosmic rays began to diminish, but in 1959, he wrote an often cited paper ''Cosmic Rays and the Weather'',<ref name='WEATHER'/> in which \"he was probably the first person to discuss climatological effects of cosmic rays\".<ref name='KELLETT'/>\n\n===Dim Light===\nIn 1959, Ney and his colleague Paul J. Kellogg developed a theory of the [[corona|solar corona]] based on the idea that some of its light is [[synchrotron radiation]] emitted by energetic electrons spiraling in [[Sun#Magnetic field|solar magnetic fields]].<ref name='CORONA'/>  This theory predicted that the polarization of coronal light would exhibit a component perpendicular to that arising from [[Thomson scattering]] of sunlight, which had been widely considered to be the source of coronal luminosity.  To test this theory, Ney developed an \"eclipse polarimeter\",<ref name='POLARIMETER'/> to measure the intensity and direction of coronal polarization during a total [[solar eclipse]].  Ney and his colleagues decided to perform these measurements during the eclipse of October 2, 1959, which was visible from [[North Africa]], where there was only a small chance that clouds over the [[Sahara]] would spoil the observations.  In July, Ney went to [[French West Africa]] to set up logistical support for an expedition.  Here, a military truck, in which he was scouting locations to view the eclipse, overturned, and Ney suffered seven broken ribs, a broken collarbone and a broken leg.<ref name='MNDAILY'/>  By October, Ney had recovered enough to return to Africa, where he and his colleagues deployed three polarimeters along the track of the total eclipse.  One of these was clouded over, but the other two returned good data.  The results disproved the theory of Kellogg and Ney.<ref name='POLARIZATION'/>\n\nTo confirm and extend these observations, Ney organized an expedition to [[The Forks, Maine]] and [[Senneterre, Quebec]], where he set up two polarimeters to measure the corona during the eclipse of July 20, 1963.  In coordination with these measurements, two balloons were launched into the path of totality with cameras to record the [[zodiacal light]].  Zodiacal cameras were also launched in Australia by V. D. Hopper and J. G. Sparrow, and astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]] took photographs of the corona from an aircraft at 40,000 feet over Canada.<ref name='THEFORKS'/>\n\n[[File:Lightning Photographed by Gordon Cooper.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Airglow]] and lightning over Australia; Photographed from [[Mercury-Atlas 9|Faith 7]] by [[Gordon Cooper]]]]\n\nNey's studies of the corona piqued his curiosity about other sources of dim light within the solar system.  Consequently, Ney and Huch developed reliable cameras whose low [[F-number]] enhanced their ability to record dim light, but sacrificed picture sharpness.  This compromise proved to be appropriate for the dim and diffuse [[zodiacal light]] and [[airglow]].  On May 15, 1963, aboard [[Mercury-Atlas 9|Faith 7]], one of Ney's cameras<ref name='CAMERA'/> was operated in space by [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronaut [[Gordon Cooper]].  According to Ney's student John E. Naugle, [[NASA]]'s Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, one of its images was: \".... the first photograph of the night airglow taken from above.\"<ref name='LIGHTNING'/>   NASA designated Ney's experiment as \"S-1\", which means that it was the first scientific experiment conducted on a manned space flight.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>  Later, aboard [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]s, [[Gemini 5|5]], [[Gemini 9|9]], [[Gemini 10|10]], and [[Gemini 11|11]], astronauts photographed the [[Zodiacal Light]] and the [[gegenschein]],<ref name='ZODIACAL'/> which had been obscured in the Mercury missions by [[Airglow|nightglow]].<ref name='NIGHTGLOW'/>\n\nNey followed up his zodiacal experiments on manned space missions by putting instruments aboard the [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] (OSO).<ref name='SPARROW'/>  The observations showed that zodiacal light is highly polarized,<ref name='OSO2'/> and that its intensity and polarization are nearly constant in time.<ref name='OSO5'/>  The OSO instruments also recorded terrestrial lightning and demonstrated the remarkable fact that there are ten times as many flashes over the land as over the ocean.<ref name='VORPHAL'/> This difference remains unexplained.\n\n===Infrared astronomy===\nIn 1963, Ney went to  Australia on sabbatical leave, where he helped [[Robert Hanbury Brown]] and [[Richard Q. Twiss]] to construct the [[Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer]].  When he returned, Ney left behind a working instrument, but with the advice of [[Fred Hoyle]], who he met in Australia, had decided to focus his attention on a field of broader scope: [[infrared astronomy]].  His students, Wayne Stein and Fred Gillett,<ref name='GILLETT'/>  who had participated in the eclipse expeditions, were eager to work in this area.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>  At this time, there were only two infrared astronomers: [[Frank J. Low]],<ref name='OBIT_LOW'/> at the [[University of Arizona]], and [[Gerry Neugebauer]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].  To learn more, Ney and his technician, Jim Stoddart, went to Arizona's [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]], where Low, who Ney dubbed \"The Pope of infrared astronomy\", familiarized them with his newly developed low temperature [[Bolometer#Applications in astronomy|bolometer]]s.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/>  After Stein completed his Ph.D in 1964, he went to [[Princeton University]] to help Professor Robert E. Danielson,<ref name='DANIELSON'/> an earlier Ney student, carry out infrared observations on [[Stratoscope]] II.  Similarly, [[Laurence E. Peterson|Larry Peterson]] convinced Gillett to begin a program in infrared astronomy at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD).  Soon, Stein joined Gillett at UCSD.\n\nUntil Ney began his infrared studies, astronomical research at Minnesota had been carried out mainly by [[Willem Jacob Luyten|Willem Luyten]], who was an expert on [[white dwarf]] stars and is credited with coining this name in 1922.<ref name='DWARF'/>  When Luyten retired in 1967, he was replaced by Nick Woolf,<ref name='WOOLF'/> who had been involved with Stratoscope II, and whom Ney had recruited from the [[University of Texas]].  With this addition, the department's research emphasis shifted decisively to infrared astronomy, and Minnesota became a significant presence in this nascent field.\n\n===O'Brien Observatory===\nInfrared astronomy began at Minnesota under a severe competitive disadvantage: the lack of a nearby observatory.  Because infrared radiation is primarily absorbed by atmospheric water vapor, infrared observatories were typically on mountain tops, above which there is minimal water.  From his knowledge of atmospheric physics, Ney realized that, during its cold winters, the air above Minnesota was as free of water as that above a high mountain.  Armed with this insight, he approached Nancy Boggess,<ref name='BOGGESS'/> who had just taken responsibility for NASA's infrared astronomy programs, and who quickly authorized funding for a Minnesota observatory.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/>  Ney persuaded Thomond \"Tomy\" O'Brien to donate a site on the hills above [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota]], which is about 22 miles northeast of Minneapolis.<ref name='TOMY'/>   Another 180 acre parcel from the extensive holdings of Thomond's grandfather formed the nucleus of [[William O'Brien State Park]], two miles upriver from Marine.\n\nThe 30 inch [[Cassegrain reflector]], with which Ney fitted out [[O'Brien Observatory]], saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] in August 1967.  That winter, it was put to use by Ney and Stein.<ref name='OBRIEN'/>  The next winter, Woolf and Ney discovered that  [[Infrared#Astronomy|infrared radiation]] from certain cool stars exhibits a spectral feature which indicates that they are surrounded by grains of carbon and [[silicate minerals]].<ref name='SILICATES'/>  Within two years, further work by the Minnesota/UCSD group established that these grains, from which planets are formed, are ubiquitous in circumstellar winds and regions of star formation.  At O'Brien, Ney and his Australian colleague, David Allen,<ref name='ALLEN'/> carried out imaging studies of the lunar surface which revealed temperature anomalies.  To explain them, Allen and Ney suggested that large rocks in contact with deep subsurface layers cooled more slowly than the loosely packed [[Lunar soil|regolith]].<ref name='MOON'/>\n\n===Mount Lemmon observing facility===\nDespite the success of the O/Brien Observatory, the Minnesota/UCSD group realized that they needed regular access to a large infrared telescope located at a high altitude site.  Consequently, Stein, Gillett, Woolf and Ney proposed to construct a 60-inch infrared telescope.  They obtained funding from their two universities, the [[National Science Foundation]], and from Fred Hoyle, who offered a contribution with the understanding that aspiring British infrared astronomers would be trained at Minnesota.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/>  After Woolf's student, Robert Gehrz, completed a search for suitable sites, the group decided on [[Mount Lemmon]], whose proximity to a source of [[liquid helium]] at the [[University of Arizona]] greatly simplified the logistics.  The observatory was named the Mount Lemmon Observing Facility (MLOF).<ref name='MNTELESCOPES'/>  It achieved first light in December 1970.\n\n===Teaching===\nNey loved to teach.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>  In 1961 he gave the Minnesota department's first honors course in modern physics.  He wrote up his lectures as ''Ney's Notes on Relativity'', which were published as the book ''Electromagnetism and Relativity''.<ref name='ELECTROMAGNETISM'/>  In 1964, Ney received Minnesota's outstanding teaching award.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1982, Ney had a serious heart attack. It was followed by open heart surgery on November 28 of that year, which left him with [[ventricular tachycardia]] for the rest of his life.  Taking an active role in the treatment of this condition, Ney applied his knowledge of physics to the study of cardiology and of his heart's electrical system.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n\nThis illness slowed Ney down for a few years, but he eventually began to study the effect of [[radon gas]] in the atmosphere.  He thought that the ionization from radon, which comes from [[radioactive decay]] of uranium and thorium in rocks, might account for the high frequency of lightning over land, which had been demonstrated on OSO.<ref name='ACADEMY'/>  This research continued after his retirement in 1990, but did not reach a conclusion before he died on July 9, 1996.<ref name='NEYOBITUARY'/>\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n[[Frank J. Low|Frank Low]] summarized Ney's career:\n\n<blockquote>Ed Ney at Minnesota had a strong belief that being at the scientific forefront meant doing new and difficult things that few others were doing and doing them better.  He also felt that to be the best at what you do and the master of your future, you had to be able to learn how to create and advance all of the technology in your own house rather than collaborating too closely with outsiders.  Ed's eclectic interests led him in a natural progression from the Manhattan Project, to measurements of cosmic rays, to studies of the physics of balloon flight, to atmospheric and solar physics, to research on the solar corona and the zodiacal light, and finally into the world of astronomy.<ref name='HISTORY_LOW'/></blockquote>\n\n===Doctoral students===\nA less visible impact is that made by Ney's students after they finished their PhDs.  In 1959, John Naugle joined [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and in 1960, took charge of [[NASA|the National Aeronautical and Space Administration's]] particles and fields research program.  Later, he became associate administrator for NASA's Office of Space Science, and from 1977 until 1981, served as [[NASA Chief Scientist]].<ref name='NAUGLE'/>  Similarly, [[Frank B. McDonald|Frank McDonald]] joined Goddard in 1959 as head of the Energetic Particles Branch in the Space Science Division, where he was project scientist on nine satellite programs.  In 1982 he became NASA Chief Scientist, serving until 1987, when he returned to Goddard as associate director/chief scientist.<ref name='FRANK'/>\n\nAt [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Bob Danielson played a key role in the [[Stratoscope]] project, where he was a pioneer of [[infrared astronomy]].  James M. Rosen became a professor at the [[University of Wyoming]] Department of Physics and Astronomy, where he studied atmospheric dust and aerosols.  He was also instrumental in the founding of the [[Wyoming Infrared Observatory]], which was built by Robert Gherz and John Hackwell, another Ney student.<ref name='GEHRZ'/>\n\nIn 1973, Fred Gillett moved from UCSD to [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] where he helped to develop the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite]].  His investigations on this mission revealed the \"[[Vega]] phenomenon\", which refers to dust in orbit around certain young stars.  This discovery provided the first solid evidence that planet formation occurs throughout the galaxy.  From 1987 to 1989, he was a visiting senior scientist at [[NASA headquarters]], where he played a major role in defining the future of infrared astronomy.  More specifically, he made major technical and programmatic contributions to the Space Infrared Telescope, which was renamed the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] after its launch in 2003, the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]], which consists of a large infrared telescope aboard an airplane, and [[2MASS]], which is an infrared all-sky survey.  After this administrative interlude, he went to the [[Gemini Observatory]], where he became Project Scientist.<ref name='GILLETT'/>  After Gillett's untimely death on April 22, 2001, the telescope on [[Mauna Kea]], [[Hawaii]], was officially named the ''Fredrick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope''.<ref name='GEMINI'/>\n\n===Honors and awards===\n*1964 University of Minnesota, Outstanding Teaching Award\n*1969 NASA Apollo Achievement Award<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n*1971 [[National Academy of Sciences]]\n*1974 University of Minnesota, Regent's Professorship<ref name='ACADEMY'/>\n*1975 [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]]\n*1979 [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n*1992 University of Minnesota, Outstanding Achievement Award\n\n===Advisory committee memberships===\n*1955 US Air Force, study group on biological aspects of cosmic radiation\n*1959 [[United States National Research Council]], subcommittee on nuclear emulsions\n*1960 - 1961 NASA, planetary and interplanetary subcommittee\n*1975 [[National Science Foundation]], visiting committee, astronomy section\n*1976 - 1978 [[Science (journal)|Science magazine]], editorial board\n*1976 - 1979 [[American Astronomical Society]], council\n*1979 - 1982 [[United States National Research Council|NRC]], space sciences board\n*1982 - 1985 University of Minnesota, university senate<ref name='ARCHIVES'/>\n\n==Selected remarks by Ney==\n<blockquote>I knew I couldn't compete with Al Nier.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Whatever you don't test will come back to haunt you.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>It was fun to get to know the astronauts, but a hard way to do science.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I went to Australia to get my merit badge in astronomy.<ref name='ARCHIVES'/></blockquote>\n\nCommenting on the discovery of carbon and silicate grains around aging stars:\n\n<blockquote>In a cosmology dominated by Hydrogen and Helium, it was a relief to find a source of the material that forms the terrestrial planets.<ref name='ACADEMY'/></blockquote>\n\nOn January 19, 1953, replying to an invitation to attend the [[Bruno Rossi#Bagn.C3.A8res-de-Bigorre conference|Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre cosmic ray conference]] from [[:fr:Louis Leprince-Ringuet|Louis Leprince-Ringuet]], whom he addressed as \"petit Prince\", Ney wrote:\n\n<blockquote>I would like very much to attend the conference in the Pyrenees in July.

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft\u2019s writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery. The absence of malt and hops and barley did not at all embarrass those stout-hearted settlers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Duluth and St. Louis County Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DeTGZQETyxIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=true|access-date=July 23, 2017|last1 = Woodbridge|first1 = Dwight Edwards|last2 = Pardee|first2 = John Stone|year = 1910}}</ref> The water for brewing was obtained from a stream that emptied into Lake Superior that came to be called Brewery Creek, as it is still known today.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited. However, lumber is cheap and shanties can be built.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

Although steel production did not begin until 1915, predictions held that Duluth's population would rise to 200,000\u2013300,000. Along with the [[Duluth Works]] steel plant, US Steel developed [[Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota|Morgan Park]], as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.\n\nThe [[Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company]] was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools. Duluth's huge wholesale Marshall Wells Hardware Company expanded in 1901 by opening branches in [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]; the company catalog totaled 2,390 pages by 1913. The Duluth Showcase Company, which later became the Duluth Refrigerator Company and then the Coolerator Company, was established in 1908. The Universal Atlas Cement Company, which made cement from the slag byproduct of the steel plant, began operations in 1917.\n\n====Immigration====\nBecause of its numerous jobs in mining and industry, the city was a destination for large waves of immigrants from Europe during the early 20th century.

From 1907 to 1941, the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] and then the IWW operated [[Work People's College]], an educational institution that taught classes from a working-class, socialist perspective. \nImmigrants from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, England, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia also settled in Duluth.<ref name=\"Port of Duluth\" /> Today, people of Scandinavian descent constitute a strong plurality of Duluth's population, accounting for more than one third of the residents identifying European ancestry.\n\n====Duluth lynchings====\n[[File:Clayton-Jackson-McGhie-memorial-Duluth-Minnesota.jpg|thumb|left|[[Duluth lynchings]] memorial]]\n\nIn September 1918, at the beginning of U.S. involvement in the [[World War I|Great War]], a group calling itself the Knights of Liberty dragged Finnish immigrant [[Olli Kinkkonen]] from his boarding house, tarred and feathered him, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] him.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with vessel approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

Duluth has been called \"the San Francisco of the Midwest,\" alluding to [[San Francisco]]'s similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The [[weather station]] at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).<ref name=wunderground>{{cite web|title=Duluth, Minnesota|publisher=The Weather Underground, Inc.

Duluth and Lake Superior coast are visible at far left]]\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, so Duluth is primarily a southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:Large anorthosite xenolith in ophitic ilmenite gabbro (anorthosite series, Duluth Complex, Mesoproterozoic, 1099 Ma; Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) 1 (22039818790).jpg|thumb|Large [[anorthosite]] [[xenolith]] in ophitic ilmenite gabbro, Duluth Complex, Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota]]\n[[File:Agat Lake Superior - Duluth, Minnesota, USA..jpg|thumb|[[Lake Superior agate]] - Duluth, Minnesota]]\n\nThe geology of Duluth demonstrates the [[Midcontinent Rift]], formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior.

Great local variations are also common because of the rapid change in elevation between the nearly 900-foot hilltop and shoreside. Often this variation manifests itself as snow at the Miller Hill Mall while rain falls in Canal Park.<ref name=\"superior\" />\n\nThe record low temperature in Duluth is {{convert|-41|\u00b0F}}, set on January 2, 1885, and the record high temperature is {{convert|106|\u00b0F}}, set on July 13, 1936.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city. Mayor Don Ness called it \"the single most important volunteer effort in our city\u2019s history.\" After reforming and restructuring the benefits and a court case that went all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, in 2013 the liability stood at an estimated $191 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/business/yourmoney/11retire.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Milt | last1=Freudenheim | title=The Next Retirement Time Bomb | date=December 11, 2005}}</ref> In 2014, the mayor announced \"a full solution for the retiree health care issue that once threatened to bankrupt our city.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth mayor touts plan for retiree health care|url=http://www.twincities.com/2014/10/07/duluth-mayor-touts-plan-for-retiree-health-care/|access-date=April 23, 2017|publisher=Pioneer Press|date=October 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424085535/http://www.twincities.com/2014/10/07/duluth-mayor-touts-plan-for-retiree-health-care/|archive-date=April 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Largest Employers in Duluth (2005)\n|-\n!

Yearly festivals include the Bayfront Blues Festival, held in Bayfront Festival Park.\n\n====Glensheen Mansion====\n[[File:Glensheen Mansion.jpg|thumb|[[Glensheen Mansion]]]]\n\nThe [[Glensheen Historic Estate]], on the shore of Lake Superior, was built as the family home for wealthy businessman [[Chester Adgate Congdon]]. Glensheen sits on {{convert|7.6|acre}} of lakefront property, has 38 rooms and is built in the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] architectural tradition, inspired by the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] styles of the era. The building was designed by Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston Sr.]], with interiors designed by William French. The formal terraced garden and English-style landscape was designed by the [[Charles Wellford Leavitt]] firm of New York. Construction began in 1905 at a cost of $854,000 (about $21 million in today's dollars), and was completed in 1908. Aside from its architectural significance, Glensheen is noteworthy for the murders of [[Elisabeth Congdon]] and her nurse on June 27, 1977. The mansion is open to tours year-round.\n\n====Duluth Children's Museum====\nFounded in 1930, the Duluth Children's Museum in the Lincoln Park neighborhood is the fifth-oldest of its kind in the United States. It features interactive exhibits, educational programs, and opportunities for creative play designed for children, their families and caregivers, and school field trips. The museum also curates an artifact collection of over 25,000 objects drawn from the lives and cultures of people who have resided in the region, particularly American Indians and immigrants.\n\n====Christmas City of the North Parade====\nEach year in November, the Christmas City of the North Parade takes place in Duluth. The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs, using their voices to entertain the crowd. Recorded by [[Merv Griffin]] in 1962, the \"Christmas City\" song is the parade's signature sound. According to Rich's grandson, the song was written by a local resident and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin, at that time not the well-known TV personality he later became, if he would sing the song and put it to music.<ref>[http://christmascityparade.com/ Christmas City of the North Parade:<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072214/http://christmascityparade.com/ |date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ Grandson of Christmas City Parade Creator Shares History | Christmas City of the North Parade<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902015321/http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ |date=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Sports==\n<div style=\"float:right; margin:0 1em 1em 0\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Duluth in the [[National Football League|NFL]]\n|-\n!

The Dukes were a farm team for the Detroit Tigers from 1960 to 1964 and several other teams in later years before the Northern League folded in 1971. The Dukes produced notable players such as Denny McLain, Bill Freehan, Gates Brown, Ray Oyler, Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley, John Hiller, and Willie Horton, all of whom were members of the 1968 world champion Detroit Tigers.\n\nDuluth is also home to Horton's Gym, the home gym of professional [[Boxing|boxers]] [[Zach Walters|Zach \"Jungle Boy\" Walters]] and [[Andy Kolle]], as well as a number of other professional prizefighters. Horton's Gym was run by Chuck Horton from 1994 to 2011. During that time, Horton trained some of the most recognized professional and amateur boxers in Minnesota such as Walters, Kolle, RJ Lasse, Gary Eyer and Wayne Putnam. In 2011, Horton turned the gym over to Zach Walters so that Horton could concentrate solely on training professional boxers; Walters changed the gym's name to Jungle Boy Boxing Gym.

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

All of the stores were located within the interior of the mall with some shops being accessible from both inside and out. The first floor had a pharmacy and a department store with groceries, a butcher shop, clothing, hardware, furniture, and a general store. The second floor had a bank, dentist office, barber shop, hair salon, hat shop, billiard room, and auditorium.

But Charles Watson Townsend's 1936 ''New York Times'' obituary claimed that he was the inventor, and a controversy developed. A ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' reporter read Townsend's obituary and realized that the ''Times'' had incorrectly attributed the invention to Townsend. Wanting to set the record straight, on May 23, 1936, the ''Pioneer Press'' ran a story about how the dessert was really invented at a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth in the 1880s, and indicated that the restaurant served ice cream with blueberry pie specifically. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie \u00e0 la Mode.<ref>''The New York Times'', May 21, 1936, pg.23, Charles W.

A [[Duluth pack]] is a traditional [[portage]] pack used in canoe travel. A specialized type of backpack, Duluth packs are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier. Arriving in Duluth in 1870 with a small stock of leather and tools, he began a shoe store and quickly made a go of it in what was then a booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]].

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft\u2019s writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery. The absence of malt and hops and barley did not at all embarrass those stout-hearted settlers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Duluth and St. Louis County Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DeTGZQETyxIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=true|access-date=July 23, 2017|last1 = Woodbridge|first1 = Dwight Edwards|last2 = Pardee|first2 = John Stone|year = 1910}}</ref> The water for brewing was obtained from a stream that emptied into Lake Superior that came to be called Brewery Creek, as it is still known today.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

His speech opposing the St. Croix and Superior Land Grant lampooned Western [[boosterism]], portraying Duluth as an Eden in fantastically florid terms.

Along with the [[Duluth Works]] steel plant, US Steel developed [[Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota|Morgan Park]], as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.\n\nThe [[Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company]] was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

The fire was the worst natural disaster in Minnesota history in terms of the number of lives lost in a single day. Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with vessel approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in Lincoln Park, an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

Duluth has been called \"the San Francisco of the Midwest,\" alluding to [[San Francisco]]'s similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The [[weather station]] at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).<ref name=wunderground>{{cite web|title=Duluth, Minnesota|publisher=The Weather Underground, Inc.

Duluth and Lake Superior coast are visible at far left]]\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, so Duluth is primarily a southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:Large anorthosite xenolith in ophitic ilmenite gabbro (anorthosite series, Duluth Complex, Mesoproterozoic, 1099 Ma; Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) 1 (22039818790).jpg|thumb|Large [[anorthosite]] [[xenolith]] in ophitic ilmenite gabbro, Duluth Complex, Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota]]\n[[File:Agat Lake Superior - Duluth, Minnesota, USA..jpg|thumb|[[Lake Superior agate]] - Duluth, Minnesota]]\n\nThe geology of Duluth demonstrates the [[Midcontinent Rift]], formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city.

Not a commercial success, the flights ended later that summer when the designer of the aircraft's engine crashed it. After being purchased and used for scheduled flights in Florida, the plane returned to Duluth and other locations for passenger flights in 1914, until it was ultimately damaged in a hard landing later that year in California and pronounced unsalvageable.

It is largely a conversion of an old [[warehouse district]] into restaurants, caf\u00e9s, hotels, and shops, especially those dealing in antiques and other novelties. This conversion began in the 1980s as an attempt to use Duluth's rich [[industry|industrial]] past, the decline of which had left the city in economic turmoil. A 4.2-mile lakewalk cuts through the area, offering a view of Park Point's extensive sandy dunes and beaches. Swimming is an option, though few are willing to swim in Lake Superior's icy waters. Visitors can also view the [[lighthouse]] pier, and visit the [[Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center]], the [[Great Lakes Aquarium]], and the [[William A. Irvin]] floating ship museum. Yearly festivals include the Bayfront Blues Festival, held in Bayfront Festival Park.\n\n====Glensheen Mansion====\n[[File:Glensheen Mansion.jpg|thumb|[[Glensheen Mansion]]]]\n\nThe [[Glensheen Historic Estate]], on the shore of Lake Superior, was built as the family home for wealthy businessman [[Chester Adgate Congdon]].

The building was designed by Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston Sr.]], with interiors designed by William French. The formal terraced garden and English-style landscape was designed by the [[Charles Wellford Leavitt]] firm of New York. Construction began in 1905 at a cost of $854,000 (about $21 million in today's dollars), and was completed in 1908. Aside from its architectural significance, Glensheen is noteworthy for the murders of [[Elisabeth Congdon]] and her nurse on June 27, 1977. The mansion is open to tours year-round.\n\n====Duluth Children's Museum====\nFounded in 1930, the Duluth Children's Museum in the Lincoln Park neighborhood is the fifth-oldest of its kind in the United States. It features interactive exhibits, educational programs, and opportunities for creative play designed for children, their families and caregivers, and school field trips. The museum also curates an artifact collection of over 25,000 objects drawn from the lives and cultures of people who have resided in the region, particularly American Indians and immigrants.\n\n====Christmas City of the North Parade====\nEach year in November, the Christmas City of the North Parade takes place in Duluth. The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold.

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

A [[Duluth pack]] is a traditional [[portage]] pack used in canoe travel. A specialized type of backpack, Duluth packs are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier. Arriving in Duluth in 1870 with a small stock of leather and tools, he began a shoe store and quickly made a go of it in what was then a booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]]. Although not the first elevator, the design was important for improving the method of opening and closing elevator doors, as well as closing the opening to the elevator shaft when an elevator was between floors. At that time, elevator patrons or operators were required to manually shut a door to cut off access to the shaft, and Miles created an automatic mechanism that closed that access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_Alexander_Miles.htm|title=How Black Inventor Alexander Miles Improved Elevator Safety|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===First whole-plane parachute system on a certified aircraft===\n\n{{Main|Cirrus Airframe Parachute System}}\n[[File:Caps deploy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Cirrus Airframe Parachute System]] deployment (1998)]]\n \t\t \t\nIn association with southern Minnesota company [[Ballistic Recovery Systems]] (BRS), Duluth-based aircraft manufacturing company [[Cirrus Aircraft]] developed the [[Cirrus Airframe Parachute System]] (CAPS), the first whole-plane, emergency parachute recovery system to be installed on a line of [[type certification|type certified]] aircraft, the [[Cirrus SR20]] and [[Cirrus SR22|SR22]].<ref name=TheAtlantic/> A [[solid-fuel rocket]] housed in the [[fuselage]] is used to pull the parachute out from its housing and deploy the canopy full within seconds.
