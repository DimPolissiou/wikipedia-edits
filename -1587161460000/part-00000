It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.<ref>Hammond, 1956, pp. 9\u201310</ref>}} \n  \nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 153</ref> \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:United States Bank Philadelphia 1875.png|thumb|The building in a book published in 1875]]\nThe architect of the Second Bank of the United States was [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] (1788\u20131854), a former student of [[Benjamin Latrobe]] (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American [[architect]]. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the [[Greek Revival]] style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the [[Mechanics National Bank]] (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]], [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main [[Philadelphia Mint|U.S. Mint in Philadelphia]] in 1833.\n\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]], and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture.<ref name=\"nhlnom\">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87001293}}|title=NHL nomination for Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-26}}</ref> The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the [[stylobate]]. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a [[triglyph]] [[frieze]] and simple triangular [[pediment]]. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Blue Marble|work=Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604135141/http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|archivedate=2009-06-04}}</ref> This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade.  Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\n\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in architecture used for the [[First Bank of the United States]], which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\n\n===Current building use===\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions. Today, it is part of [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushistory.org/tour/second-bank.htm|title=Historic Philadelphia Tour: Second Bank of the United States.|website=www.ushistory.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\nThe structure is open to the public free of charge and serves as an art gallery, housing a large collection of portraits of prominent early Americans painted by [[Charles Willson Peale]] and many others.\n\nThe building was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance.<ref name=\"nhlnom\"/>\n\nThe Wall Street branch in New York City was converted into the United States Assay Office before it was demolished in 1915. The federal-style fa\u00e7ade was saved and installed in the American Wing of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1924.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Bank of the United States building is mentioned in Chapter VII of Philadephia, and its solitary prison, [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens']] 1842 travelogue: <blockquote>We reached the city, late that night.\u00a0 Looking out of my chamber-window, before going to bed, I saw, on the opposite side of the way, a handsome building of white marble, which had a mournful ghost-like aspect, dreary to behold.\u00a0 I attributed this to the sombre influence of the night, and on rising in the morning looked out again, expecting to see its steps and portico thronged with groups of people passing in and out.\u00a0 The door was still tight shut, however; the same cold cheerless air prevailed: and the building looked as if the marble statue of [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Don Guzman]] could alone have any business to transact within its gloomy walls.\u00a0 I hastened to inquire its name and purpose, and then my surprise vanished.\u00a0 It was the Tomb of many fortunes; the Great Catacomb of investment; the memorable United States Bank.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The stoppage of this bank, with all its ruinous consequences, had cast (as I was told on every side) a gloom on Philadelphia, under the depressing effect of which it yet laboured.\u00a0 It certainly did seem rather dull and out of spirits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/675/675-h/675-h.htm#page81|title=American Notes for General Circulation pg 81, by Charles Dickens|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks|Philadelphia}}\n* [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era]]\n* [[Federal Reserve Act]]\n* [[Federal Reserve System]]\n* [[First Bank of the United States]]\n* [[History of central banking in the United States]]\n* ''[[McCulloch v.

Whereas other central banks of that era were wholly private, the BUS was more characteristic of a government bank.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 140</ref>\n\nUnder its charter, the bank had a capital limit of $35&nbsp;million, $7.5&nbsp;million of which represented the government-owned share. The central bank was required to remit a \"bonus\" payment of $1.5 million, payable in three installments,<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/> to the government for the privilege of using the public funds, interest free, in its private banking ventures.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, p. 364</ref> The institution was answerable for its performance to the U.S. Treasury and Congress<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 149\">Hammond, 1947, p. 149</ref> and subject to Treasury Department inspection.<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/>\n\nAs exclusive fiscal agent for the federal government,<ref>Wellman, 1966, p. 92, Hammond, 1947, p. 149</ref> it provided a number of services as part of its charter including: holding and transfer of all U.S. deposits, payment and receipt of all government transactions, and processing of tax payments.<ref>Wilentz, 2005, p. 365</ref> In other words, the BUS was \"the depository of the federal government, which was its principal stockholder and customer\".<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149, Hammond, 1957, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe chief personnel for the bank comprised twenty-five directors, five of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, subject to Senate approval.<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/> Federally appointed directors were barred from acting as officials in other banks. Two of the three BUS presidents, William Jones and Nicholas Biddle, were chosen from among these government directors.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 149\"/>\n\nHeadquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the bank was authorized to establish branch offices where it deemed suitable and these were [[McCulloch v. Maryland|immune from state taxation]].<ref name=\"Dangerfield, 1966, p. 12\"/>\n\n==BUS regulatory mechanisms==\n\nThe primary regulatory task of the Second Bank of the United States, as chartered by Congress in 1816, was to restrain the uninhibited proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private lenders,<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> which was highly profitable to these institutions.<ref>Wilentz, 2008, pp. 74\u201375</ref> \n  \nIn this capacity, the bank would preside over this democratization of credit,<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/><ref name=\"Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56\">Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/> \n  \nHistorian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the Bank exerted its anti-inflationary influence: \n  \n{{Quote|Receiving the checks and notes of local banks deposited with the [BUS] by government collectors of revenue, the [BUS] had constantly to come back on the local banks for settlements of the amounts which the checks and notes called for. It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This loss of specie reduced their power to lend.<ref>Hammond, 1956, pp. 9\u201310</ref>}} \n  \nUnder this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56</ref> It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury.<ref name=\"Hammond, 1947, p. 150\"/> The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions \u2013 from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837<ref>Hammond, 1947, p. 153</ref> \u2013 meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.<ref name=\"Wilentz, 2008, p. 205\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:United States Bank Philadelphia 1875.png|thumb|The building in a book published in 1875]]\nThe architect of the Second Bank of the United States was [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] (1788\u20131854), a former student of [[Benjamin Latrobe]] (1764\u20131820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American [[architect]]. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the [[Greek Revival]] style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the [[Mechanics National Bank]] (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]], [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]] branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main [[Philadelphia Mint|U.S. Mint in Philadelphia]] in 1833.\n\nStrickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens, Greece]], and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture.<ref name=\"nhlnom\">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|87001293}}|title=NHL nomination for Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-03-26}}</ref> The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa\u00e7ades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the [[stylobate]]. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a [[triglyph]] [[frieze]] and simple triangular [[pediment]]. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa\u00e7ade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Blue Marble|work=Second Bank of the United States|publisher=National Park Service|url=http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604135141/http://www.design.upenn.edu/hspv/second_bank/conservation/bluemarble.htm|archivedate=2009-06-04}}</ref> This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa\u00e7ade.  Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824.\n\nThe Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in architecture used for the [[First Bank of the United States]], which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa\u00e7ade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa\u00e7ade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple.\n\n===Current building use===\nSince the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions. Today, it is part of [[Independence National Historical Park]] in Philadelphia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushistory.org/tour/second-bank.htm|title=Historic Philadelphia Tour: Second Bank of the United States.|website=www.ushistory.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\nThe structure is open to the public free of charge and serves as an art gallery, housing a large collection of portraits of prominent early Americans painted by [[Charles Willson Peale]] and many others.\n\nThe building was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance.<ref name=\"nhlnom\"/>\n\nThe Wall Street branch in New York City was converted into the United States Assay Office before it was demolished in 1915. The federal-style fa\u00e7ade was saved and installed in the American Wing of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1924.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Bank of the United States building is mentioned in Chapter VII of Philadephia, and its solitary prison, [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens']] 1842 travelogue: <blockquote>We reached the city, late that night.\u00a0 Looking out of my chamber-window, before going to bed, I saw, on the opposite side of the way, a handsome building of white marble, which had a mournful ghost-like aspect, dreary to behold.\u00a0 I attributed this to the sombre influence of the night, and on rising in the morning looked out again, expecting to see its steps and portico thronged with groups of people passing in and out.\u00a0 The door was still tight shut, however; the same cold cheerless air prevailed: and the building looked as if the marble statue of [[Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n y Sotomayor, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Don Guzman]] could alone have any business to transact within its gloomy walls.\u00a0 I hastened to inquire its name and purpose, and then my surprise vanished.\u00a0 It was the Tomb of many fortunes; the Great Catacomb of investment; the memorable United States Bank.\n\nThe stoppage of this bank, with all its ruinous consequences, had cast (as I was told on every side) a gloom on Philadelphia, under the depressing effect of which it yet laboured.\u00a0 It certainly did seem rather dull and out of spirits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/675/675-h/675-h.htm#page81|title=American Notes for General Circulation pg 81, by Charles Dickens|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gutenberg.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks|Philadelphia}}\n* [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era]]\n* [[Federal Reserve Act]]\n* [[Federal Reserve System]]\n* [[First Bank of the United States]]\n* [[History of central banking in the United States]]\n* ''[[McCulloch v.

The training was based on the Bhutanese farming systems. Crops, livestock and forests are the integral parts of the rural livelihood system in Bhutan. The main reason to establish the NRTI was that the then-National Agriculture Training Institute located at Paro, the Royal Veterinary Institute at Serbithang and the Bhutan Forestry Institute at Taba was brought under one umbrella named as the Natural Resources Training Institute (NRTI) at Lobesa with funding support from Swiss Development Corporation (SDC), Helvetas and the Royal Government of Bhutan.\n\nCollege of Natural Resources,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unipage.net/en/universities?country_id%5B0%5D=34&per-page=5|title=University Rankings 2019 &#124; Top institutes abroad &#124; Best colleges overseas|website=www.unipage.net}}</ref> Royal University of Bhutan, was born as the Natural Resources Training Institute (NRTI)<ref name=\"rcbajo.gov.bt\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbc.gov.bt/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Biodiversity-Action-Plan-1997.pdf |title=BIODIVERSITY ACTION PLAN FOR BHUTAN |website=nbc.gov.bt|date=December 1997 |accessdate=2019-09-26}}</ref> in 1992 under the Ministry of Agriculture.

A Story|journal=The New England Magazine|volume= 11 |issue= 5 |date=January 1892}}</ref> It is regarded as an important early work of American [[feminism|feminist]] literature, due to its illustration of the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the 19th century.\n\nNarrated in the [[First-person narrative|first person]], the story is a collection of journal entries written by a woman whose physician husband (John) has rented an old mansion for the summer. Forgoing other rooms in the house, the couple moves into the upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment, the unnamed woman is forbidden from working, and is encouraged to eat well and get plenty of air, so she can recuperate from what he calls a \"temporary nervous [[clinical depression|depression]] \u2013 a slight [[Female hysteria|hysterical]] tendency\", a diagnosis common to women during that period.<ref>Gilman 1892, p. 1.</ref><ref>Treichler 1984, pp. 61\u201377.</ref><ref name=Gilman11>Gilman 1892, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story describes a young woman and her husband, who imposes as a [[rest cure]] on her when she suffers \"temporary nervous depression\" after the birth of their baby. They spend the summer at a colonial mansion, where the narrator is largely confined to an upstairs nursery.  The story makes striking use of an unreliable narrator in order to gradually reveal the degree to which her husband has imprisoned her: she describes torn wallpaper, barred windows, metal rings in the walls, a floor \"scratched and gouged and splintered,\" a bed bolted to the floor, and a gate at the top of the stairs, but blames all these on children who must have resided there.\n\nThe narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room \u2013 its \"sickly\" color, its \"yellow\" smell, its bizarre and disturbing pattern like \"an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,\" its missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design and eventually comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must free the woman in the wallpaper, the woman begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.\n\nOn the final day in the house, the narrator locks herself in her room to strip the remains of the wallpaper. When John arrives home, she refuses to unlock the door. When he returns with the key, he finds her creeping around the room, rubbing against the wallpaper, and exclaiming \"I've got out at last... in spite of you.\"  He faints, but she continues to circle the room, creeping over his inert body each time she passes it, believing herself to have become the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper.\n\n==Interpretation==\n\n===Gilman===\n[[File:Charlotte Perkins Gilman c. 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], c. 1900]]\nGilman used her writing to explore the role of women in America around 1900. She expanded upon many issues such as the lack of a life outside the home and the oppressive forces of the patriarchal society. Through her work, Gilman paved the way for writers such as [[Alice Walker]] and [[Sylvia Plath]].<ref name=\"Quawas, Rula 2006\">{{cite journal|author=Quawas, Rula|title=A New Woman's Journey Into Insanity: Descent and Return in The Yellow Wallpaper|journal= Journal of the Australasian Universities Modern Language Association |volume=2006|issue=105|date=2006|pages= 35\u201353|author-link=Rula Quawas|doi=10.1179/000127906805260310}}</ref> \n\nIn \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d she portrays the narrator's insanity as a way to protest the professional and societal oppression against women. While under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with their best interests in mind, women were depicted as mentally weak and fragile. [[Women\u2019s rights]] advocates of the era believed that the \"outbreak\" of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the roles they were allowed to play in a male-dominated society. Women were even discouraged from writing, because it would ultimately create an identity and become a form of defiance. Gilman realized that writing became one of the only forms of existence for women at a time when they had very few rights.<ref name=\"Quawas, Rula 2006\"/>\n\nGilman explained that the idea for the story originated in her own experience as a patient: \"the real purpose of the story was to reach [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|Dr. S. Weir Mitchell]], and convince him of the error of his ways\".<ref>Thrailkill 2002, p. 528.</ref> She had suffered years of depression and consulted a well-known specialist physician who prescribed a \"[[Bed rest|rest cure]]\" which required her to \"live as domestic a life as possible\". She was forbidden to touch pen, pencil, or brush, and was allowed only two hours of mental stimulation a day.\n\nAfter three months and almost desperate, Gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis, along with the treatment methods, and started to work again. Aware of how close she had come to complete mental breakdown, the author wrote \u201dThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her own criticism for the medical field. Gilman sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response. (Gilman was ultimately proven right in her disdain for the \"rest cure\" when she sought a second opinion from [[Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi|Mary Putnam Jacobi]], one of the first female doctors and a strong opponent of this theory, who prescribed a regimen of physical and mental activity that proved a much more successful treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/menstruation-women-suffrage-voting-nineteenth-amendment/593260/|title=The Pioneering Female Doctor Who Argued Against Rest|last=Koren|first=Marina|date=2019-07-06|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>)\n\nShe added that \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d was \"not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked\". Gilman claimed that many years later she learned that Mitchell had changed his treatment methods, but literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued his methods, and as late as 1908 \u2013 16 years after \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" was published \u2013 was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the \"rest cure\" so that his treatments would be more widely accessible.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilman, Charlotte Perkins| url=http://csivc.csi.cuny.edu/history/files/lavender/whyyw.html|work=The Forerunner|title = Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper|date= October 1913}}</ref>\n\n===Feminist===\nThis story has been interpreted by [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] as a condemnation of the male control of the 19th-century medical profession.<ref>Ford 1985, pp. 309\u2013314.</ref> Throughout the short story the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better such as exercising, working, or socializing with the outside world.  Her ideas, though, are dismissed immediately while using language that stereotypes her as irrational and, therefore, unqualified to offer ideas about her own condition. This interpretation draws on the concept of the \"[[Separate Spheres|domestic sphere]]\" that women were held in during this period.<ref>Thomas 1997.</ref>\n\nMany feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story. Although some claim the narrator slipped into insanity, others see the ending as a woman's assertion of agency in a marriage in which she felt trapped.<ref>Hochman, p. 2002, pp. 89\u2013110.</ref> The emphasis on reading and writing as [[Gender role|gendered practices]] also illustrated the importance of the wallpaper. If the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read, she would begin to \"read\" the wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for. Through seeing the women in the wallpaper, the narrator realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars. At the end of the story, as her husband lies on the floor unconscious, she crawls over him, symbolically rising over him. This is interpreted as a victory over her husband, at the expense of her sanity.\n\nIn her article \"Feminist Criticism \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019, and the Politics of Color in America\", Susan S. Lanser, a professor at Brandeis University, praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study and the interpretation of literature. \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" was one of many stories that lost authority in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works' content to be disturbing or offensive. Critics such as the editor of the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' rejected the short story because \"[he] could not forgive [himself] if [he] made others as miserable as [he] made [himself].\" Lanser argues that the same argument of devastation and misery can be said about the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], but his work is still printed and studied by academics.<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\">{{cite journal|last=Lanser|first=Susan|title=Feminist Criticism 'The Yellow Wallpaper', and the Politics of Color in America|journal=Feminist Studies|year=1989|volume=15|issue=3|pages=415\u2013441|jstor=3177938|doi=10.2307/3177938}}</ref>\n\n\"The Yellow Wallpaper\" provided feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways. Lanser argues that the short story was a \"particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision . . . because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall\".<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/> The narrator in the story is trying to find a single meaning in the wallpaper.  At first she focuses on contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is \"flamboyant\" while also \"dull\", \"pronounced\" yet also \"lame\" and \"uncertain\" (p.&nbsp;13).  She takes into account the patterns and tries to geometrically organize them, but she is further confused.  The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor which the protagonist cannot recognize (p.&nbsp;25). At night the narrator is able to see a woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that the unnamed woman was able to find \"a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection\".<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/> Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find a single meaning. \"How we were taught to read\" as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text.<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/> The patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as \"The Yellow Wallpaper.\"  With the growth of feminist criticism, \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" has become a fundamental reading in the standard curriculum. Feminists have made a great contribution to the study of literature but, according to Lanser, are falling short because if \"we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/>\n\nMartha J. Cutter discusses how in many of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works she addresses this \"struggle in which a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women.\"<ref name=Cutter>Cutter, Martha J. \"The Writer as Doctor: New Models of Medical Discourses in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Later Fiction,\" ''Literature and Medicine'' 2001 Fall; 20(2): 151-182.</ref> Gilman's works challenge the social construction of women in patriarchal medical discourse who are seen as \"silent, powerless, and passive\".<ref name=Cutter /> At the time in which her works take place, between 1840 and 1890, women were exceedingly defined as lesser than\u2014sickly and weak. In this time period it was thought that \"hysteria\" (a disease stereotypically more common in women) was a result of too much education. It was understood that women who spent time in college or studying were over-stimulating their brains and consequently leading themselves into states of hysteria. In fact, many of the diseases recognized in women were seen as the result of a lack of self-control or self-rule. Different physicians argued that a physician must \"assume a tone of authority\" and that the idea of a \"cured\" woman is one who is \"subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician\".<ref name=Cutter /> A hysterical woman is one who craves power and in order for her to be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to \"tame\" them and basically keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles. In her works, Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for woman, i.e. \"the rest cure,\" has to do with the way in which her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains \"In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public. . . . It is a male voice that . . . imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's\".<ref name=Treichler>Treichler, Paula A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/463825  \"Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper,'\"] ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' Vol. 3, No. 1/2, ''Feminist Issues in Literary Scholarship'' (Spring\u2013Autumn, 1984), pp. 61\u201377.</ref> The narrator in \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is not allowed to participate in her own treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one in which forces controls on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.\n\n===Other===\n\"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is sometimes referred to as an example of [[Gothic literature]] for its themes of madness and powerlessness.<ref>See, for example, Johnson 1989.</ref> Alan Ryan, for example, introduced the story by writing: \"quite apart from its origins [it] is one of the finest, and strongest, tales of [[Horror fiction|horror]] ever written. It may be a [[ghost story]]. Worse yet, it may not.\"<ref>Ryan 1988, p. 56.</ref> Pioneering horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft]] writes in his essay ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'' (1927) that \"'The Yellow Wall Paper' rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered room where a madwoman was once confined.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Lovecraft, H. P.|title=Supernatural Horror in Literature|work= The Recluse|publisher= The Recluse Press|date= 1927}}</ref> \n\nHelen Lefkowitz Horowitz, in her book ''Wild Unrest: Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Making of \"The Yellow Wall-Paper\"'', concludes that \"the story was a cri de coeur against [Gilman's first husband, artist Charles Walter] [[Charles Walter Stetson|Stetson]] and the traditional marriage he had demanded.\" Gilman was attempting to deflect blame to protect Gilman's daughter Katharine and her step-mother, Gilman's friend Grace Channing.<ref>''Publishers Weekly.'' October 4, 2010, p. 38.</ref> Horowitz consults the sources of Charlotte's private life, including her daily journals, drafts of poems and essays, and intimate letters, and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband. She also mines Charlotte's diaries for notes on her reading and shows how specific poetry, fiction, and popular science shaped her consciousness and understanding of sex and gender, health and illness, emotion and intellect. As a result, Horowitz makes some bold and compelling arguments. She builds a strong case to show that \"The Yellow Wall-Paper\", in its original form, did not represent a literal protest against Mitchell (A neurologist Gilman received treatment from in 1887) and his treatment. Rather it emerged from Charlotte's troubled relationship with her husband Walter, personified in the story's physician. In demanding a traditional wife, Walter denied Charlotte personal freedom, squelched her intellectual energy, and characterized her illness.\n\n[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Archbishop [[Peter Carnley]] used the story as a reference and a [[metaphor]] for the situation of women in the church in his sermon at the ordination of the first women priests in [[Australia]] on 7 March 1992 in [[St George's Cathedral, Perth]].<ref>Carnley, Peter (2001) pp. 85\u201392</ref>\n\nIn another interpretation, Sari Edelstein has argued that \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is an allegory for Gilman's hatred of the emerging [[yellow journalism]]. Having created ''[[Forerunner (magazine)|The Forerunner]]'' in November 1909, Gilman made it clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. Gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented the sensationalism of the media. The relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman's relationship to the press. The protagonist describes the wallpaper as having \"sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin\". Edelstein argues that given Gilman\u2019s distaste for the Yellow Press, this can also be seen as a description of tabloid newspapers of the day.<ref>Edelstein, Sari. \"Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Yellow Newspaper\" Legacy 24, no. 1 (May 2007): 72\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn Paula A. Treichler's article \"Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper'\", she places her focus on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of \". . . the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of [[neurasthenia]], the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy,\" Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the \". . . sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes.\" While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse, and the woman found in the wallpaper could be the \". . . representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak.\" In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported in the fact that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is the reason her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.<ref name=Treichler />\n\n==Dramatic adaptations==\n\n===Audio plays===\n*[[Agnes Moorehead]] performed a version twice, in 1948 and 1957, on the radio program ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''.\n*The [[CBC Radio]] drama [[Vanishing Point (CBC)|Vanishing Point]] did a radio version of [[Mary Vingoe]]'s adaptation for the stage at Toronto's [[Nightwood Theatre]] in 1985.\n*An audio book of \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" (1997) was produced by Durkin Hayes and read by [[Winifred Phillips]].

A Story|journal=The New England Magazine|volume= 11 |issue= 5 |date=January 1892}}</ref> It is regarded as an important early work of American [[feminism|feminist]] literature, due to its illustration of the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the 19th century.\n\nNarrated in the [[First-person narrative|first person]], the story is a collection of journal entries written by a woman whose physician husband (John) has rented an old mansion for the summer. Forgoing other rooms in the house, the couple moves into the upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment, the unnamed woman is forbidden from working, and is encouraged to eat well and get plenty of air, so she can recuperate from what he calls a \"temporary nervous [[clinical depression|depression]] \u2013 a slight [[Female hysteria|hysterical]] tendency\", a diagnosis common to women during that period.<ref>Gilman 1892, p. 1.</ref><ref>Treichler 1984, pp. 61\u201377.</ref><ref name=Gilman11>Gilman 1892, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story describes a young woman and her husband, who imposes as a [[rest cure]] on her when she suffers \"temporary nervous depression\" after the birth of their baby. They spend the summer at a colonial mansion, where the narrator is largely confined to an upstairs nursery.  The story makes striking use of an unreliable narrator in order to gradually reveal the degree to which her husband has imprisoned her: she describes torn wallpaper, barred windows, metal rings in the walls, a floor \"scratched and gouged and splintered,\" a bed bolted to the floor, and a gate at the top of the stairs, but blames all these on children who must have resided there.\n\nThe narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room \u2013 its \"sickly\" color, its \"yellow\" smell, its bizarre and disturbing pattern like \"an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,\" its missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design and eventually comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must free the woman in the wallpaper, the woman begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.\n\nOn the final day in the house, the narrator locks herself in her room to strip the remains of the wallpaper. When John arrives home, she refuses to unlock the door. When he returns with the key, he finds her creeping around the room, rubbing against the wallpaper, and exclaiming \"I've got out at last... in spite of you.\"  He faints, but she continues to circle the room, creeping over his inert body each time she passes it, believing herself to have become the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper.\n\n==Interpretation==\n\n===Gilman===\n[[File:Charlotte Perkins Gilman c. 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=photograph|[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], c. 1900]]\nGilman used her writing to explore the role of women in America around 1900. She expanded upon many issues such as the lack of a life outside the home and the oppressive forces of the patriarchal society. Through her work, Gilman paved the way for writers such as [[Alice Walker]] and [[Sylvia Plath]].<ref name=\"Quawas, Rula 2006\">{{cite journal|author=Quawas, Rula|title=A New Woman's Journey Into Insanity: Descent and Return in The Yellow Wallpaper|journal= Journal of the Australasian Universities Modern Language Association |volume=2006|issue=105|date=2006|pages= 35\u201353|author-link=Rula Quawas|doi=10.1179/000127906805260310}}</ref> \n\nIn \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d she portrays the narrator's insanity as a way to protest the professional and societal oppression against women. While under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with their best interests in mind, women were depicted as mentally weak and fragile. [[Women\u2019s rights]] advocates of the era believed that the \"outbreak\" of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the roles they were allowed to play in a male-dominated society. Women were even discouraged from writing, because it would ultimately create an identity and become a form of defiance. Gilman realized that writing became one of the only forms of existence for women at a time when they had very few rights.<ref name=\"Quawas, Rula 2006\"/>\n\nGilman explained that the idea for the story originated in her own experience as a patient: \"the real purpose of the story was to reach [[Silas Weir Mitchell (physician)|Dr. S. Weir Mitchell]], and convince him of the error of his ways\".<ref>Thrailkill 2002, p. 528.</ref> She had suffered years of depression and consulted a well-known specialist physician who prescribed a \"[[Bed rest|rest cure]]\" which required her to \"live as domestic a life as possible\". She was forbidden to touch pen, pencil, or brush, and was allowed only two hours of mental stimulation a day.\n\nAfter three months and almost desperate, Gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis, along with the treatment methods, and started to work again. Aware of how close she had come to complete mental breakdown, the author wrote \u201dThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her own criticism for the medical field. Gilman sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response. (Gilman was ultimately proven right in her disdain for the \"rest cure\" when she sought a second opinion from [[Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi|Mary Putnam Jacobi]], one of the first female doctors and a strong opponent of this theory, who prescribed a regimen of physical and mental activity that proved a much more successful treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/menstruation-women-suffrage-voting-nineteenth-amendment/593260/|title=The Pioneering Female Doctor Who Argued Against Rest|last=Koren|first=Marina|date=2019-07-06|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>)\n\nShe added that \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper\u201d was \"not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked\". Gilman claimed that many years later she learned that Mitchell had changed his treatment methods, but literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued his methods, and as late as 1908 \u2013 16 years after \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" was published \u2013 was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the \"rest cure\" so that his treatments would be more widely accessible.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gilman, Charlotte Perkins| url=http://csivc.csi.cuny.edu/history/files/lavender/whyyw.html|work=The Forerunner|title = Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper|date= October 1913}}</ref>\n\n===Feminist===\nThis story has been interpreted by [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] as a condemnation of the male control of the 19th-century medical profession.<ref>Ford 1985, pp. 309\u2013314.</ref> Throughout the short story the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better such as exercising, working, or socializing with the outside world.  Her ideas, though, are dismissed immediately while using language that stereotypes her as irrational and, therefore, unqualified to offer ideas about her own condition. This interpretation draws on the concept of the \"[[Separate Spheres|domestic sphere]]\" that women were held in during this period.<ref>Thomas 1997.</ref>\n\nMany feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story. Although some claim the narrator slipped into insanity, others see the ending as a woman's assertion of agency in a marriage in which she felt trapped.<ref>Hochman, p. 2002, pp. 89\u2013110.</ref> The emphasis on reading and writing as [[Gender role|gendered practices]] also illustrated the importance of the wallpaper. If the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read, she would begin to \"read\" the wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for. Through seeing the women in the wallpaper, the narrator realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars. At the end of the story, as her husband lies on the floor unconscious, she crawls over him, symbolically rising over him. This is interpreted as a victory over her husband, at the expense of her sanity.\n\nIn her article \"Feminist Criticism \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019, and the Politics of Color in America\", Susan S. Lanser, a professor at Brandeis University, praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study and the interpretation of literature. \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" was one of many stories that lost authority in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works' content to be disturbing or offensive. Critics such as the editor of the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' rejected the short story because \"[he] could not forgive [himself] if [he] made others as miserable as [he] made [himself].\" Lanser argues that the same argument of devastation and misery can be said about the work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], but his work is still printed and studied by academics.<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\">{{cite journal|last=Lanser|first=Susan|title=Feminist Criticism 'The Yellow Wallpaper', and the Politics of Color in America|journal=Feminist Studies|year=1989|volume=15|issue=3|pages=415\u2013441|jstor=3177938|doi=10.2307/3177938}}</ref>\n\n\"The Yellow Wallpaper\" provided feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways. Lanser argues that the short story was a \"particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision . . . because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall\".<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/> The narrator in the story is trying to find a single meaning in the wallpaper.  At first she focuses on contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is \"flamboyant\" while also \"dull\", \"pronounced\" yet also \"lame\" and \"uncertain\" (p.&nbsp;13).  She takes into account the patterns and tries to geometrically organize them, but she is further confused.  The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor which the protagonist cannot recognize (p.&nbsp;25). At night the narrator is able to see a woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that the unnamed woman was able to find \"a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection\".<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/> Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find a single meaning. \"How we were taught to read\" as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text.<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/> The patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as \"The Yellow Wallpaper.\"  With the growth of feminist criticism, \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" has become a fundamental reading in the standard curriculum. Feminists have made a great contribution to the study of literature but, according to Lanser, are falling short because if \"we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.<ref name=\"Lanser 1989 415\u2013441\"/>\n\nMartha J. Cutter discusses how in many of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works she addresses this \"struggle in which a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women.\"<ref name=Cutter>Cutter, Martha J. \"The Writer as Doctor: New Models of Medical Discourses in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Later Fiction,\" ''Literature and Medicine'' 2001 Fall; 20(2): 151-182.</ref> Gilman's works challenge the social construction of women in patriarchal medical discourse who are seen as \"silent, powerless, and passive\".<ref name=Cutter /> At the time in which her works take place, between 1840 and 1890, women were exceedingly defined as lesser than\u2014sickly and weak. In this time period it was thought that \"hysteria\" (a disease stereotypically more common in women) was a result of too much education. It was understood that women who spent time in college or studying were over-stimulating their brains and consequently leading themselves into states of hysteria. In fact, many of the diseases recognized in women were seen as the result of a lack of self-control or self-rule. Different physicians argued that a physician must \"assume a tone of authority\" and that the idea of a \"cured\" woman is one who is \"subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician\".<ref name=Cutter /> A hysterical woman is one who craves power and in order for her to be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to \"tame\" them and basically keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles. In her works, Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for woman, i.e. \"the rest cure,\" has to do with the way in which her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains \"In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public. . . . It is a male voice that . . . imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's\".<ref name=Treichler>Treichler, Paula A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/463825  \"Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper,'\"] ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' Vol. 3, No. 1/2, ''Feminist Issues in Literary Scholarship'' (Spring\u2013Autumn, 1984), pp. 61\u201377.</ref> The narrator in \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is not allowed to participate in her own treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one in which forces controls on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.\n\n===Other===\n\"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is sometimes referred to as an example of [[Gothic literature]] for its themes of madness and powerlessness.<ref>See, for example, Johnson 1989.</ref> Alan Ryan, for example, introduced the story by writing: \"quite apart from its origins [it] is one of the finest, and strongest, tales of [[Horror fiction|horror]] ever written. It may be a [[ghost story]]. Worse yet, it may not.\"<ref>Ryan 1988, p. 56.</ref> Pioneering horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft]] writes in his essay ''[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]'' (1927) that \"'The Yellow Wall Paper' rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered room where a madwoman was once confined.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Lovecraft, H. P.|title=Supernatural Horror in Literature|work= The Recluse|publisher= The Recluse Press|date= 1927}}</ref> \n\nHelen Lefkowitz Horowitz, in her book ''Wild Unrest: Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Making of \"The Yellow Wall-Paper\"'', concludes that \"the story was a cri de coeur against [Gilman's first husband, artist Charles Walter] [[Charles Walter Stetson|Stetson]] and the traditional marriage he had demanded.\" Gilman was attempting to deflect blame to protect Gilman's daughter Katharine and her step-mother, Gilman's friend Grace Channing.<ref>''Publishers Weekly.'' October 4, 2010, p. 38.</ref> Horowitz consults the sources of Charlotte's private life, including her daily journals, drafts of poems and essays, and intimate letters, and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband. She also mines Charlotte's diaries for notes on her reading and shows how specific poetry, fiction, and popular science shaped her consciousness and understanding of sex and gender, health and illness, emotion and intellect. As a result, Horowitz makes some bold and compelling arguments. She builds a strong case to show that \"The Yellow Wall-Paper\", in its original form, did not represent a literal protest against Mitchell (A neurologist Gilman received treatment from in 1887) and his treatment. Rather it emerged from Charlotte's troubled relationship with her husband Walter, personified in the story's physician. In demanding a traditional wife, Walter denied Charlotte personal freedom, squelched her intellectual energy, and characterized her illness.\n\n[[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Archbishop [[Peter Carnley]] used the story as a reference and a [[metaphor]] for the situation of women in the church in his sermon at the ordination of the first women priests in [[Australia]] on 7 March 1992 in [[St George's Cathedral, Perth]].<ref>Carnley, Peter (2001) pp. 85\u201392</ref>\n\nIn another interpretation, Sari Edelstein has argued that \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" is an allegory for Gilman's hatred of the emerging [[yellow journalism]]. Having created ''[[Forerunner (magazine)|The Forerunner]]'' in November 1909, Gilman made it clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. Gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented the sensationalism of the media. The relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman's relationship to the press. The protagonist describes the wallpaper as having \"sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin\". Edelstein argues that given Gilman\u2019s distaste for the Yellow Press, this can also be seen as a description of tabloid newspapers of the day.<ref>Edelstein, Sari. \"Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Yellow Newspaper\" Legacy 24, no. 1 (May 2007): 72\u201392.</ref>\n\nIn Paula A. Treichler's article \"Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper'\", she places her focus on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of \". . . the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of [[neurasthenia]], the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy,\" Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the \". . . sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes.\" While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse, and the woman found in the wallpaper could be the \". . . representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak.\" In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported in the fact that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is the reason her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.<ref name=Treichler />\n\n==Dramatic adaptations==\n\n===Audio plays===\n*[[Agnes Moorehead]] performed a version twice, in 1948 and 1957, on the radio program ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''.\n*The [[CBC Radio]] drama [[Vanishing Point (CBC)|Vanishing Point]] did a radio version of [[Mary Vingoe]]'s adaptation for the stage at Toronto's [[Nightwood Theatre]] in 1985.\n*An audio book of \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" (1997) was produced by Durkin Hayes and read by [[Winifred Phillips]].

Her character, although anti-heroic, works throughout the season as a portrait of frustrated domesticity.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman]]'' - an unfinished novel about a woman imprisoned in an asylum\n* [[Changeling (film)|''Changeling'']] - a film about a woman imprisoned in a mental hospital\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Barth, Melissa E.
