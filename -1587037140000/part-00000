An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Geek Toys]] premiered on January 8, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by numbers, every human being has their worth measured by a special 'Count' imprinted somewhere on their bodies, which defines any number related to an important aspect of their lives. However, if this Count decreases to 0, the person will be dragged down into \"the abyss\", and is said to be dead for all eternity. \n\nFor young Hina, her Count corresponds to how many hundreds of kilometers she has walked. Ever since her mother was dragged into the abyss, she has been searching for the Legendary Ace from her mother's last wish for the last five years. Hina's grueling journey takes a sudden turn when she meets a strange masked knight known as Licht Bach with a negative-numbered Count.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Licht Bach/Rihito Sakai|\u30ea\u30d2\u30c8\u30fc{{=}}\u30d0\u30c3\u30cf/\u5742\u4e95\u96e2\u4eba|Rihit\u014d Bahha/Sakai Rihit\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yoshiki Nakajima]]<ref name=\"release date\"/>|[[Eric Vale]]}}<ref name=\"Funimation Plunderer Announcement\">{{cite web |title=Meet the Cast and Characters of Plunderer, Coming to FunimationNow in January|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2019/08/31/meet-the-cast-and-characters-of-plunderer-coming-to-funimationnow-in-january/ |website=Funimation|date=August 31, 2019|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n:First apearing as a strange pervert in a mask, Licht is later revealed to be a Legendary Fabled Ace (powerful heroes that lived over 300 years ago where they put an end to the ongoing waste war) while seamingly carring two counts (a ballot) it is hinted that he may have another.

If it ever reaches 0 they are dragged into a dark abyss. Hina witnesses her mother being dragged into the abyss, but not before her mother gives her a glass orb with 10,000 inside it and tells her to find the Legendary Ace with the white star. Hina searches for five years until one day she meets Licht, a masked perverted idiot, and his boss, Nana, who explains that all people are forced to obey orders from anyone with a higher number. Hina explains her number, 441, comes from having walked 44,100 kilometres. She meets a sergeant major with a star on his face who claims to be the Ace. He attempts to molest her, until she shows him the 10,000 orb, which he identifies as a Ballot and tries to take it from her. As Hina has a higher number she orders him to stop, so he tricks her into a Star Stake, a duel wagering their numbers, and after severely beating her he takes 440 from her, leaving her with only 1. He reveals he is not the Ace as the legend of the Ace is three hundred years old, meaning the Ace is long dead. Licht suddenly arrives and wagers his own number, negative 999. As they duel the sergeant realises such a number is impossible, unless Licht is a Ballot Holder with a numbered Ballot to artificially raise his number back above 0. Licht reveals himself as Licht Bach, the real Legendary Ace, with a white star and 5700 printed on his sword, the number of enemies he has defeated. He swears he will force the sergeant to give back Hina\u2019s 440. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = I Hate You!\n| TranslitTitle       = Daikkirai!\n| NativeTitle         = \u3060\u3044\u3063\u304d\u3089\u3044\uff01\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|1|15}}{{efn|name=preview}}\n| ShortSummary        = Centuries ago a Great War known as the Waste War raged across the planet. A group of warriors known as Aces distinguished themselves with feats of superhuman strength, only to vanish once the war ended. Licht easily defeats the soldiers with his super speed, showing that his footsteps contain enough power to shatter the ground. Nana explains Licht\u2019s speed earned him the name Ace of Flashing Strikes, and that while his 5700 is the number of his defeated enemies, his negative 999 is the number of women who have rejected him. Licht easily defeats the sergeant, reducing his number to 1 and giving Hina not only her stolen 440, but the rest of his number as well, raising Hina\u2019s number to 760. Licht suddenly steals Hina\u2019s 10,000 Ballot, leaving her a stuffed doll in exchange. Hina is devastated at losing her memento of her mother. Nana later reveals Licht hid the Ballot in the doll and only pretended to steal it in front of witnesses, since Ballots are illegal, meaning the soldiers will only search for him and leave Hina alone. Hina tearfully tries to stop Licht leaving, but when he ignores her pleas she shouts that she hates him, changing his negative 999 to negative 1000. Hina is suddenly confronted by one of the soldiers who reveals he is actually a spy. He thanks her for helping him and informs his real masters that Licht has finally been located. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Uniforms are Uniforms\n| TranslitTitle       = Seifuku da kara shikatanai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5236\u670d\u3060\u304b\u3089\u4ed5\u65b9\u306a\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|1|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = The army ignores Hina and begins looking for Licht, believing him to have the Ballot. Master Sergeant Lynn May and her subordinate, Sergeant Pele Poporo, are stationed in a peaceful village where Lynn spends her time volunteering, as her count goes up based on how many desperate people she helps. Based on a description of Licht Lynn apprehends a nearby masked man, who coincidentally does happen to be Licht, but he holds onto his mask by revealing his negative 1000 and crying over the women who rejected him. Following terrible advice from Pele, Lynn tries to help Licht feel better with a pity date, only for Licht\u2019s typical groping behaviour to actually cause Lynn\u2019s count to rise as the groping helps the desperately perverse Licht feel better. Pele suddenly points out that Licht\u2019s negative 1000 means he must be a Ballot Holder, something Lynn had not yet figured out, so she removes his mask, revealing his identity. Licht steals her sword, only to realise Lynn is also a martial artist. During their short fight she becomes so flustered by Licht\u2019s flirting he manages to escape when she closes her eyes expecting a kiss, greatly irritating her. A Lieutenant named Jail Murdoch interrogates Nana to learn Licht\u2019s whereabouts, destroying her food wagon when she tries to lie, and then setting out to hunt Licht down.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Ballot Holder\n| TranslitTitle       = Barotto horud\u0101\n| NativeTitle         = {{Ruby-ja|\u9055\u6cd5\u6240\u6301\u8005|\u30d0\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc}}\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|1|29}}\n| ShortSummary        = Following Licht\u2019s escape Lynn continues her volunteer work but is despondent over having lost a potential promotion. However, Licht reappears so she chases him through the village where several misunderstandings lead the villagers to think she and Licht are having a lover\u2019s quarrel and Licht escapes again when she complains about her uniform always exposing her underwear. Hina decides she must warn Licht about Lieutenant Murdoch but cannot as they must first rebuild Nana\u2019s wagon. Licht wonders about the villagers who seem more interested in living peacefully than helping catch criminals. Lynn keeps being distracted from chasing him by the villager\u2019s problems and Licht comes to admire her, revealing himself again so Lynn can enjoy continuing to chase him. Licht suddenly saves Lynn from being hurt when Murdoch and his soldiers attack him. Murdoch\u2019s number is revealed to be 900, along with his Ballot that allows him to create iron weapons, hence his nickname \"Iron Jail\". Licht is surprisingly overwhelmed and Murdoch reveals he keeps his real number hidden from his superiors to avoid a promotion that would put him behind a desk in an office instead of hunting criminals. His true number is 12,500, over twice Licht\u2019s number.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Don't Apologize, Apologize\n| TranslitTitle       = Ayamaruna, ayamare\n| NativeTitle         = \u8b1d\u308b\u306a\u3001\u8b1d\u308c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|2|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Murdoch succeeds in taking Licht\u2019s sword but gives it back. He reveals his number represents his convictions, and that his iron weapons are strengthened by his convictions, and have never been cut. He traps Licht so Licht surrenders. Murdoch accuses Licht of once being a soldier, based on his fighting style. When Licht refuses to answer Murdoch decides to torture him, but Lynn steps in and is injured. Murdoch, disgusted by Lynn\u2019s failure to punish criminals in favour of her charity work, berates her. Lynn almost apologises, until Licht stops her. He breaks free from his restraints, revealing he was always capable of breaking the Murdochs iron. As he and Murdoch unleash their true powers Licht demands he apologise for assuming Lynn is lazy when she constantly works harder than everyone. Their fight collapses a cliff, sending Lynn falling, and a repentant Murdoch tries to catch her, but Licht catches her first. He manages to insult her, angering her, causing his count to decrease to negative 1001. He then passes her to Murdoch who lets him escape. Realising Licht was right Murdoch creates a play area for the village\u2019s children from his iron, deciding to give Licht a 3 day head start before resuming his search, with Lynn joining him. As he reluctantly fixes a child\u2019s broken doll his 12500 decreases to 12499 for giving up his conviction to catch Licht.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Hunch\n| TranslitTitle       = Kan\n| NativeTitle         = \u52d8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|2|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Licht is found by Hina and Nana and learns that after his fight against \u201cIron Jail\u201d Murdoch, all the roads have been blocked. Hina appears jealous Licht was fighting for another woman and scolds him for leaving her behind. Licht is forced to save a girl named Pelmo from falling to her death in an experimental [[Biplane|aeroplane]]. Pelmo asks Licht and Hina to help make her dream of flight come true, even though researching flight is a crime punishable by death. Licht modifies her latest design, but worries he has only put her in danger, despite Hina praising him. Hina asks what Licht\u2019s dream is, but he refuses to reveal it, instead claiming it is to see her panties. Pelmo interrupts, having finished the new aeroplane. Soldiers arrive and Licht is forced to destroy the aeroplane. The soldiers leave after being convinced the wings were broken windmill sails. An abyss suddenly opens up and Pelmo reveals her count was based on her dreams coming true, but it went down each time her aeroplanes failed to fly, and now it has reached 0. Hina tries to save her, but the abyss fights back. Licht tries to save Hina, but when the abyss hits his sword he suffers a violent flashback. Pelmo happily enters the abyss, convinced it is not death but the door to another world, and promises to see them again one day.

Lynn catches up to Licht and thanks him for saving her, but then tries to arrest him. With Lynn and Hina having met they swap stories of how they know Licht, and become mad at him. Nana arranges a cooking battle between Lynn and Hina to draw in customers, with Licht as the prize. Lynn buys vegetables while Hina traps wild beasts, showing she is intimidatingly skilled at killing dangerous animals. Lynn creates a vegetable stew while Hina creates a meat stew with a deadly aura. Licht enjoys both but while Hina\u2019s is clearly superior Licht is put on the spot when the crowd demands he choose a winner. He is saved from having to disappoint one of them when Murdoch arrives and berates Lynn for being distracted again. Licht threatens to run away, placing the blame on Murdoch instead of Lynn. After a short fight Nana steps in and berates them both for acting like children and damaging the town square. Surprisingly, even Murdoch is overwhelmed by her forceful personality and does as she says, even joining in the festivities. The next morning Murdoch, Lynn and Pele awaken, hung-over, with Nana, Licht and Hina having snuck away during the night.

Murdoch insists it must be a ballot holder with fire abilities. Lynn and Pele take the soldier for treatment in the next town where they find Licht, Hina and Nana. Murdoch confronts Licht, convinced he knows something. Nana angrily bans them from fighting, so instead they have a drinking contest. Murdoch drunkenly accuses Licht of being the Legendary Ace and demands to know why the army are looking for him. Licht provokes Murdoch into drinking even more while Nana decides to join in too. Lynn becomes tipsy after only one glass and asks Hina what her relationship with Licht is. Licht and Murdoch eventually pass out. Both Lynn and Hina try to let Licht use their laps as a pillow. The lake abyss suddenly appears, destroying part of the town, and begins emanating a strange noise. Murdoch orders the civilians evacuated while Licht recognises the sound. He claims the sound is impossible as all such demons were defeated during the Waste War. He and Murdoch watch as the abyss opens and the demon is revealed to be a modern helicopter armed with machine guns and missiles.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Plunderer\n| TranslitTitle       = Purandara\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|4}}\n| ShortSummary        =  The helicopter attacks and Licht tells everyone to take cover but Murdoch resists Licht taking command. Licht reveals he holds a military rank of Colonel and draws the helicopters attention while Murdoch is confused how a criminal could be a Colonel. Everyone begins cheering as Licht attacks the helicopter but the abyss stops him. Lynn reveals the military calls the abyss\u2019 arms Althing. Althing tries to grab the helicopter while Licht attacks Althing but is shocked by it repeatedly. Hina asks Murdoch to help but he refuses as attacking Althing is punishable by execution and he will not let anyone break the law. However Murdoch \u201caccidentally\u201d loses his glasses. Unable to see any laws being broken Murdoch attacks Althing and the soldiers all coincidentally go blind as well. They create a ladder for Licht to reach the helicopter but he is shocked after seeing inside the cockpit. The helicopter is suddenly shot down by the homicidally insane \"Ace of Pursuit\" Sonohara Mizuka, who possesses the number 32,000. She shoots Murdoch and begins murdering everybody, revealing she is obsessed with following the last order Licht gave her during the Waste War, to kill everybody. Sonohara reveals Licht\u2019s real name is Rihito and she wants him to revert to his former bloodthirsty personality and kill her, or she will murder a nearby child. Licht snaps and kills her men so fast their bodies simply disappear. Licht finally answers Hina and Murdoch\u2019s questions of who he is.

A red power violently erupts from Licht, increasing the count on his sword to 57,000, and he begins moving so fast Sonohara cannot see him. Nana reveals that Licht has been taken over by an evil alternate personality called Schmelman. Schmelman defeats Sonohara and her count drops to 16,000, causing Nana to suspect Sonohara had also been under the influence of an evil personality. Based on her knowledge of Licht\u2019s past Nana explains Sonohara was actually the kindest of the Aces who never killed anyone, but someone must have drugged her to fight Licht, hoping Schmelman would emerge. Hina desperately hugs him so Schmelman almost kills her, but Sonohara saves her. As Schmelman moves to kill Sonohara, she has a flashback to modern Japan, when she and Licht were in high school together. Schmelman is stopped by Murdoch, who challenges him despite the bullet in his chest. As they duel Schmelman begins to cry and claims he kills enemies so his friends won\u2019t have to. Deciding to honour this Murdoch fights with all his power and creates an iron warrior which knocks Schmelman unconscious, turning him back into Licht. Murdoch passes out from his injury.

Gregorovich reveals they are the Special Services Unit, or SSU, that serves the Royal family as spies, kidnappers and assassins. Concerning Licht Gregorovich reveals the Aces were surgically altered human weapons for the Waste Wars, and Licht was the strongest member of the strongest squad. A side effect of the surgery caused the Aces to stop aging, explaining Licht still being alive. Gregorovich suddenly reveals he knows Murdoch\u2019s number has dropped to 12,499 and demands to know if he knows Licht\u2019s location. Murdoch lies, and it drops to 12,498 so Gregorovich reveals he also knows that attacked Althing. Murdoch returns to finally arrest Licht, who decides to surrender. A nearby spy reveals they want Licht to continue plundering. Licht asks Murdoch several questions to determine if he is being blackmailed and Murdoch lies repeatedly, dropping his number to 12,496, before trying to arrest Licht. Nana reveals she herself is an Ace and, with an unexplained power, sends Murdoch, Hina, Pele and Lynn to modern Japan, begging them to change the past where she failed.

The Headmaster, Major Schmelman, who begins by reading his version of the Tortoise and the Hare, then having Alan shoot three recruits who laughed. Rihito takes Schmelman hostage so Schmelman teaches Rihito how to break his neck, but Rihito refuses and instead offers to die in Hina\u2019s place, ignoring Schmelman\u2019s intense killing aura. Firenda calms the situation by revealing the recruits are alive as Alan had used paint bullets to make a point about obeying orders. Schmelman takes an interest in Rihito\u2019s potential while Murdoch is confused that Rihito is clearly a young Licht, yet looks nothing like his future self at all. Pele tries to research Althing on a computer but is blocked. Instead Alan explains Althing was a super advanced technology of unknown origin that fell to earth in the middle of the war. It had the power to force all humans to obey its will following a vote, so humanity voted to destroy nuclear weaponry and ban all war, however, this had unintended consequences that Alan refuses to talk about.

Licht claims not to care as he is only there to convince his adopted brother, Sakai Tokikaze, to return home. Doan, the delinquent, breaks into people\u2019s lockers and steals their stars, including Sakai\u2019s, threatening Sakai\u2019s grandmother when he resists, as Doan\u2019s parents are her landlords. To prevent expulsion everyone shares their stars but none is left for Sakai. Sakai refuses to return home because soldier\u2019s families get more food and their grandmother is already ill from malnutrition. Murdoch gives Sakai his remaining star then confronts Doan just outside the gate, warning him the moment Doan leaves academy property he will cripple him before his military career even begins. Schmelman interrupts and it is revealed Rihito pickpocketed Doan\u2019s stolen stars, leaving him with only two and unable to graduate yet. For his loyalty to his classmates Schmelman gives Murdoch two stars. Rihito keeps two stars and decides to stay to convince Sakai to return home, reasoning that as long as they are at the academy they can send their own food rations to their grandmother.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = 7 Minutes 12 Seconds\n| TranslitTitle       = Nana fun j\u016bni by\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = 7\u520612\u79d2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 15\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 19\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 20\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 21\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 22\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}-->\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://web-ace.jp/shonenace/contents/13/|Official manga website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|http://plunderer-info.com/|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|manga|20675}}\n\n{{Geek Toys}}\n\n[[Category:2020 anime television series]]\n[[Category: Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category: Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category: Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category: Geek Toys]]\n[[Category: Kadokawa Shoten manga]]\n[[Category: Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category: Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category: Yen Press titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese manga series}}\n{{Other uses|Plunderer (disambiguation){{!}}Plunderer}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Plunderer\n| image           = Plunderer manga, volume 1.jpg\n| caption         = Cover of the first manga volume\n| ja_kanji        = \u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e9\n| ja_romaji       = Purandara\n| genre           = [[Action fiction|Action]], [[fantasy]]<ref name=\"manga\" /><!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Geek Toys]] premiered on January 8, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by numbers, every human being has their worth measured by a special 'Count' imprinted somewhere on their bodies, which defines any number related to an important aspect of their lives. However, if this Count decreases to 0, the person will be dragged down into \"the abyss\", and is said to be dead for all eternity. \n\nFor young Hina, her Count corresponds to how many hundreds of kilometers she has walked. Ever since her mother was dragged into the abyss, she has been searching for the Legendary Ace from her mother's last wish for the last five years. Hina's grueling journey takes a sudden turn when she meets a strange masked knight known as Licht Bach with a negative-numbered Count.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Licht Bach/Rihito Sakai|\u30ea\u30d2\u30c8\u30fc{{=}}\u30d0\u30c3\u30cf/\u5742\u4e95\u96e2\u4eba|Rihit\u014d Bahha/Sakai Rihit\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yoshiki Nakajima]]<ref name=\"release date\"/>|[[Eric Vale]]}}<ref name=\"Funimation Plunderer Announcement\">{{cite web |title=Meet the Cast and Characters of Plunderer, Coming to FunimationNow in January|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2019/08/31/meet-the-cast-and-characters-of-plunderer-coming-to-funimationnow-in-january/ |website=Funimation|date=August 31, 2019|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n:First apearing as a strange pervert in a mask, Licht is later revealed to be a Legendary Fabled Ace (powerful heroes that lived over 300 years ago where they put an end to the ongoing waste war) while seamingly carring two counts (a ballot) it is hinted that he may have another.

If it ever reaches 0 they are dragged into a dark abyss. Hina witnesses her mother being dragged into the abyss, but not before her mother gives her a glass orb with 10,000 inside it and tells her to find the Legendary Ace with the white star. Hina searches for five years until one day she meets Licht, a masked perverted idiot, and his boss, Nana, who explains that all people are forced to obey orders from anyone with a higher number. Hina explains her number, 441, comes from having walked 44,100 kilometres. She meets a sergeant major with a star on his face who claims to be the Ace. He attempts to molest her, until she shows him the 10,000 orb, which he identifies as a Ballot and tries to take it from her. As Hina has a higher number she orders him to stop, so he tricks her into a Star Stake, a duel wagering their numbers, and after severely beating her he takes 440 from her, leaving her with only 1. He reveals he is not the Ace as the legend of the Ace is three hundred years old, meaning the Ace is long dead. Licht suddenly arrives and wagers his own number, negative 999. As they duel the sergeant realises such a number is impossible, unless Licht is a Ballot Holder with a numbered Ballot to artificially raise his number back above 0. Licht reveals himself as Licht Bach, the real Legendary Ace, with a white star and 5700 printed on his sword, the number of enemies he has defeated. He swears he will force the sergeant to give back Hina\u2019s 440. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = I Hate You!\n| TranslitTitle       = Daikkirai!\n| NativeTitle         = \u3060\u3044\u3063\u304d\u3089\u3044\uff01\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|1|15}}{{efn|name=preview}}\n| ShortSummary        = Centuries ago a Great War known as the Waste War raged across the planet. A group of warriors known as Aces distinguished themselves with feats of superhuman strength, only to vanish once the war ended. Licht easily defeats the soldiers with his super speed, showing that his footsteps contain enough power to shatter the ground. Nana explains Licht\u2019s speed earned him the name Ace of Flashing Strikes, and that while his 5700 is the number of his defeated enemies, his negative 999 is the number of women who have rejected him. Licht easily defeats the sergeant, reducing his number to 1 and giving Hina not only her stolen 440, but the rest of his number as well, raising Hina\u2019s number to 760. Licht suddenly steals Hina\u2019s 10,000 Ballot, leaving her a stuffed doll in exchange. Hina is devastated at losing her memento of her mother. Nana later reveals Licht hid the Ballot in the doll and only pretended to steal it in front of witnesses, since Ballots are illegal, meaning the soldiers will only search for him and leave Hina alone. Hina tearfully tries to stop Licht leaving, but when he ignores her pleas she shouts that she hates him, changing his negative 999 to negative 1000. Hina is suddenly confronted by one of the soldiers who reveals he is actually a spy. He thanks her for helping him and informs his real masters that Licht has finally been located. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Uniforms are Uniforms\n| TranslitTitle       = Seifuku da kara shikatanai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5236\u670d\u3060\u304b\u3089\u4ed5\u65b9\u306a\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|1|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = The army ignores Hina and begins looking for Licht, believing him to have the Ballot. Master Sergeant Lynn May and her subordinate, Sergeant Pele Poporo, are stationed in a peaceful village where Lynn spends her time volunteering, as her count goes up based on how many desperate people she helps. Based on a description of Licht Lynn apprehends a nearby masked man, who coincidentally does happen to be Licht, but he holds onto his mask by revealing his negative 1000 and crying over the women who rejected him. Following terrible advice from Pele, Lynn tries to help Licht feel better with a pity date, only for Licht\u2019s typical groping behaviour to actually cause Lynn\u2019s count to rise as the groping helps the desperately perverse Licht feel better. Pele suddenly points out that Licht\u2019s negative 1000 means he must be a Ballot Holder, something Lynn had not yet figured out, so she removes his mask, revealing his identity. Licht steals her sword, only to realise Lynn is also a martial artist. During their short fight she becomes so flustered by Licht\u2019s flirting he manages to escape when she closes her eyes expecting a kiss, greatly irritating her. A Lieutenant named Jail Murdoch interrogates Nana to learn Licht\u2019s whereabouts, destroying her food wagon when she tries to lie, and then setting out to hunt Licht down.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = Ballot Holder\n| TranslitTitle       = Barotto horud\u0101\n| NativeTitle         = {{Ruby-ja|\u9055\u6cd5\u6240\u6301\u8005|\u30d0\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30db\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc}}\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|1|29}}\n| ShortSummary        = Following Licht\u2019s escape Lynn continues her volunteer work but is despondent over having lost a potential promotion. However, Licht reappears so she chases him through the village where several misunderstandings lead the villagers to think she and Licht are having a lover\u2019s quarrel and Licht escapes again when she complains about her uniform always exposing her underwear. Hina decides she must warn Licht about Lieutenant Murdoch but cannot as they must first rebuild Nana\u2019s wagon. Licht wonders about the villagers who seem more interested in living peacefully than helping catch criminals. Lynn keeps being distracted from chasing him by the villager\u2019s problems and Licht comes to admire her, revealing himself again so Lynn can enjoy continuing to chase him. Licht suddenly saves Lynn from being hurt when Murdoch and his soldiers attack him. Murdoch\u2019s number is revealed to be 900, along with his Ballot that allows him to create iron weapons, hence his nickname \"Iron Jail\". Licht is surprisingly overwhelmed and Murdoch reveals he keeps his real number hidden from his superiors to avoid a promotion that would put him behind a desk in an office instead of hunting criminals. His true number is 12,500, over twice Licht\u2019s number.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Don't Apologize, Apologize\n| TranslitTitle       = Ayamaruna, ayamare\n| NativeTitle         = \u8b1d\u308b\u306a\u3001\u8b1d\u308c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|2|5}}\n| ShortSummary        = Murdoch succeeds in taking Licht\u2019s sword but gives it back. He reveals his number represents his convictions, and that his iron weapons are strengthened by his convictions, and have never been cut. He traps Licht so Licht surrenders. Murdoch accuses Licht of once being a soldier, based on his fighting style. When Licht refuses to answer Murdoch decides to torture him, but Lynn steps in and is injured. Murdoch, disgusted by Lynn\u2019s failure to punish criminals in favour of her charity work, berates her. Lynn almost apologises, until Licht stops her. He breaks free from his restraints, revealing he was always capable of breaking the Murdochs iron. As he and Murdoch unleash their true powers Licht demands he apologise for assuming Lynn is lazy when she constantly works harder than everyone. Their fight collapses a cliff, sending Lynn falling, and a repentant Murdoch tries to catch her, but Licht catches her first. He manages to insult her, angering her, causing his count to decrease to negative 1001. He then passes her to Murdoch who lets him escape. Realising Licht was right Murdoch creates a play area for the village\u2019s children from his iron, deciding to give Licht a 3 day head start before resuming his search, with Lynn joining him. As he reluctantly fixes a child\u2019s broken doll his 12500 decreases to 12499 for giving up his conviction to catch Licht.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| Title               = Hunch\n| TranslitTitle       = Kan\n| NativeTitle         = \u52d8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|2|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = Licht is found by Hina and Nana and learns that after his fight against \u201cIron Jail\u201d Murdoch, all the roads have been blocked. Hina appears jealous Licht was fighting for another woman and scolds him for leaving her behind. Licht is forced to save a girl named Pelmo from falling to her death in an experimental [[Biplane|aeroplane]]. Pelmo asks Licht and Hina to help make her dream of flight come true, even though researching flight is a crime punishable by death. Licht modifies her latest design, but worries he has only put her in danger, despite Hina praising him. Hina asks what Licht\u2019s dream is, but he refuses to reveal it, instead claiming it is to see her panties. Pelmo interrupts, having finished the new aeroplane. Soldiers arrive and Licht is forced to destroy the aeroplane. The soldiers leave after being convinced the wings were broken windmill sails. An abyss suddenly opens up and Pelmo reveals her count was based on her dreams coming true, but it went down each time her aeroplanes failed to fly, and now it has reached 0. Hina tries to save her, but the abyss fights back. Licht tries to save Hina, but when the abyss hits his sword he suffers a violent flashback. Pelmo happily enters the abyss, convinced it is not death but the door to another world, and promises to see them again one day.

Nana arranges a cooking battle between Lynn and Hina to draw in customers, with Licht as the prize. Lynn buys vegetables while Hina traps wild beasts, showing she is intimidatingly skilled at killing dangerous animals. Lynn creates a vegetable stew while Hina creates a meat stew with a deadly aura. Licht enjoys both but while Hina\u2019s is clearly superior Licht is put on the spot when the crowd demands he choose a winner. He is saved from having to disappoint one of them when Murdoch arrives and berates Lynn for being distracted again. Licht threatens to run away, placing the blame on Murdoch instead of Lynn. After a short fight Nana steps in and berates them both for acting like children and damaging the town square. Surprisingly, even Murdoch is overwhelmed by her forceful personality and does as she says, even joining in the festivities. The next morning Murdoch, Lynn and Pele awaken, hung-over, with Nana, Licht and Hina having snuck away during the night.

Murdoch insists it must be a ballot holder with fire abilities. Lynn and Pele take the soldier for treatment in the next town where they find Licht, Hina and Nana. Murdoch confronts Licht, convinced he knows something. Nana angrily bans them from fighting, so instead they have a drinking contest. Murdoch drunkenly accuses Licht of being the Legendary Ace and demands to know why the army are looking for him. Licht provokes Murdoch into drinking even more while Nana decides to join in too. Lynn becomes tipsy after only one glass and asks Hina what her relationship with Licht is. Licht and Murdoch eventually pass out. Both Lynn and Hina try to let Licht use their laps as a pillow. The lake abyss suddenly appears, destroying part of the town, and begins emanating a strange noise. Murdoch orders the civilians evacuated while Licht recognises the sound. He claims the sound is impossible as all such demons were defeated during the Waste War. He and Murdoch watch as the abyss opens and the demon is revealed to be a modern helicopter armed with machine guns and missiles.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Plunderer\n| TranslitTitle       = Purandara\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|3|4}}\n| ShortSummary        =  The helicopter attacks and Licht tells everyone to take cover but Murdoch resists Licht taking command.

Everyone begins cheering as Licht attacks the helicopter but the abyss stops him. Lynn reveals the military calls the abyss\u2019 arms Althing. Althing tries to grab the helicopter while Licht attacks Althing but is shocked by it repeatedly. Hina asks Murdoch to help but he refuses as attacking Althing is punishable by execution and he will not let anyone break the law. However Murdoch \u201caccidentally\u201d loses his glasses. Unable to see any laws being broken Murdoch attacks Althing and the soldiers all coincidentally go blind as well. They create a ladder for Licht to reach the helicopter but he is shocked after seeing inside the cockpit. The helicopter is suddenly shot down by the homicidally insane \"Ace of Pursuit\" Sonohara Mizuka, who possesses the number 32,000. She shoots Murdoch and begins murdering everybody, revealing she is obsessed with following the last order Licht gave her during the Waste War, to kill everybody. Sonohara reveals Licht\u2019s real name is Rihito and she wants him to revert to his former bloodthirsty personality and kill her, or she will murder a nearby child. Licht snaps and kills her men so fast their bodies simply disappear. Licht finally answers Hina and Murdoch\u2019s questions of who he is.

A red power violently erupts from Licht, increasing the count on his sword to 57,000, and he begins moving so fast Sonohara cannot see him. Nana reveals that Licht has been taken over by an evil alternate personality called Schmelman. Schmelman defeats Sonohara and her count drops to 16,000, causing Nana to suspect Sonohara had also been under the influence of an evil personality. Based on her knowledge of Licht\u2019s past Nana explains Sonohara was actually the kindest of the Aces who never killed anyone, but someone must have drugged her to fight Licht, hoping Schmelman would emerge. Hina desperately hugs him so Schmelman almost kills her, but Sonohara saves her. As Schmelman moves to kill Sonohara, she has a flashback to modern Japan, when she and Licht were in high school together. Schmelman is stopped by Murdoch, who challenges him despite the bullet in his chest. As they duel Schmelman begins to cry and claims he kills enemies so his friends won\u2019t have to. Deciding to honour this Murdoch fights with all his power and creates an iron warrior which knocks Schmelman unconscious, turning him back into Licht. Murdoch passes out from his injury.

Murdoch is summoned by Supreme Commander Alexandrov Gregorovich, his childish but doting adoptive father. Murdoch demands to know about Sonohara\u2019s soldiers who wore black uniforms. Gregorovich reveals they are the Special Services Unit, or SSU, that serves the Royal family as spies, kidnappers and assassins. Concerning Licht Gregorovich reveals the Aces were surgically altered human weapons for the Waste Wars, and Licht was the strongest member of the strongest squad. A side effect of the surgery caused the Aces to stop aging, explaining Licht still being alive. Gregorovich suddenly reveals he knows Murdoch\u2019s number has dropped to 12,499 and demands to know if he knows Licht\u2019s location. Murdoch lies, and it drops to 12,498 so Gregorovich reveals he also knows that attacked Althing. Murdoch returns to finally arrest Licht, who decides to surrender. A nearby spy reveals they want Licht to continue plundering. Licht asks Murdoch several questions to determine if he is being blackmailed and Murdoch lies repeatedly, dropping his number to 12,496, before trying to arrest Licht. Nana reveals she herself is an Ace and, with an unexplained power, sends Murdoch, Hina, Pele and Lynn to modern Japan, begging them to change the past where she failed.

The Headmaster, Major Schmelman, who begins by reading his version of the Tortoise and the Hare, then having Alan shoot three recruits who laughed. Rihito takes Schmelman hostage so Schmelman teaches Rihito how to break his neck, but Rihito refuses and instead offers to die in Hina\u2019s place, ignoring Schmelman\u2019s intense killing aura. Firenda calms the situation by revealing the recruits are alive as Alan had used paint bullets to make a point about obeying orders. Schmelman takes an interest in Rihito\u2019s potential while Murdoch is confused that Rihito is clearly a young Licht, yet looks nothing like his future self at all. Pele tries to research Althing on a computer but is blocked. Instead Alan explains Althing was a super advanced technology of unknown origin that fell to earth in the middle of the war. It had the power to force all humans to obey its will following a vote, so humanity voted to destroy nuclear weaponry and ban all war, however, this had unintended consequences that Alan refuses to talk about. Murdoch begins to suspect Nana not only wants them to help Licht, she wants them to discover the true origin or Althing and save their future society.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = Full Stomach\n| TranslitTitle       = Haraippai\n| NativeTitle         = \u8179\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}\n| ShortSummary        = Schmelman decides to instruct everyone personally. Alan spies on them and overhears them talk about the Abyss, ballots and the country of Alcia. Schmelman gives students 2 stars, explaining students who gather 10 join the military straight away, but anyone who loses them is expelled. Stars are earned by performing tasks or stealing from classmates. Murdoch and Hina realise this is the origin of Star Stakes. Rihito is given no stars and told to steal one or be expelled. Licht claims not to care as he is only there to convince his adopted brother, Sakai Tokikaze, to return home. Doan, the delinquent, breaks into people\u2019s lockers and steals their stars, including Sakai\u2019s, threatening Sakai\u2019s grandmother when he resists, as Doan\u2019s parents are her landlords. To prevent expulsion everyone shares their stars but none is left for Sakai. Sakai refuses to return home because soldier\u2019s families get more food and their grandmother is already ill from malnutrition. Murdoch gives Sakai his remaining star then confronts Doan just outside the gate, warning him the moment Doan leaves academy property he will cripple him before his military career even begins. Schmelman interrupts and it is revealed Rihito pickpocketed Doan\u2019s stolen stars, leaving him with only two and unable to graduate yet. For his loyalty to his classmates Schmelman gives Murdoch two stars. Rihito keeps two stars and decides to stay to convince Sakai to return home, reasoning that as long as they are at the academy they can send their own food rations to their grandmother.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 14\n| Title               = 7 Minutes 12 Seconds\n| TranslitTitle       = Nana fun j\u016bni by\u014d\n| NativeTitle         = 7\u520612\u79d2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = \n}}<!--\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 15\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}-->\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 17\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 18\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 19\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 20\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 21\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 22\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| Title           = \n| TranslitTitle   = \n| NativeTitle     = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ShortSummary    = \n}}-->\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://web-ace.jp/shonenace/contents/13/|Official manga website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|http://plunderer-info.com/|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|manga|20675}}\n\n{{Geek Toys}}\n\n[[Category:2020 anime television series]]\n[[Category: Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category: Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category: Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category: Geek Toys]]\n[[Category: Kadokawa Shoten manga]]\n[[Category: Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category: Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category: Yen Press titles]]\n", "name_user": "KANLen09", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAnime", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderer_(manga)"}

The generic name combines the name of German paleontologist [[Otto Jaekel]], who described the type species, and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]&nbsp;word \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (''pteron'') meaning \"wing\".\n\nBased on the isolated fossil remains of a large [[Chelicerae|chelicera]] (claw) from the [[Klerf Formation]] of Germany, ''J. rhenaniae'' has been estimated to have reached a size of around 2.3\u20132.6 metres (7.5\u20138.5&nbsp;ft), making it the largest arthropod ever discovered, surpassing other large arthropods such as fellow eurypterids ''[[Acutiramus]]'' and ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and the millipede ''[[Arthropleura]]''. ''J. howelli'' was much smaller, reaching 80 centimetres (2.6&nbsp;ft) in length.\n\nIn overall appearance, ''Jaekelopterus'' is similar to other [[pterygotid]] eurypterids, possessing a large, expanded [[telson]] (the hindmost segment of the body) and enlarged pincers and forelimbs. Both species of ''Jaekelopterus'' were first described as species of the closely related ''Pterygotus'' but were raised as a separate genus based on an observed difference in the genital appendage. Though this feature has since proved to be a misidentification, other features distinguishing the genus from its relatives have been identified, including a telson with a triangular shape and a different inclination of the denticles of the claws.\n\nThe chelicerae and [[compound eyes]] of ''Jaekelopterus'' indicate it was active and powerful with high [[visual acuity]], most likely an [[apex predator]] in the ecosystems of Early Devonian [[Euramerica]]. Although eurypterids such as ''Jaekelopterus'' are often called \"sea scorpions\", the strata in which ''Jaekelopterus'' fossils have been found suggest that it lived in fresh water environments.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Jaekelopterus rhenaniae reconstruction.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of how ''Jaekelopterus'' would have appeared in life|Restoration of ''J. rhenaniae'']]\n''Jaekelopterus'' is the largest known eurypterid and the largest known [[arthropod]] to have ever existed. This was determined based on a [[Chelicerae|chelicera]] (claw) from the [[Emsian]] [[Klerf Formation]] of Willwerath, [[Germany]], that measures {{convert|36.4|cm|in}} long, but is missing a quarter of its length, suggesting that the full chelicera would have been {{convert|45.5|cm|in}} long. If the ratio of body length to chelicera length matches those of other giant [[Pterygotidae|pterygotids]], such as ''[[Acutiramus]]'' and ''[[Pterygotus]]'', where the ratio between claw size and body length is relatively consistent, the organism that possessed the chelicera would have measured between {{convert|233|and|259|cm|ft}} in length. With the chelicerae extended, another metre would be added to this length.

Unlike many arthropods, such as [[insect]]s and crustaceans, chelicerates (the group to which eurypterids like ''Jaekelopterus'' belongs, alongside other organisms such as [[horseshoe crab]]s, [[sea spider]]s and [[arachnid]]s) are generally direct developers, meaning that there are no extreme morphological changes after they have hatched. Extant [[xiphosura]]ns hatch without the full complement of adult opisthosomal appendages (appendages attached to the [[opisthosoma]], the posterior segments of the body), but extant [[spider]]s are fully direct developers. Studies of fossil specimens of ''Strobilopterus'' and ''Jaekelopterus'' suggest that the ontogeny of eurypterids broadly parallelled that of modern horseshoe crabs, but that eurypterids (like arachnids) were true direct developers, hatching with the same number of appendages and segments as adults.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThough several fossilised instars of ''Jaekelopterus howelli'' are known, the fragmentary and incomplete status of the specimens makes it difficult to study its ontogeny in detail. Despite this, there are some noticeable changes occurring in the chelicerae, telson and metastoma. Four of the ''J. howelli'' specimens studied by Lamsdell and Selden (2013) preserve the chelicerae in enough detail to allow for study of the denticles. Two of these chelicerae were assumed to come from juveniles and two were assumed to be from adults. The morphology of the chelicerae is similar across all ages, with the same arrangement and number of denticles, but there were also some noticeable differences. Particularly, the principal denticles grew in size relative to the intermediate denticles, being 1.5 times the size of the intermediate denticles in juveniles, but up to 3.5 times the size of the intermediate denticles in adults. Furthermore, the terminal denticle was far larger and more robust in adult specimens than in juveniles. Perhaps most extreme of all, the second intermediate denticle is not different in size from the other intermediate denticles in juveniles, but it is massively elongated in adults, where it is more than twice the length of any principal denticle.<ref name=\":0\" /> Though such growth in the denticles of pterygotids has been described in other genera, the massive elongation of the second intermediate denticle through ontogeny is unique to ''Jaekelopterus'', particularly to ''J. howelli''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe metastoma of ''Jaekelopterus'' also altered its dimensions as the animal matured. In ''J. rhenaniae'', the relative width of the metastoma decreased through ontogeny.

Fossils of ''Jaekelopterus'' have been discovered in deposits of [[Early Devonian]] age, from the [[Pragian]] and [[Emsian]] stages. There are two known species: the type species ''J. rhenaniae'' from [[Brackish water|brackish]] to [[fresh water]] strata in the [[Rhineland]], and ''J. howelli'' from [[Estuary|estuarine]] strata in [[Wyoming]]. The generic name combines the name of German paleontologist [[Otto Jaekel]], who described the type species, and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]&nbsp;word \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (''pteron'') meaning \"wing\".\n\nBased on the isolated fossil remains of a large [[Chelicerae|chelicera]] (claw) from the [[Klerf Formation]] of Germany, ''J. rhenaniae'' has been estimated to have reached a size of around 2.3\u20132.6 metres (7.5\u20138.5&nbsp;ft), making it the largest arthropod ever discovered, surpassing other large arthropods such as fellow eurypterids ''[[Acutiramus]]'' and ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and the millipede ''[[Arthropleura]]''. ''J. howelli'' was much smaller, reaching 80 centimetres (2.6&nbsp;ft) in length.\n\nIn overall appearance, ''Jaekelopterus'' is similar to other [[pterygotid]] eurypterids, possessing a large, expanded [[telson]] (the hindmost segment of the body) and enlarged pincers and forelimbs. Both species of ''Jaekelopterus'' were first described as species of the closely related ''Pterygotus'' but were raised as a separate genus based on an observed difference in the genital appendage. Though this feature has since proved to be a misidentification, other features distinguishing the genus from its relatives have been identified, including a telson with a triangular shape and a different inclination of the denticles of the claws.\n\nThe chelicerae and [[compound eyes]] of ''Jaekelopterus'' indicate it was active and powerful with high [[visual acuity]], most likely an [[apex predator]] in the ecosystems of Early Devonian [[Euramerica]]. Although eurypterids such as ''Jaekelopterus'' are often called \"sea scorpions\", the strata in which ''Jaekelopterus'' fossils have been found suggest that it lived in fresh water environments.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Jaekelopterus rhenaniae reconstruction.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Image of how ''Jaekelopterus'' would have appeared in life|Restoration of ''J. rhenaniae'']]\n''Jaekelopterus'' is the largest known eurypterid and the largest known [[arthropod]] to have ever existed.

If the ratio of body length to chelicera length matches those of other giant [[Pterygotidae|pterygotids]], such as ''[[Acutiramus]]'' and ''[[Pterygotus]]'', where the ratio between claw size and body length is relatively consistent, the organism that possessed the chelicera would have measured between {{convert|233|and|259|cm|ft}} in length. With the chelicerae extended, another metre would be added to this length.

Lamsdell and Legg concluded that an inclusive phylogenetic analysis with multiple species of ''Acutiramus'', ''Pterygotus'' and ''Jaekelopterus'' is required to resolve whether the genera are synonyms of each other.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe [[cladogram]] below is based on the nine best-known pterygotid species and two outgroup taxa (''[[Slimonia|Slimonia acuminata]]'' and ''[[Hughmilleria|Hughmilleria socialis]]''). ''Jaekelopterus'' had previously been classified as a basal sister taxon to the rest of the Pterygotidae since its description as a separate genus by Waterston in 1964 due to its supposedly segmented genital appendages (fused and undivided in other pterygotids), but restudy of the specimens in question revealed that the genital appendage of ''Jaekelopterus'' also was undivided. The material examined and phylogenetic analysis conducted by British palaeontologist Simon J. Braddy, German palaeontologist Markus Poschmann and O.

Several factors have been suggested that might have contributed to the unprecedented large size of ''Jaekelopterus'', its relatives and other large [[Paleozoic]] invertebrates, such as predation, courtship behaviour, competition and environmental resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Briggs|first=Derek|date=1985|title=Gigantism in Palaeozoic arthropods|url=|journal=Special Papers in Palaeontology|volume=33|pages=157|via=}}</ref>\n\nFactors such as respiration, the energy costs of [[moulting]], locomotion and the actual properties of the exoskeleton restrict the size of arthropods.<ref name=\"Braddy\" /> Other than the robust and heavily sclerotised claws, most of the preserved large body segments of the pterygotids are thin and unmineralised. Even tergites and [[sternites]] (the plates that form the surfaces of the abdominal segments) are generally preserved as paper-thin compressions, suggesting that pterygotids were very lightweight in construction.<ref name=\"Braddy\" /> Similar lightweight adaptations can be observed in other Paleozoic giant arthropods, such as the giant millipede-like ''[[Arthropleura]]'', and it has been suggested to be vital for the evolution of giant arthropod sizes.<ref>Kraus, O., Brauckmann, C.

'''A''' is a juvenile free ramus, '''B''' is an adult free ramus and '''C'''\u2013'''D''' are articulated and fixed free rami from adults.|left]]\nLike all other arthropods, eurypterids matured through a sequence of stages called \"[[instar]]s\" consisting of periods of [[ecdysis]] (moulting) followed by rapid growth. Unlike many arthropods, such as [[insect]]s and crustaceans, chelicerates (the group to which eurypterids like ''Jaekelopterus'' belongs, alongside other organisms such as [[horseshoe crab]]s, [[sea spider]]s and [[arachnid]]s) are generally direct developers, meaning that there are no extreme morphological changes after they have hatched. Extant [[xiphosura]]ns hatch without the full complement of adult opisthosomal appendages (appendages attached to the [[opisthosoma]], the posterior segments of the body), but extant [[spider]]s are fully direct developers. Studies of fossil specimens of ''Strobilopterus'' and ''Jaekelopterus'' suggest that the ontogeny of eurypterids broadly parallelled that of modern horseshoe crabs, but that eurypterids (like arachnids) were true direct developers, hatching with the same number of appendages and segments as adults.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThough several fossilised instars of ''Jaekelopterus howelli'' are known, the fragmentary and incomplete status of the specimens makes it difficult to study its ontogeny in detail. Despite this, there are some noticeable changes occurring in the chelicerae, telson and metastoma. Four of the ''J. howelli'' specimens studied by Lamsdell and Selden (2013) preserve the chelicerae in enough detail to allow for study of the denticles. Two of these chelicerae were assumed to come from juveniles and two were assumed to be from adults. The morphology of the chelicerae is similar across all ages, with the same arrangement and number of denticles, but there were also some noticeable differences. Particularly, the principal denticles grew in size relative to the intermediate denticles, being 1.5 times the size of the intermediate denticles in juveniles, but up to 3.5 times the size of the intermediate denticles in adults. Furthermore, the terminal denticle was far larger and more robust in adult specimens than in juveniles. Perhaps most extreme of all, the second intermediate denticle is not different in size from the other intermediate denticles in juveniles, but it is massively elongated in adults, where it is more than twice the length of any principal denticle.<ref name=\":0\" /> Though such growth in the denticles of pterygotids has been described in other genera, the massive elongation of the second intermediate denticle through ontogeny is unique to ''Jaekelopterus'', particularly to ''J. howelli''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe metastoma of ''Jaekelopterus'' also altered its dimensions as the animal matured. In ''J. rhenaniae'', the relative width of the metastoma decreased through ontogeny. The metastoma in ''J. howelli'' is also broader in juveniles than in adults, although the length\u2013width ratios measured in juveniles and adults were not as disparate as assumed, being 1.43 in juveniles and 1.46 in adults.<ref name=\":0\" /> Such a change in metastomal dimensions has been noted in other eurypterid genera as well, such as ''[[Stoermeropterus]]'', ''[[Moselopterus]]'' and ''[[Strobilopterus]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Palaeoecology ==\n\n=== Lifestyle and environment ===\n[[File:Jaekelopterus howelli.jpg|thumb|Fossil chelicerae of ''J. howelli''.]]\nThe morphology and body construction of ''Jaekelopterus'' and other eurypterids in the Pterygotidae suggests they were adapted to a completely aquatic lifestyle. Braddy, Poschmann and Tetlie considered in a 2007 study that it was highly unlikely that an arthropod with the size and build of ''Jaekelopterus'' would be able to walk on land.<ref name=\"Braddy\" /> Eurypterids such as ''Jaekelopterus'' are often popularly referred to as \"sea scorpions\", but the deposits from which ''Jaekelopterus'' fossils have been discovered suggest that it lived in non-marine aquatic environments. The Beartooth Butte Formation in Wyoming, where ''J. howelli'' fossils have been discovered, has been interpreted as a quiet, shallow [[estuarine]] environment.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fossil sites yielding ''J. rhenaniae'' in the Rhineland have also been interpreted as having been part of a shallow aquatic environment with [[Brackish water|brackish]] to [[fresh water]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe chelicerae of ''Jaekelopterus'' are enlarged, robust and have a curved free ramus and denticles of different lengths and sizes, all adaptations that correspond to strong puncturing and grasping abilities in extant [[scorpion]]s and crustaceans. Some puncture wounds on fossils of the [[Poraspididae|poraspid]] [[agnatha]]n fish ''[[Lechriaspis patula]]'' from the [[Devonian]] of [[Utah]] were likely caused by ''Jaekelopterus howelli''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=David K.|last2=Petriello|first2=Michael A.|date=2011|title=New poraspids (Agnatha, Heterostraci) from the Early Devonian of the western United States|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=31|issue=3|pages=518\u2013530|doi=10.1080/02724634.2011.557113}}</ref> The latest research indicates that ''Jaekelopterus'' was an active and visual predator.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Victoria E.|last2=Lamsdell|first2=James C.|last3=Poschmann|first3=Markus|last4=Anderson|first4=Ross P.|last5=Briggs|first5=Derek E.

The [[hydromechanics]] of the swimming paddles and telsons of ''Jaekelopterus'' and other pterygotids suggest that all members of the group were capable of hovering, forward locomotion and quick turns. Though they were not necessarily rapidly swimming animals, they were likely able to give chase to prey in habitats such as [[lagoon]]s and [[Estuary|estuaries]].<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Visual system ===\n[[File:Jaekelopterus eyes.png|left|thumb|Fossilised exocones (the cone-shaped lens-cylinders which make up the [[compound eye]]) of ''J. rhenaniae''.]]\nThe cheliceral morphology and [[visual acuity]] of the pterygotid eurypterids separates them into distinct ecological groups. The primary method for determining visual acuity in arthropods is by determining the number of lenses in their [[compound eyes]] and the [[Ommatidium|interommatidial angle]] (IOA), which is the angle between the optical axes of adjacent lenses. The IOA is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods, being low in modern active arthropod predators.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBoth ''Jaekelopterus rhenaniae'' and ''Pterygotus anglicus'' had high visual acuity, as suggested by the low IOA and many lenses in their compound eyes.<ref name=\":1\" /> Further studies on the compound eyes of fossilised specimens of ''J. rhenaniae'', including a large specimen with the right eye preserved from the uppermost [[Siegenian]] and a small and likely juvenile specimen, confirmed the high visual acuity of the genus. The overall average IOA of ''Jaekelopterus'' (0.87\u00b0) is comparable to that of modern predatory arthropods. The visual acuity of ''Jaekelopterus'' increased with age, the smaller specimens having relatively worse eyesight.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |last=Poschmann |first=Markus |last2=Schoenemann |first2=Brigitte |last3=McCoy|first3=Victoria E.|date=2016-03-01 |title=Telltale eyes: the lateral visual systems of Rhenish Lower Devonian eurypterids (Arthropoda, Chelicerata) and their palaeobiological implications |journal=Palaeontology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=295\u2013304 |doi=10.1111/pala.12228|issn=1475-4983}}</ref> This is consistent with other pterygotids, such as ''Acutiramus'', and has been interpreted as indicating that adult ''Jaekelopterus'' lived in darker environments, such as in deeper water.

Structurally, eurypterid eyes were almost identical to the eyes of horseshoe crabs. The square-like pattern of the receptor cells in the compound eyes of ''Jaekelopterus'' is also similar, but not identical, to the pattern in horseshoe crabs, suggesting a specialised visual system. The photoreceptors are unusually large in ''Jaekelopterus''. At around 70\u2009\u00b5m, they are far larger than those of humans (1-2 \u00b5m) and most arthropods (also 1-2 \u00b5m) but they match those of modern horseshoe crabs in size.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Schoenemann|first=Brigitte|last2=Poschmann|first2=Markus|last3=Clarkson|first3=Euan N.

(side panels); cm 45 c. \u00d7 83 c. (each section of the predella)]]\n\nThe '''''Stefaneschi Altarpiece''''' is a [[triptych]] by the Italian painter [[Giotto]] (c.\u20091267 \u2013 1337),  commissioned by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]]<ref>His name is also often found as [[:w:it:Jacopo Jacopo Caetani degli Stefaneschi|Jacopo Caetani degli Stefaneschi]].</ref> to serve as an [[altarpiece]] for one of the altars of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].\n\nIt is now at the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], Rome.\n\n==Description==\nIt is a rare example in Giotto's work of a documented commission, and includes Giotto's signature, although the date, like most dates for Giotto, is disputed, and many scholars feel the artist's workshop was responsible for its execution.<ref>Gardner, 57\u20138, gives the documentation from the obituary book of St. Peter's. Most scholars date the altarpiece to c. 1320; Gardner dates it to c. 1300; Anne Mueller von den Haegen dates it to c. 1313; Kessler dates it to between 1313 and 1320.</ref> It had long been thought to have been made for the main altar of the church; more recent research suggests that it was placed on the \"canon's altar\",  located in the [[nave]], just to the left of the huge arched opening into the [[transept]].<ref>Kempers and De Blaauw, 88\u201389; Kessler, 91\u201392.  See a drawing reconstructing the location of the altar in Kempers and De Blaauw.  These authors believe the figure of Christ was on the front of the altarpiece, the figure of St. Peter on the back.</ref> The [[altar]] was freestanding, and the altarpiece is painted on both sides so it could be seen by the congregation from the front and the canons of the church from the back.\n\nThe central front panel represents [[Saint Peter]] enthroned, flanked by saints, with Cardinal Stefaneschi himself kneeling at Peter's right offering up this altarpiece in reduced size.  Saints [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[St. Paul|Paul]] are in the left panel and [[John the Evangelist]] and [[St. Andrew|Andrew]] are in the right. Two of the three predella panels are lost, but they surely all represented half-length figures of saints. The back main (central) panel represents Christ enthroned flanked by angels with a kneeling Cardinal Stefaneschi at his right foot.  In the left panel we see the crucifixion of Peter, and on the right is the beheading of St. Paul. The predella depicts the [[Virgin and Child]] flanked by angels in the center and standing figures of the 12 apostles at the sides.\n\nThe altarpiece stood before the apse of Old St. Peter's, which in the 14th century contained a mosaic of Christ enthroned between Saints. Peter & Paul.  Thus the iconography of the front of the painting paralleled the apse mosaic in form but did not repeat it in iconography.  The central panel of the back of the altarpiece duplicated the apse mosaic for those who could not see it (because they sat with their backs to it), while the side panels introduced narratives. It was normal for double-sided altarpieces in this period to have an iconic image on the front and narrative images on the back.<ref>Gardner, 62\u201363.</ref>  Peter echoes Christ's pose to emphasize the role of the pope (Peter was the first pope) as Christ's representative on earth.<ref>Paoletti & Radke, 66; Kessler, 93.</ref>\n\n[[File:Polittico Stefaneschi, dettaglio.jpg|thumb|270px|Front detail: Cardinal Giacomo Stefaneschi]]\nGiotto represents the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul as taking place in recognizable locales, frequently visited by pilgrims to Rome. Peter's crucifixion is placed between the ''[[Meta Romuli]]'' (a [[pyramid]] near the Vatican, destroyed in the 15th century) and the [[obelisk]] that came from Nero's [[Circus]],  while Paul's beheading is outside the city, near a round building that symbolizes the saint's prison.  These scenes could also be found in the medieval frescoes on the walls of the nave of Old St. Peter's.<ref>Kessler, 92\u201393.</ref>).  Although images of donors in church decorations in Rome went back to the Early Christian period, Giotto's altarpiece for St. Peter's is unusual in both the double representation of the donor (front and back) and the specificity of the face and costume of Cardinal Stefaneschi.  Stefaneschi is dressed in full ceremonial costume as a cardinal on the front, appropriate for the \"public\" face of the altarpiece and is introduced to St. Peter by St. George.  On the back, he is more modestly dressed as a canon, like the audience for this side of the painting. [[Vasari]] cited portraiture as one of the greatest strengths of Giotto's art.<ref>Maginnis, 386\u2013390.</ref>\n\nThe depiction of Stefaneschi holding this very painting suggests that it originally had a significantly more elaborate frame, which would have made the relatively small altarpiece fit better into the large space that was Old St. Peter's. The characteristic of containing a smaller version of itself provides one of the earliest known Renaissance examples of the so-called \"[[Droste effect]]\", common in medieval art.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{commons category|Stefaneschi triptych}}\n*Boskovits, Miklos, \"Giotto a Roma\", ''Arte Cristiana'', 88 (2000) 171\u2013180.\n*Gardner, Julian, \"The Stefaneschi Altarpiece: A Reconsideration\",  ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'',  Vol. 37, (1974), pp.&nbsp;57\u2013103.\n*Gosebruch, M., \"Giottos Stefaneschi-Altarwerk aus Alt-St. Peter in Rom\",  ''Miscellanea Bibliotecae Hertzianae'', Munich, 1961, 101\u2013130.\n*von den Haegen, Anne Mueller, ''Giotto di Bondone'', trans.
