When Clairol sales representatives gave a live demonstration of Miss Clairol at the International Beauty Show in New York City, thousands of [[hairdresser]]s and [[beautician]]s gathered to watch. [[Bruce Gelb]] (son of Lawrence and Joan, and a former Clairol executive) described the scene in a ''New Yorker'' article: \"They were astonished. This was to the world of hair color what computers were to the world of adding machines. The sales guys had to bring buckets of water and do the rinsing off in front of everyone, because the hairdressers in the crowd were convinced we were doing something to the models behind the scenes\".<ref name=Gladwell>{{cite web|url=http://www.gladwell.com/1999/1999_03_22_a_colors.html |title=True Colors |author=Malcolm Gladwell |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505050024/http://gladwell.com/1999/1999_03_22_a_colors.html |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |work=New Yorker article reprint |date=March 22, 1999 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, after two decades of selling the company's hair tint to beauty salons, Clairol launched an at-home version of Miss Clairol Hair Color Bath and became a household name. The successful advertising campaign used to promote the new version of the product used the [[catchphrase]], \"Does she...or doesn't she? Only her hairdresser knows for sure\". Within six years of Miss Clairol's launch, 70% of women were coloring their hair.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1957, the Gelbs sold their company to Bristol-Myers. Sons Bruce and [[Richard L. Gelb]] filled executive positions at the [[pharmaceutical]] company; Richard became chief executive officer in 1972. Bristol-Myers merged with Squibb Corporation to form [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], and Richard Gelb remained the merged company's CEO until 1993. Procter & Gamble purchased the Clairol division from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2001 for $4.95&nbsp;billion.\n\n== Advertising history ==\nClairol's one-step home hair color was a breakthrough in the beauty industry, as was its [[advertising]] campaign. Clairol hired the advertising firm [[Foote, Cone & Belding]], which assigned the account to a junior copywriter ([[Shirley Polykoff]], the only female copywriter at the firm). Polykoff's future mother-in-law inspired the \"Does she...or doesn't she?\" slogan. After meeting Polykoff for the first time, she took her son aside and asked him about the true color of his girlfriend's hair. \"Does she color her hair, or doesn't she?\" the embarrassed Polykoff could imagine her mother-in-law-to-be asking. Although Polykoff did color her hair, the practice was not something to which women openly admitted during the Depression (when her future mother-in-law first asked the question). In 1956 (when Polykoff was assigned the Clairol campaign), hair dye was still considered something not used by genteel women.\n\nTo counter the stigma of hair color and create a wholesome, sentimental image for Clairol, early print ads\u2014some of which were shot by fashion photographers [[Richard Avedon]] and [[Irving Penn]]\u2014featured girl-next-door models accompanied by children with hair the same color. \"Does she...or doesn't she?\" became an effective slogan; within six years, 70% of all adult women were coloring their hair, and Clairol's sales increased fourfold. In 1967, Polykoff was inducted into the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]].\n\nThe company's \"If I've only one life to live, let me live it as a blonde\" slogan was recorded for the ad campaign by actress [[Rosemary Rice]].<ref name=nca>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Obituary: Rosemary Rice Merrell, 87, started in TV and radio |url=http://www.ncadvertiser.com/11179/obituary-rosemary-rice-merrell-87-started-in-tv-and-radio/ |work=[[New Canaan Advertiser]] |publisher=|date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> The company achieved notoriety in the late 1990s and early 2000s for its ads for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo. Said as \"a totally organic experience\", the ads often featured women washing their hair and making sounds similar to those of someone having an [[orgasm]].\n\n== {{anchor|More catchphrases}}Additional slogans ==\nClairol continued to market its hair-color products with advertising slogans. As early as 1956 and during the 1960s, ads for Lady Clairol asked, \"Is it true blondes have more fun?\"; those for Loving Care asked, \"What would your husband do if suddenly you looked ten years younger?\" When the company introduced Nice 'n Easy, the first at-home shampoo-in hair color, women were told, \"The closer he gets, the better you look\". Radiantly Red was advertised with \"Some lucky girls are born red. Others catch up\". Clairol's \"Does she...or doesn't she?\" legacy continues; it was one of the brand campaigns featured in 2008's \"The Real Men and Women of Madison Avenue and Their Impact on American Culture\" exhibit at the [[New York Public Library]]'s Science, Industry and Business Library.\n\n==Popular references==\nAccording to writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]], Clairol captured the [[Feminism|feminist]] sensibilities of the day with a shampoo-in hair color and memorable advertising slogans. Author of [[social psychology]] bestsellers (''[[The Tipping Point]]'' and ''[[Blink (book)|Blink]]''), Gladwell wrote in \"True Colors\" (a 1999 ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker]]'' history of hair dye), \"In writing the [[history of women]] in the [[postwar]] era, did we forget something important?

When Clairol sales representatives gave a live demonstration of Miss Clairol at the International Beauty Show in New York City, thousands of [[hairdresser]]s and [[beautician]]s gathered to watch. [[Bruce Gelb]] (son of Lawrence and Joan, and a former Clairol executive) described the scene in a ''New Yorker'' article: \"They were astonished. This was to the world of hair color what computers were to the world of adding machines. The sales guys had to bring buckets of water and do the rinsing off in front of everyone, because the hairdressers in the crowd were convinced we were doing something to the models behind the scenes\".<ref name=Gladwell>{{cite web|url=http://www.gladwell.com/1999/1999_03_22_a_colors.html |title=True Colors |author=Malcolm Gladwell |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505050024/http://gladwell.com/1999/1999_03_22_a_colors.html |archivedate=May 5, 2012 |work=New Yorker article reprint |date=March 22, 1999 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, after two decades of selling the company's hair tint to beauty salons, Clairol launched an at-home version of Miss Clairol Hair Color Bath and became a household name. The successful advertising campaign used to promote the new version of the product used the [[catchphrase]], \"Does she...or doesn't she? Only her hairdresser knows for sure\". Within six years of Miss Clairol's launch, 70% of women were coloring their hair.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1957, the Gelbs sold their company to Bristol-Myers. Sons Bruce and [[Richard L. Gelb]] filled executive positions at the [[pharmaceutical]] company; Richard became chief executive officer in 1972. Bristol-Myers merged with Squibb Corporation to form [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], and Richard Gelb remained the merged company's CEO until 1993. Procter & Gamble purchased the Clairol division from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2001 for $4.95&nbsp;billion.\n\n== Advertising history ==\nClairol's one-step home hair color was a breakthrough in the beauty industry, as was its [[advertising]] campaign. Clairol hired the advertising firm [[Foote, Cone & Belding]], which assigned the account to a junior copywriter ([[Shirley Polykoff]], the only female copywriter at the firm). Polykoff's future mother-in-law inspired the \"Does she...or doesn't she?\" slogan. After meeting Polykoff for the first time, she took her son aside and asked him about the true color of his girlfriend's hair. \"Does she color her hair, or doesn't she?\" the embarrassed Polykoff could imagine her mother-in-law-to-be asking. Although Polykoff did color her hair, the practice was not something to which women openly admitted during the Depression (when her future mother-in-law first asked the question). In 1956 (when Polykoff was assigned the Clairol campaign), hair dye was still considered something not used by genteel women.\n\nTo counter the stigma of hair color and create a wholesome, sentimental image for Clairol, early print ads\u2014some of which were shot by fashion photographers [[Richard Avedon]] and [[Irving Penn]]\u2014featured girl-next-door models accompanied by children with hair the same color. \"Does she...or doesn't she?\" became an effective slogan; within six years, 70% of all adult women were coloring their hair, and Clairol's sales increased fourfold. In 1967, Polykoff was inducted into the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]].\n\nThe company's \"If I've only one life to live, let me live it as a blonde\" slogan was recorded for the ad campaign by actress [[Rosemary Rice]].<ref name=nca>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Obituary: Rosemary Rice Merrell, 87, started in TV and radio |url=http://www.ncadvertiser.com/11179/obituary-rosemary-rice-merrell-87-started-in-tv-and-radio/ |work=[[New Canaan Advertiser]] |publisher=|date=2012-08-21 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}</ref> The company achieved notoriety in the late 1990s and early 2000s for its ads for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo. Said as \"a totally organic experience\", the ads often featured women washing their hair and making sounds similar to those of someone having an [[orgasm]].\n\n== {{anchor|More catchphrases}}Additional slogans ==\nClairol continued to market its hair-color products with advertising slogans. As early as 1956 and during the 1960s, ads for Lady Clairol asked, \"Is it true blondes have more fun?\"; those for Loving Care asked, \"What would your husband do if suddenly you looked ten years younger?\" When the company introduced Nice 'n Easy, the first at-home shampoo-in hair color, women were told, \"The closer he gets, the better you look\". Radiantly Red was advertised with \"Some lucky girls are born red. Others catch up\". Clairol's \"Does she...or doesn't she?\" legacy continues; it was one of the brand campaigns featured in 2008's \"The Real Men and Women of Madison Avenue and Their Impact on American Culture\" exhibit at the [[New York Public Library]]'s Science, Industry and Business Library.\n\n==Popular references==\nAccording to writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]], Clairol captured the [[Feminism|feminist]] sensibilities of the day with a shampoo-in hair color and memorable advertising slogans. Author of [[social psychology]] bestsellers (''[[The Tipping Point]]'' and ''[[Blink (book)|Blink]]''), Gladwell wrote in \"True Colors\" (a 1999 ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker]]'' history of hair dye), \"In writing the [[history of women]] in the [[postwar]] era, did we forget something important? Did we leave out hair?\".<ref name=Gladwell/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.clairol.com/ Clairol Hair Color]\n\n[[Category:Hair care products]]\n[[Category:Former Procter & Gamble brands]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Fairfield County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1931]]\n[[Category:Coty, Inc.]]\n[[Category:Bristol-Myers Squibb]]\n[[Category:1959 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:2001 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:2016 mergers and acquisitions]]\n", "name_user": "Kenneth Shabby", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e{{anchor|Corporate history}}Corporate timeline", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairol"}

It was originally formed as part of the [[East India Company]]'s [[Bengal Army]] in 1815, later adopting the title of the '''1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''', however, in 1947, following the [[partition of India]], it was transferred to the Indian Army and in 1950 when India became a Republic, it was redesignated as '''1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)'''. The regiment has a long history and has participated in many conflicts, including many of the colonial conflicts prior to Indian independence, as well as the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. Since 1947 the regiment has also participated in a number of campaigns against Pakistan in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] as well as undertaking peacekeeping duties as part of the [[United Nations]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n{{main|Gurkha War}}\n\nThe Gurkha War was fought between the Gorkha kings of Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] as a result of border tensions and ambitious expansionism especially into Kumaon, Garwhal and Kangra hills. Although the British East India Company's army defeated the Gorkha army led by General [[Amar Singh Thapa]], they were nevertheless impressed by the skill and courage the Gorkhas had shown during the siege of Malaun fort in [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]].<ref name=Singh2007>Singh 2007.</ref><ref name=Parker45>Parker 2005, p. 45.</ref> As a result, during the post war settlement a clause was inserted into the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] enabling the British to recruit Gorkhas.<ref name=Parker45/> On 24 April 1815 at Subathu, the East India Company formed a regiment with the survivors of Thapa's army calling it the First Nusseree Battalion.<ref group=\"Note\">The designation Nusseeree, or Nasiri, means friendly or loyal.</ref><ref>Parker 2005, p. 46.</ref> The formation of this unit marks the beginning of the history of the first Gorkha regiment.\n\n===Early campaigns===\n[[File:The Nusseree Battalion.JPG|thumb|The Nusseree Battalion later known as the ''1st Gurkha Rifles'' circa 1857]]\n\nThe Regiment soon saw its first battle when, in 1826, it took part in the [[Jat War]] where it helped in the conquest of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]],<ref name=army/><ref name=Chappell12>Chappell 1993, p. 12.</ref> gaining it as a [[battle honour]], the first battle honour awarded to the Gurkha units. In 1846 the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] began and the Regiment was heavily involved in the conflict. It was awarded two battle honours for its involvement in the war; at the [[Battle of Aliwal]] which saw the [[Sikh]] forces, who had invaded [[British India]].<ref name=Chappell12/><ref name=Nicholson08>Nicholson 1974, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe Regiment experienced numerous names changes during the 1800s; one name change in 1850 saw it gain a new numerical designation to become the '''66th Goorkha Regiment of [[Bengal Native Infantry]]'''<ref name=army/> after the original 66th had mutinied.<ref name=Chappell12/> The Regiment saw service during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] which began in 1857. The following year Lieutenant [[John Adam Tytler]] became the first Gurkha officer to be awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), receiving it for his actions against rebels at [[Choorpoorah]].<ref>Parker 2005, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nIn 1861 the Regiment gained its present numerical designation when it became the '''1st Goorkha Regiment'''. In 1875, the Regiment, under the command of [[James Rawlins|Colonel James Sebastian Rawlins]], was sent abroad for the first time, when it took part in the effort to quell a rebellion in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the [[Perak War]]. During the conflict Captain [[George Nicolas Channer]] was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valiant actions against the Malayans.<ref name=Parker391>Parker 2005, p. 391.</ref> The Regiment took part in the [[Second Afghan War]] in 1878 where they were part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade and won the [[Theatre Honour]] \"Afghanistan 1878\u201380\".<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\nIn 1886 the Regiment became the '''1st Goorkha Light Infantry''' and a 2nd Battalion was raised in February.<ref name=Singh2007/> In 1891 the Regiment was designated a [[Rifle]] regiment when it became the '''1st Gurkha (Rifle) Regiment''' and in consequence of this the Regiment's [[Colour (flag)|Colours]] were laid up.<ref group=\"Note\">Rifle regiments by tradition did not possess Colours.</ref> The Regiment then took part in operations in [[Burma]] and the [[North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan|North-West Frontier]] campaigns in the 1890s; at [[Waziristan]] in 1894 and the [[Tirah Campaign|Tirah]] campaign in 1897.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn 1901 the Regiment's title was shortened when it became the '''1st Gurkha Rifles''' and in 1903 its title was changed once more, this time to the '''1st Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)'''.<ref name=Chappell12/> This title had been adopted to commemorate due to the significance of [[Malaun]] to the Regiment; it was where the British had decisively beaten the Gurkhas in 1815 during the [[The Gurkha War|Anglo\u2013Gurka War]] and subsequently recruited them into the Nusseree battalions. The Regiment was located near [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] when the [[1905 Kangra earthquake]] struck on 4 April, killing 20,000 people. The 1st Gurkhas themselves suffered over 60 fatalities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn 1906 its title was changed to the '''1st Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''' in honour of George, Prince of Wales (later King [[George V]]) who also became Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment that year.<ref name=Chappell12/> In 1910 King George V ascended to the throne and in consequence the title of the regiment was changed to the '''1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''',<ref name=army/> thus maintaining the Regiment's links with King George.\n\n===First World War===\nIn August 1914 the [[First World War]] began. In December, the 1st Battalion was deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France as part of the [[Sirhind Indian Infantry Brigade]], attached to [[3rd (Lahore) Division]]. The 1st Battalion's first taste of trench warfare came when they were involved in the defence of [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] shortly after. After braving a winter in the trenches, on 10 March 1915 the 1st Battalion took part in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] which lasted until 13 March. In April the Battalion took part in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], fighting in the subsidiary [[Battle of St. Julien]] which began on 24 April and concluded on 4 May. Later that month the Battalion took part in the [[Battle of Festubert]] and in September the [[Battle of Loos]] began, the last major engagement on the Western Front that the 1st Battalion took part in, before being withdrawn from the Western Front.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe Western Front was a completely different location to what the Regiment had been used to in the [[Indian subcontinent|sub-continent]] and they, as indeed did the other Indian Army troops, suffered badly during the winter months. As a result, in December 1915 it was decided that the infantry units of the [[Indian Corps]] would be withdrawn from France and sent to other theatres.<ref>Neillands 2004, p. 225.</ref> As a result, the 1st Battalion, along with the rest of the 3rd Division, was sent to [[Mesopotamia]] to take part in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign|campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] which had begun in 1914.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Sirhind Brigade was given a numerical designation, the 8th Brigade. In 1916 the 1st Gurkhas took part in a number of attempts, including the attack on [[Dujaila Redoubt]] in March, to relieve [[Siege of Kut|Kut-al-Amara]], which had been besieged by the Ottomans since 7 December 1915. Those attempts, however, failed and Kut remained under siege until it surrendered to the Ottomans on 29 April 1916.<ref>Gardner 2004, p. 324.</ref>\n\nFollowing this the Regiment took part in the Allied offensive against the Ottomans later that year; this included the effort to recapture Kut, begun in December, which was recaptured in February 1917 and the capital [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|Baghdad]] which was taken the following month. The 1st Battalion was later moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in early 1918. It was involved in the effective Allied offensive against the Ottomans in September, the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], and also saw action at the [[Battle of Sharon|Sharon]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nElsewhere, the 2nd Battalion saw service in the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] of India, gaining the Battle Honour \"North-West Frontier 1915\u201317\" in the process. In 1917 a 3rd Battalion was raised for home service in India.<ref name=Chappell12/>\n\nDuring the period that they had served on the Western Front in France the men of the 1st Gurkhas had found the conditions quite different from those that they were used to, however, they acquitted themselves commendably, performing with distinction in the many battles they took part in, proving the capability of the Gurkhas once more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The war formally ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the [[Armistice]]. The Regiment won 11 Battle Honours and 4 Theatre Honours during the war.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\n===Inter war years===\nIn 1919 the 1st and 2nd Battalions saw service during the brief [[Third Afghan War]] for which they gained the Theatre Honour \"Afghanistan 1919\".<ref name=Chappell13/> In 1921 the 3rd Battalion was disbanded.<ref name=Chappell12/> After this the Regiment participated in a number of campaigns on the North-West Frontier, serving mainly in Waziristan.<ref>Chappell 1993, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1937 the Regiment's name was altered slightly when it became the '''1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)'''; the only change being the addition of a V.<ref name=Chappell12/>\n\n===Second World War===\nIn September 1939 the [[Second World War]] commenced between the UK and its allies against Germany. In December 1941 the Japanese entered the war when it launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and launched a number of swift invasions of British and other countries territories. During the course of the war the Regiment raised a further three battalions, the 3rd in 1940, the 4th in 1941 and the 5th in 1942;<ref name=Chappell13/><ref>Cross & Gurung 2007, p. 31.</ref> the Regiment saw much service in the war but most notably in Malaya and Burma.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n[[Image:Imphalgurkhas.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of Gurkhas advancing alongside M3 Lee tanks towards foothills in the distance|Gurkhas advancing with tanks on the Imphal\u2013Kohima road, March\u2013July 1944]]\n[[File:A Gurkha soldier's tombstone at Kranji War Cemetery, Singapore.jpg|thumb|Gurkha graves in military cemetery, Singapore]]\n\nThe Regiment saw ferocious fighting during the [[Malayan Campaign|Japanese invasion of Malaya]]; the 2nd Battalion, part of the [[28th Indian Infantry Brigade|28th Brigade]], saw heavy fighting at [[Battle of Jitra|Jitra]] where it was forced to hastily retreat after taking part in the initial resistance on the [[Asun]] and being isolated and confronted by overwhelming Japanese forces which included tanks. The 2nd Battalion was in action a few weeks later at [[Battle of Kampar|Kampar]] where they successfully held off superior forces. Within a few days they were again in action but were out-numbered and sustained heavy casualties during the engagement at the [[Battle of Slim River|Slim River Bridge]] on 7 January.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Allies had withdrawn from Malaya, to [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], by January 1942. The Japanese subsequently launched an invasion of Singapore and bitter fighting ensued; Singapore, which had once been perceived as impregnable, fell on 15 February 1942 with 130,000 British, Australian and [[British Empire|Empire]] troops, including men of the 2nd Battalion,<ref>Cross & Gurung 2007, p. 37.</ref> taken [[Prisoner of war|prisoner]] by the Japanese.\n\nIn Burma, a similar situation occurred, the Allies\u2014having come under intense attacks from the Japanese who had begun their offensive in December\u2014had to commence a retreat to India from February 1942 which was completed in May.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 8.</ref> Later, the battalions of the Regiment saw heavy fighting again in 1944 in the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u20131943|Arakan campaign]] and during the Japanese offensive against north-east India where two important battles, [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] and [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]], took place from March to June 1944. [[Imphal]] was besieged by the Japanese until the Allies achieved a decisive victory at [[Kohima]] in June and the Japanese fled back into Burma. The Regiment subsequently took part in the successful Allied offensive into Burma and on 3 May 1945 the Burmese capital [[Rangoon]] was liberated by British forces.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 11.</ref> There were still Japanese forces present in Burma but the fight against the Japanese was now ostensibly a mopping up operation.<ref>Brayley 2002, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nThe war concluded with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945 on the deck of the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] in [[Tokyo Bay]]; the Allies had prevailed after nearly six years of fighting. In [[French Indochina]] that same day the [[Viet Minh]], led by [[Ho Chi Minh]], declared their independence from France as the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. Shortly afterwards the British began to send units of the [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Indian Infantry Division]], which the 1st and 3rd Battalions were part of, to occupy the south of the country while the [[Nationalist Chinese]] occupied the north; the deployment was completed by October.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The force was intended to disarm the Japanese forces and help in their repatriation back to Japan. The force, however, soon became embroiled in the fight against the Viet Minh and was soon helping in the restoration of French-control over the country. The British were, due to a lack of sufficient manpower, ironically forced to have the Japanese forces working alongside their own in Indochina in order to maintain peace and stability. The operations against the Viet Minh gradually became more intense and after substantial French reinforcements arrived the British and Indian forces departed by May 1946, and the [[First Indochina War]] would begin shortly afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFrom September 1945 the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]], which the 4th Battalion was part of, was deployed to [[Siam]] (now [[Thailand]])<ref name=Chappell13/> as part of an occupation force sent there to disarm the large Japanese forces present. The Battalion subsequently moved to Malaya in 1946 and then onto India.\n\nIn 1946, the 2nd Battalion, having been captured in Malaya in 1942, was reconstituted from personnel taken from the 3rd Battalion, which subsequently was demobilised along with the 4th and 5th Battalions.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\n===Post Independence===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn 1947 an agreement, known as the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]] between India, [[Nepal]] and the United Kingdom was negotiated in order to determine what would happen to the Gurkhas upon the formalisation of India's Independence.<ref>Cross & Gurung 2007, p. 169.</ref> As a result of this agreement it was decided that of the pre-war Gurkha regiments, four would be transferred to the [[British Army]], while six\u2014one of which was the 1st Gurkhas\u2014would become part of the newly independent [[Indian Army]].<ref name=Parker224>Parker 2005, p. 224.</ref>\n\nDespite India achieving its independence, the Regiment retained its full designation until 1950 when it became the '''1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''', also adopting the Indian spelling of [[Gurkha]], following India's transition to a republic.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\nOver time the wartime battalions that had been disbanded in 1946 were re-raised, so that by 1965 the Regiment consisted of five battalions once more.<ref name=Singh2007/><ref group=\"Note\">The 3rd Battalion was re-raised in 1959, the 4th in 1963 and the 5th in 1965.</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Captain [[Gurbachan Singh Salaria]] received the posthumous [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), India's highest military honour, for his actions in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] when the 3rd Battalion, of which he was part, was on [[United Nations]] service.<ref name=bharat/>\n\n====6th Battalion====\n\nOn 1 April 2015, a new battalion with about 700 soldiers was raised as 6th Battalion First Gorkha Rifles. This is the first Gorkha battalion to have come up in 50 years. The new battalion, the Sixth Battalion of the First Gorkha Rifles (6/1GR), christened \"Kanchi Paltan\", was raised at Sabathu in the Shivalik foothills near Shimla, that houses the 14 Gorkha Training Centre.<ref>http://www.indiangorkhas.in/2016/04/first-gorkha-regiment-gets-new-battalion-6by1GR.html</ref> It is the first Gorkha battalion comprising only locally domiciled Gurkhas.

(The Malaun Regiment)''', often referred to as the '''1st Gorkha Rifles''', or '''1 GR''' in abbreviation, is the seniormost [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha]] [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[Indian Army]]. It was originally formed as part of the [[East India Company]]'s [[Bengal Army]] in 1815, later adopting the title of the '''1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''', however, in 1947, following the [[partition of India]], it was transferred to the Indian Army and in 1950 when India became a Republic, it was redesignated as '''1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)'''. The regiment has a long history and has participated in many conflicts, including many of the colonial conflicts prior to Indian independence, as well as the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s. Since 1947 the regiment has also participated in a number of campaigns against Pakistan in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] as well as undertaking peacekeeping duties as part of the [[United Nations]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\n{{main|Gurkha War}}\n\nThe Gurkha War was fought between the Gorkha kings of Nepal and the [[British East India Company]] as a result of border tensions and ambitious expansionism especially into Kumaon, Garwhal and Kangra hills. Although the British East India Company's army defeated the Gorkha army led by General [[Amar Singh Thapa]], they were nevertheless impressed by the skill and courage the Gorkhas had shown during the siege of Malaun fort in [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]].<ref name=Singh2007>Singh 2007.</ref><ref name=Parker45>Parker 2005, p. 45.</ref> As a result, during the post war settlement a clause was inserted into the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] enabling the British to recruit Gorkhas.<ref name=Parker45/> On 24 April 1815 at Subathu, the East India Company formed a regiment with the survivors of Thapa's army calling it the First Nusseree Battalion.<ref group=\"Note\">The designation Nusseeree, or Nasiri, means friendly or loyal.</ref><ref>Parker 2005, p. 46.</ref> The formation of this unit marks the beginning of the history of the first Gorkha regiment.\n\n===Early campaigns===\n[[File:The Nusseree Battalion.JPG|thumb|The Nusseree Battalion later known as the ''1st Gurkha Rifles'' circa 1857]]\n\nThe Regiment soon saw its first battle when, in 1826, it took part in the [[Jat War]] where it helped in the conquest of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]],<ref name=army/><ref name=Chappell12>Chappell 1993, p. 12.</ref> gaining it as a [[battle honour]], the first battle honour awarded to the Gurkha units. In 1846 the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] began and the Regiment was heavily involved in the conflict. It was awarded two battle honours for its involvement in the war; at the [[Battle of Aliwal]] which saw the [[Sikh]] forces, who had invaded [[British India]].<ref name=Chappell12/><ref name=Nicholson08>Nicholson 1974, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe Regiment experienced numerous names changes during the 1800s; one name change in 1850 saw it gain a new numerical designation to become the '''66th Goorkha Regiment of [[Bengal Native Infantry]]'''<ref name=army/> after the original 66th had mutinied.<ref name=Chappell12/> The Regiment saw service during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] which began in 1857. The following year Lieutenant [[John Adam Tytler]] became the first Gurkha officer to be awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC), receiving it for his actions against rebels at [[Choorpoorah]].<ref>Parker 2005, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nIn 1861 the Regiment gained its present numerical designation when it became the '''1st Goorkha Regiment'''. In 1875, the Regiment, under the command of [[James Rawlins|Colonel James Sebastian Rawlins]], was sent abroad for the first time, when it took part in the effort to quell a rebellion in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] during the [[Perak War]]. During the conflict Captain [[George Nicolas Channer]] was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valiant actions against the Malayans.<ref name=Parker391>Parker 2005, p. 391.</ref> The Regiment took part in the [[Second Afghan War]] in 1878 where they were part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade and won the [[Theatre Honour]] \"Afghanistan 1878\u201380\".<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\nIn 1886 the Regiment became the '''1st Goorkha Light Infantry''' and a 2nd Battalion was raised in February.<ref name=Singh2007/> In 1891 the Regiment was designated a [[Rifle]] regiment when it became the '''1st Gurkha (Rifle) Regiment''' and in consequence of this the Regiment's [[Colour (flag)|Colours]] were laid up.<ref group=\"Note\">Rifle regiments by tradition did not possess Colours.</ref> The Regiment then took part in operations in [[Burma]] and the [[North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan|North-West Frontier]] campaigns in the 1890s; at [[Waziristan]] in 1894 and the [[Tirah Campaign|Tirah]] campaign in 1897.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn 1901 the Regiment's title was shortened when it became the '''1st Gurkha Rifles''' and in 1903 its title was changed once more, this time to the '''1st Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)'''.<ref name=Chappell12/> This title had been adopted to commemorate due to the significance of [[Malaun]] to the Regiment; it was where the British had decisively beaten the Gurkhas in 1815 during the [[The Gurkha War|Anglo\u2013Gurka War]] and subsequently recruited them into the Nusseree battalions. The Regiment was located near [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] when the [[1905 Kangra earthquake]] struck on 4 April, killing 20,000 people. The 1st Gurkhas themselves suffered over 60 fatalities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn 1906 its title was changed to the '''1st Prince of Wales's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''' in honour of George, Prince of Wales (later King [[George V]]) who also became Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment that year.<ref name=Chappell12/> In 1910 King George V ascended to the throne and in consequence the title of the regiment was changed to the '''1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''',<ref name=army/> thus maintaining the Regiment's links with King George.\n\n===First World War===\nIn August 1914 the [[First World War]] began. In December, the 1st Battalion was deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France as part of the [[Sirhind Indian Infantry Brigade]], attached to [[3rd (Lahore) Division]]. The 1st Battalion's first taste of trench warfare came when they were involved in the defence of [[Battle of Givenchy|Givenchy]] shortly after. After braving a winter in the trenches, on 10 March 1915 the 1st Battalion took part in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] which lasted until 13 March. In April the Battalion took part in the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], fighting in the subsidiary [[Battle of St. Julien]] which began on 24 April and concluded on 4 May. Later that month the Battalion took part in the [[Battle of Festubert]] and in September the [[Battle of Loos]] began, the last major engagement on the Western Front that the 1st Battalion took part in, before being withdrawn from the Western Front.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe Western Front was a completely different location to what the Regiment had been used to in the [[Indian subcontinent|sub-continent]] and they, as indeed did the other Indian Army troops, suffered badly during the winter months. As a result, in December 1915 it was decided that the infantry units of the [[Indian Corps]] would be withdrawn from France and sent to other theatres.<ref>Neillands 2004, p. 225.</ref> As a result, the 1st Battalion, along with the rest of the 3rd Division, was sent to [[Mesopotamia]] to take part in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign|campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] which had begun in 1914.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Sirhind Brigade was given a numerical designation, the 8th Brigade. In 1916 the 1st Gurkhas took part in a number of attempts, including the attack on [[Dujaila Redoubt]] in March, to relieve [[Siege of Kut|Kut-al-Amara]], which had been besieged by the Ottomans since 7 December 1915. Those attempts, however, failed and Kut remained under siege until it surrendered to the Ottomans on 29 April 1916.<ref>Gardner 2004, p. 324.</ref>\n\nFollowing this the Regiment took part in the Allied offensive against the Ottomans later that year; this included the effort to recapture Kut, begun in December, which was recaptured in February 1917 and the capital [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|Baghdad]] which was taken the following month. The 1st Battalion was later moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in early 1918. It was involved in the effective Allied offensive against the Ottomans in September, the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], and also saw action at the [[Battle of Sharon|Sharon]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nElsewhere, the 2nd Battalion saw service in the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] of India, gaining the Battle Honour \"North-West Frontier 1915\u201317\" in the process. In 1917 a 3rd Battalion was raised for home service in India.<ref name=Chappell12/>\n\nDuring the period that they had served on the Western Front in France the men of the 1st Gurkhas had found the conditions quite different from those that they were used to, however, they acquitted themselves commendably, performing with distinction in the many battles they took part in, proving the capability of the Gurkhas once more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The war formally ended on 11 November 1918 with the signing of the [[Armistice]]. The Regiment won 11 Battle Honours and 4 Theatre Honours during the war.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\n===Inter war years===\nIn 1919 the 1st and 2nd Battalions saw service during the brief [[Third Afghan War]] for which they gained the Theatre Honour \"Afghanistan 1919\".<ref name=Chappell13/> In 1921 the 3rd Battalion was disbanded.<ref name=Chappell12/> After this the Regiment participated in a number of campaigns on the North-West Frontier, serving mainly in Waziristan.<ref>Chappell 1993, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1937 the Regiment's name was altered slightly when it became the '''1st King George V's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)'''; the only change being the addition of a V.<ref name=Chappell12/>\n\n===Second World War===\nIn September 1939 the [[Second World War]] commenced between the UK and its allies against Germany. In December 1941 the Japanese entered the war when it launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and launched a number of swift invasions of British and other countries territories. During the course of the war the Regiment raised a further three battalions, the 3rd in 1940, the 4th in 1941 and the 5th in 1942;<ref name=Chappell13/><ref>Cross & Gurung 2007, p. 31.</ref> the Regiment saw much service in the war but most notably in Malaya and Burma.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n[[Image:Imphalgurkhas.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of Gurkhas advancing alongside M3 Lee tanks towards foothills in the distance|Gurkhas advancing with tanks on the Imphal\u2013Kohima road, March\u2013July 1944]]\n[[File:A Gurkha soldier's tombstone at Kranji War Cemetery, Singapore.jpg|thumb|Gurkha graves in military cemetery, Singapore]]\n\nThe Regiment saw ferocious fighting during the [[Malayan Campaign|Japanese invasion of Malaya]]; the 2nd Battalion, part of the [[28th Indian Infantry Brigade|28th Brigade]], saw heavy fighting at [[Battle of Jitra|Jitra]] where it was forced to hastily retreat after taking part in the initial resistance on the [[Asun]] and being isolated and confronted by overwhelming Japanese forces which included tanks. The 2nd Battalion was in action a few weeks later at [[Battle of Kampar|Kampar]] where they successfully held off superior forces. Within a few days they were again in action but were out-numbered and sustained heavy casualties during the engagement at the [[Battle of Slim River|Slim River Bridge]] on 7 January.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Allies had withdrawn from Malaya, to [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], by January 1942. The Japanese subsequently launched an invasion of Singapore and bitter fighting ensued; Singapore, which had once been perceived as impregnable, fell on 15 February 1942 with 130,000 British, Australian and [[British Empire|Empire]] troops, including men of the 2nd Battalion,<ref>Cross & Gurung 2007, p. 37.</ref> taken [[Prisoner of war|prisoner]] by the Japanese.\n\nIn Burma, a similar situation occurred, the Allies\u2014having come under intense attacks from the Japanese who had begun their offensive in December\u2014had to commence a retreat to India from February 1942 which was completed in May.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 8.</ref> Later, the battalions of the Regiment saw heavy fighting again in 1944 in the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u20131943|Arakan campaign]] and during the Japanese offensive against north-east India where two important battles, [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] and [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]], took place from March to June 1944. [[Imphal]] was besieged by the Japanese until the Allies achieved a decisive victory at [[Kohima]] in June and the Japanese fled back into Burma. The Regiment subsequently took part in the successful Allied offensive into Burma and on 3 May 1945 the Burmese capital [[Rangoon]] was liberated by British forces.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 11.</ref> There were still Japanese forces present in Burma but the fight against the Japanese was now ostensibly a mopping up operation.<ref>Brayley 2002, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nThe war concluded with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945 on the deck of the [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] in [[Tokyo Bay]]; the Allies had prevailed after nearly six years of fighting. In [[French Indochina]] that same day the [[Viet Minh]], led by [[Ho Chi Minh]], declared their independence from France as the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. Shortly afterwards the British began to send units of the [[20th Infantry Division (India)|20th Indian Infantry Division]], which the 1st and 3rd Battalions were part of, to occupy the south of the country while the [[Nationalist Chinese]] occupied the north; the deployment was completed by October.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The force was intended to disarm the Japanese forces and help in their repatriation back to Japan. The force, however, soon became embroiled in the fight against the Viet Minh and was soon helping in the restoration of French-control over the country. The British were, due to a lack of sufficient manpower, ironically forced to have the Japanese forces working alongside their own in Indochina in order to maintain peace and stability. The operations against the Viet Minh gradually became more intense and after substantial French reinforcements arrived the British and Indian forces departed by May 1946, and the [[First Indochina War]] would begin shortly afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFrom September 1945 the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]], which the 4th Battalion was part of, was deployed to [[Siam]] (now [[Thailand]])<ref name=Chappell13/> as part of an occupation force sent there to disarm the large Japanese forces present. The Battalion subsequently moved to Malaya in 1946 and then onto India.\n\nIn 1946, the 2nd Battalion, having been captured in Malaya in 1942, was reconstituted from personnel taken from the 3rd Battalion, which subsequently was demobilised along with the 4th and 5th Battalions.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\n===Post Independence===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn 1947 an agreement, known as the [[Britain-India-Nepal Tripartite Agreement|Tripartite Agreement]] between India, [[Nepal]] and the United Kingdom was negotiated in order to determine what would happen to the Gurkhas upon the formalisation of India's Independence.<ref>Cross & Gurung 2007, p. 169.</ref> As a result of this agreement it was decided that of the pre-war Gurkha regiments, four would be transferred to the [[British Army]], while six\u2014one of which was the 1st Gurkhas\u2014would become part of the newly independent [[Indian Army]].<ref name=Parker224>Parker 2005, p. 224.</ref>\n\nDespite India achieving its independence, the Regiment retained its full designation until 1950 when it became the '''1st Gorkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)''', also adopting the Indian spelling of [[Gurkha]], following India's transition to a republic.<ref name=Chappell13/>\n\nOver time the wartime battalions that had been disbanded in 1946 were re-raised, so that by 1965 the Regiment consisted of five battalions once more.<ref name=Singh2007/><ref group=\"Note\">The 3rd Battalion was re-raised in 1959, the 4th in 1963 and the 5th in 1965.</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Captain [[Gurbachan Singh Salaria]] received the posthumous [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), India's highest military honour, for his actions in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] when the 3rd Battalion, of which he was part, was on [[United Nations]] service.<ref name=bharat/>\n\n====6th Battalion====\n\nOn 1 April 2015, a new battalion with about 700 soldiers was raised as 6th Battalion First Gorkha Rifles. This is the first Gorkha battalion to have come up in 50 years.

'''Overseas War''' ({{Lang|pt|Guerra do Ultramar}}) or in the [[Portuguese Empire|former colonies]] as the '''War of Liberation''' ({{Lang|pt|Guerra de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o}}), was fought between [[Portuguese military history|Portugal's military]] and the emerging [[nationalist]] movements in [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal's African colonies]] between 1961 and 1975. The Portuguese authoritarian regime at the time, the {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}}, was overthrown by a military [[Carnation Revolution|coup in 1974]], and the change in government brought the conflict to an end. The war was a decisive [[ideology|ideological]] struggle in [[Lusophone]] Africa, surrounding nations, and mainland Portugal.\n\nThe prevalent Portuguese and international historical approach considers the Portuguese Colonial War as was perceived at the time: a single conflict fought in three separate theaters of operations: [[Angolan War of Independence|Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambican War of Independence|Mozambique]] (sometimes including the [[Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli|1954 Indian Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] and [[Annexation of Goa|1961 Indian Annexation of Goa]]) rather than a number of separate conflicts as the emergent African countries aided each other during the war.\n\nUnlike other European nations during the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese {{lang|pt|Estado Novo}} regime did not withdraw from its African colonies, or the overseas provinces ({{lang|pt|prov\u00edncias ultramarinas}}) as those territories had been officially called since 1951. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements became active: the \n[[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] in Angola, [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] in Portuguese Guinea, and the [[FRELIMO|Mozambique Liberation Front]] in Mozambique.

Hoping at first for [[gold]], they soon found that [[slave]]s were the most valuable commodity available in the region for export. The [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] was already well-established in the [[African slave trade]], for centuries linking it to the [[Arab slave trade]]. However, the Portuguese who had conquered the Islamic port of [[Ceuta]] in 1415 and several other towns in current day [[Morocco]] in a [[Crusade]] against Islamic neighbors, managed to successfully establish themselves in the area. But the Portuguese never established much more than a foothold in either place.\n\nIn Guinea, rival Europeans grabbed much of the trade (mainly slaves) while local African rulers confined the Portuguese to the coast. These rulers then sent enslaved Africans to the Portuguese ports, or to forts in Africa from where they were exported. Thousands of kilometers down the coast, in Angola, the Portuguese found it even harder to consolidate their early advantage against encroachments by Dutch, British and French rivals. Nevertheless, the fortified Portuguese towns of [[Luanda]] (established in 1587 with 400 Portuguese settlers) and [[Benguela]] (a fort from 1587, a town from 1617) remained almost continuously in Portuguese hands.\n\nAs in Guinea, the slave trade became the basis of the local economy in Angola. Excursions traveled ever farther inland to procure captives that were sold by African rulers; the primary source of these slaves were those captured as a result of losing a war or inter-ethnic skirmish with other African tribes. More than a million men, women and children were shipped from Angola across the Atlantic. In this region, unlike Guinea, the trade remained largely in Portuguese hands. Nearly all the slaves were destined for [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]].\n\nIn [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], reached in the 15th century by Portuguese sailors searching for a maritime [[spice trade]] route, the Portuguese settled along the coast and made their way into the hinterland as ''[[Wikt:sertanejos|sertanejos]]'' (backwoodsmen). These sertanejos lived alongside [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders and even obtained employment among [[Shona people|Shona]] kings as interpreters and political advisers. One such ''sertanejo'' managed to travel through almost all the Shona kingdoms, including the [[Mutapa Empire]]'s (Mwenemutapa) metropolitan district, between 1512 and 1516.<ref>Oliver, p. 207</ref>\n\nBy the 1530s, small bands of Portuguese traders and [[Prospecting|prospector]]s penetrated the interior regions seeking gold, where they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete]] on the [[Zambezi River]] and tried to establish a monopoly over the gold trade. The Portuguese finally entered into direct relations with the Mwenemutapa in the 1560s.<ref>Oliver, p. 203</ref> However, the Portuguese traders and explorers settled in the coastal strip with greater success, and established strongholds safe from their main rivals in East Africa \u2013 the [[Omani Arabs]], including those of [[Zanzibar]].\n\n===Scramble for Africa and the World Wars===\n[[File:Combat de marracuene.jpg|thumb|The Battle of [[Marracuene]] in 1895]]\n[[File:Combat de Coolela.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Coolela in 1895]]\nPortugal's colonial claim to the region was recognized by the other European powers during the 1880s, during the [[Scramble for Africa]], and the final boundaries of Portuguese Africa were agreed by negotiation in Europe in 1891. At the time Portugal was in effective control of little more than the coastal strip of both Angola and Mozambique, but important inroads into the interior had been made since the first half of the 19th century. In Angola, construction of a railway from [[Luanda]] to [[Malanje]], in the fertile highlands, was started in 1885.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bismarck, Europe, and Africa : the Berlin Africa Conference 1884-1885 and the onset of partition|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=F\u00f6rster, Stig., Mommsen, Wolfgang J., 1930-2004., Robinson, Ronald, 1920-1999., German Historical Institute in London.|year=1988|isbn=0-19-920500-0|location=Oxford|pages=220|oclc=16754126}}</ref>\n\nWork began in 1903 on a commercially significant line from Benguela all the way inland to the Katanga region, aiming to provide access to the sea for the richest mining district of the Belgian Congo.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/article/benguela-more-just-current|title=Benguela - More than just a current|last=Ball|first=Peter|date=17 November 2015|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> The line reached the Congo border in 1928.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1914, both Angola and Mozambique had Portuguese army garrisons of around 2,000 men, African troops led by European officers. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Portugal sent reinforcements to both colonies, because the fighting in the neighboring German African colonies was expected to spill over the borders into its territories.\n\nAfter Germany declared war on Portugal in March 1916 the Portuguese government sent more reinforcements to Mozambique (the South Africans had captured German South West Africa in 1915). These troops supported British, South African and Belgian military operations against German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]]. In December 1917, German colonial forces led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]] invaded Mozambique from German East Africa. Portuguese, British and Belgian forces spent all of 1918 chasing Lettow-Vorbeck and his men across Mozambique, German East Africa and [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Portugal sent a total of 40,000 reinforcements to Angola and Mozambique during World War I.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rita|first=Fernando|date=|title=The First World War in Mozambique (1914-1918)|url=http://www.portugalgrandeguerra.defesa.pt/Documents/THE%20FIRST%20WORLD%20WAR%20IN%20MOZAMBIQUE%20(1914-1918).pdf|journal=Portugal Grande Guerra|volume=|pages=11|via=}}</ref>\n\nBy this time the regime in Portugal had been through two major political upheavals: from monarchy to republic in 1910 and then to a military dictatorship after a coup in 1926. These changes resulted in a tightening of Portuguese control in Angola. In the early years of the expanded colony, there was near constant warfare between the Portuguese and the various African rulers of the region. A systematic campaign of conquest and pacification was undertaken by the Portuguese. One by one the local kingdoms were overwhelmed and abolished.\n\nBy the middle of the 1920s the whole of Angola was under control. Slavery had officially ended in Portuguese Africa, but the plantations were worked on a system of paid [[serf]]dom by African labour composed of the large majority of ethnic Africans who did not have resources to pay Portuguese taxes and were considered unemployed by the authorities. After [[World War II]] and the first decolonization events, this system gradually declined. However, paid forced labor, including labor contracts with forced relocation of people, continued in many regions of Portuguese Africa until it was finally abolished in 1961.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Sandra I.|date=2016-06-27|title=\"Now we don't have anything\": remembering Angola through the lens of American missionaries|url=http://journals.openedition.org/configuracoes/3286|journal=Configura\u00e7\u00f5es.

Portugal joined [[NATO]] as a founding member in 1949, and was integrated within the various fledgling military commands of NATO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_162352.htm|title=Portugal and NATO - 1949|last=NATO|website=NATO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nNATO's focus on preventing a conventional Soviet attack against Western Europe was to the detriment of military preparations against guerrilla uprisings in Portugal's overseas provinces that were considered essential for the survival of the nation. The integration of Portugal in NATO resulted in the formation of a military \u00e9lite that were critical in the planning and implementation of operations during the Overseas War.

Instead, after a coup led by pro-U.S. forces failed to depose him, Salazar consolidated power and immediately sent reinforcements to the overseas territories, setting the stage for continued conflict in Angola. Similar scenarios would play out in other overseas Portuguese territories.\n\n==Multiethnic societies, competing ideologies, and armed conflict in Portuguese Africa==\nBy the 1950s, the European [[mainland Portugal|mainland Portuguese territory]] was inhabited by a society that was poorer and had a much higher illiteracy rate than the average Western European societies or those of North America. It was ruled by an authoritarian and conservative right-leaning dictatorship, known as the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime. By this time, the Estado Novo regime ruled both the Portuguese mainland and several centuries-old overseas territories as theoretically co-equal departments. The possessions were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Macau]], [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]], [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]].\n\nIn reality, the relation of mainland Portuguese to their overseas possessions was that of colonial administrator to a subservient colony. Political, legislative, administrative, commercial and other institutional relations between the colonies and Portugal-based individuals and organizations were numerous, though migration to, from, and between Portugal and its overseas departments was limited in size, due principally to the long distance and low annual income of the average Portuguese as well that of the indigenous overseas populations.\n\nAn increasing number of African anti-colonial movements called for total independence of the overseas African territories from Portugal. Some, like the U.S.-backed UPA<ref>The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy Towards Angola Since 1945, George Wright, Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7453-1029-X|9780745310299}}</ref> wanted national [[self-determination]], while others wanted a new form of government based on Marxist principles. Portuguese leaders, including Salazar, attempted to stave off calls for independence by defending a policy of assimilation, multiracialism, and [[civilising mission]], or [[Lusotropicalism]], as a way of integrating Portuguese colonies, and their peoples, more closely with Portugal itself.<ref>[http://www.barnard.edu/history/sample%20thesis/Fine%20thesis.pdf Colorblind Colonialism?

As far back as 1919, a Portuguese delegate to the International Labour Conference in Geneva declared: \"The assimilation of the so-called inferior races, by cross-breeding, by means of the Christian religion, by the mixing of the most widely divergent elements; freedom of access to the highest offices of state, even in Europe \u2013 these are the principles which have always guided Portuguese colonisation in Asia, in Africa, in the Pacific, and previously in America.\"<ref>Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nAs late as the 1950s the policy of 'colorblind' access and mixing of races did not extend to all of Portugal's African territories, particularly Mozambique, where in tune with other minority white regimes of the day in southern Africa, the territory was segregated along racial lines. Strict qualification criteria ensured that less than one per cent of black Mozambicans became full Portuguese citizens.<ref>Rupiya, Martin, ''[http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/historical-context.php Historical context: war and peace in Mozambique]'', Conciliation Resources (1998), retrieved 29 May 2011</ref>\n\n=== Settlement subsidies ===\n\nNumerous subsidies were offered by the Estado Novo regime to those Portuguese who agreed to settle in Angola or Mozambique, including a special premium for each Portuguese man who agreed to marry an African woman.<ref>Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), p. 161</ref> Salazar himself was fond of restating the old Portuguese policy maxim that any indigenous resident of Portugal's African territories was in theory eligible to become a member of Portuguese government, even its President. In practice, this never took place, though trained black Africans living in Portugal's overseas African possessions were allowed to occupy positions in a variety of areas including the military, the civil service, the clergy, education, and private [[business]] - providing they had the requisite education and technical skills.\n\n[[File:Cabral 2.png|thumb|Cabo Verdean and Bissau-Guinean revolutionary [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]]]]\nWhile access to basic, secondary and technical education remained poor until the 1960s, a few Africans were able to attend schools locally or in some cases in Portugal itself. This resulted in the advancement of certain black Portuguese Africans who would become prominent individuals during the war and its aftermath, including [[Samora Machel]], [[M\u00e1rio Pinto de Andrade]], [[Marcelino dos Santos]], [[Eduardo Mondlane]], [[Agostinho Neto]], [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]], [[Jonas Savimbi]], [[Joaquim Chissano]], and [[Gra\u00e7a Machel]]. Two state-run universities were founded in Portuguese Africa in the 1962 by the Minister of the Overseas [[Adriano Moreira]] (the ''[[Universidade de Luanda]]'' in Angola and the ''[[Universidade de Louren\u00e7o Marques]]'' in Mozambique, awarding a range of degrees from engineering to medicine<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://web.archive.org/web/19991005163123/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Troy/4285/ensino52.html 52. UNIVERSIDADE DE LUANDA]</ref>); however, most of their students came from Portuguese families living in the two territories. Several personalities in Portuguese society, including one of the most idolized sports stars in Portuguese football history, a black football player from [[Portuguese East Africa]] named [[Eus\u00e9bio]], were other examples of efforts towards assimilation and multiracialism in the Post-World War II period.\n\nAccording to Mozambican historian [[Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges Coelho]],<ref>\"African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique</ref> the Portuguese colonial army was largely segregated along terms of race and ethnicity until 1960. There were originally three classes of soldier in Portuguese overseas service: commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato). These categories were renamed to 1st, 2nd and 3rd class in 1960 - which effectively corresponded to the same categories. Later, after official discrimination based on skin colour was outlawed, some Portuguese commanders such as General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]] began a process of ''Africanization'' of Portuguese forces fighting in Africa. In Portuguese Guinea, this included a large increase in African recruitment along with the establishment of all-black military formations such as the ''Black Militias'' (''Mil\u00edcias negras'') commanded by Major [[Carlos Fabi\u00e3o]] and the ''African Commando Battalion'' (''Batalh\u00e3o de Comandos Africanos'') commanded by General [[Almeida Bruno]].<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 p. 340\">Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000), {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}, p. 340</ref>\n\nWhile black African soldiers constituted a mere 18% of the total number of troops fighting in Portugal's African territories in 1961, this percentage would rise dramatically over the next thirteen years, with black soldiers constituting over 50% of all government forces fighting in Africa by April 1974. Coelho noted that perceptions of African soldiers varied a good deal among senior Portuguese commanders during the conflict in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. General [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]], perhaps the most successful counterinsurgency commander, sought good relations with local civilians and employed African units within the framework of an organized counter-insurgency plan.<ref name=\"Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50\">Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges, ''African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique'', Portuguese Studies Review 10 (1) (2002), pp. 129\u2013150</ref> General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], by contrast, appealed for a more political and psycho-social use of African soldiers.<ref name=\"Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50\"/> On the other hand, General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]], the most conservative of the three, appears to have doubted the reliability of African forces outside his strict control, while continuing to view African soldiers as inferior to Portuguese troops.<ref name=\"Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50\"/><ref>Ka\u00falza de Arriaga (General), Li\u00e7\u00f5es de estrat\u00e9gia de curso de altos comandos \u2013 1966/67 (Lessons Of Strategy in the Course of High Command \u2013 1966/67), Vol. 12 (1971): As late as 1971, Ka\u00falza argued that the Portuguese government should tailor the social and political status progress of black Africans in Angola and Mozambique to the growth of the white settler population, while concluding that \"blacks are not highly intelligent, on the contrary, of all peoples of the world they are the least intelligent.\"</ref>\n\nNative African troops, although widely deployed were initially employed in subordinate roles as enlisted troops or noncommissioned officers. As the war went on, an increasing number of native Angolans rose to positions of command, though of junior rank. In the late 1950s, after 500 years of colonial rule, not only had Portugal failed to produce any native black governor, headmaster, police inspector, or professor, it had also failed to produce a single commander of senior commissioned rank in the overseas Army. Here Portuguese colonial administrators fell victim to the legacy of their own discriminatory and limited policies in education, which largely barred indigenous black Africans from an equal and adequate education until well after the outbreak of the insurgency.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 100-102\">Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), pp. 100\u2013102</ref> With illiteracy rates approaching 99 per cent and almost no African enrollment in secondary schools,<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 100-102\"/> few African candidates could qualify for Portugal's officer candidate programs; most African officers obtained their commission as the result of individual competence and valour on the battlefield.\n\nDespite these handicaps, while the overwhelming majority of black or native African soldiers served in the enlisted ranks, an increasing percentage were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers by the 1970s, including such officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose to command from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the elite all-African ''Comandos Africanos'', where he eventually became one of the most-decorated soldiers in the Portuguese Army.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the Portuguese authorities had fully perceived racial discriminatory policies and lack of investment in education as wrong and contrary to their overseas ambitions in Portuguese Africa, and willingly accepted a true [[color blindness (race)|color blindness]] policy with more spending in education and training opportunities, which started to produce a larger number of black high ranked professionals, including military personnel.\n\nAfter the World War II, as [[communist]] and [[anti-colonial]] ideologies spread across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of independence using various interpretations of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary ideology. These new movements seized on anti-Portuguese and anti-colonial sentiment<ref>[http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 Independence redux in postsocialist Mozambique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624032003/http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 |date=2009-06-24 }}, Alice Dinerman</ref> to advocate the complete overthrow of existing governmental structures in Portuguese Africa. These Marxist movements alleged that Portuguese policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of the territories' ethnic Portuguese population at the expense of local tribal control, the development of native communities, and the majority of the indigenous population, who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure to comply with government policies largely imposed from Lisbon. Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans. Statistically, Portuguese Africa's white Portuguese population were indeed wealthier and more educated than the indigenous majority.\n\nAfter conflict erupted between the UPA and MPLA and Portuguese military forces, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]<ref name=\"Kennedy\"/> advised [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] (via the US consulate in Portugal) that Portugal should abandon Portugal's African colonies.

Under the Salazar regime, a military draft required all males to serve three years of obligatory military service; many of those called up to active military duty were deployed to combat zones in Portugal's African overseas provinces. The national service period was increased to four years in 1967, and virtually all conscripts faced a mandatory two-year tour of service in Africa.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 34\" /> The existence of the draft and likelihood of combat in African counterinsurgency operations would over time result in a sharp increase in emigration by Portuguese men seeking to avoid such service.

Some Portuguese soldiers decapitated rebels and impaled their heads on stakes, pursuing a policy of \"[[an eye for an eye]], a tooth for a tooth\". Much of the initial offensive operations against Angolan UPA and MPLA insurgents was undertaken by four companies of ''[[Special Operations Troops Centre#History|Ca\u00e7adores Especiais]]'' (''Special Hunter'') troops skilled in light infantry and antiguerrilla tactics, and who were already stationed in Angola at the outbreak of fighting.<ref>Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000), {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}, pp. 94\u201397</ref> Individual Portuguese counterinsurgency commanders such as [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Fernando Robles]] of the ''6\u00aa Companhia de Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' became well known throughout the country for their ruthlessness in hunting down insurgents.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} {{YouTube|CwrphTMWbuY|A \u00abGUERRA\u00bb 3\u00ba Epis\u00f3dio \u2013 \u00abViol\u00eancia do lado Portugu\u00eas\u00bb}}, A Guerra by [[Joaquim Furtado]]</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese Army steadily pushed the UPA back across the border into Congo-Kinshasa in a brutal counteroffensive that also displaced some 150,000 Bakongo refugees, taking control of Pedra Verde, the UPA's last base in northern Angola, on 20 September 1961.<ref name=\"George, Edward 2005 pp. 9-10\"/> Within the next few weeks Portuguese military forces pushed the MPLA out of Luanda northeast into the Dembos region, where the MPLA established the \"1st Military Region\". For the moment, the Angolan insurgency had been defeated, but new [[guerrilla]] attacks would later break out in other regions of Angola such as [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] province, the central plateaus, and eastern and southeastern Angola.\n\n[[File:F.N.L.A. in Za\u00efre.jpg|thumb|left|Training of FNLA soldiers in Zaire]]\nBy most accounts, Portugal's counterinsurgency campaign in Angola was the most successful of all its campaigns in the Colonial War.<ref name=\"the war was won\"/> Angola is a large territory, and the long distances from safe havens in neighboring countries supporting the rebel forces made it difficult for the latter to escape detection. The distance from the major Angolan urban centers to the neighboring [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]] were so large that the eastern part of Angola's territory was known by the Portuguese as ''Terras do Fim do Mundo'' (the lands of the far side of the world).\n\nAnother factor was internecine struggles between three competing revolutionary movements \u2013 FNLA, MPLA, and UNITA \u2013 and their guerrilla armies. For most of the conflict, the three rebel groups spent as much time fighting each other as they did fighting the Portuguese. For example, during the 1961 ''Ferreira Incident'', a UPA patrol captured 21 MPLA insurgents as prisoners, then summarily executed them on 9 October, sparking open confrontation between the two insurgent groups.\n\nStrategy also played a role, as a successful [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] campaign led by General [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] helped blunt the influence of the various revolutionary movements. Finally, as in Mozambique, Portuguese Angola was able to receive support of [[South Africa]]. South African military operations proved to be of significant assistance to Portuguese military forces in Angola, who sometimes referred to their South African counterparts as ''primos'' (cousins).\n\nSeveral unique counter-insurgency forces were developed and deployed in the campaign in Angola:\n\n* ''[[Parachute Troops School|Batalh\u00f5es de Ca\u00e7adores P\u00e1ra-quedistas]]'' (Paratrooper Hunter Battalions): employed throughout the conflicts in Africa, were the first forces to arrive in Angola when the war began.\n*''Comandos'' ([[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]]): born out of the war in Angola, they were created as an elite counter-[[guerrilla]] special forces, and later used in Guinea and Mozambique. \n* ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' ([[Special Operations Troops Centre#History|Special Hunters]]): were in Angola from the start of the conflict in 1961.\n* ''Fi\u00e9is'' (Faithfuls): a force composed by [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] exiles, black soldiers that opposed the rule of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in Congo-Kinshasa\n* ''Leais'' (Loyals): a force composed by exiles from [[Zambia]], black soldiers that were against [[Kenneth Kaunda]]\n* ''Grupos Especiais'' ([[Special Groups (Portugal)|Special Groups]]): units of volunteer black soldiers that had commando training; also used in Mozambique\n* ''Tropas Especiais'' (Special Troops): the name of Special Groups in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]]\n* ''[[Flechas]]'' (Arrows): a successful indigenous formation of scouts, controlled by the Portuguese secret police [[PIDE|PIDE/DGS]], and composed by [[Bushmen]] that specialized in tracking, reconnaissance and [[False flag#Pseudo-operations|pseudo-terrorist operations]]. Also employed in Mozambique, the ''Flechas'' inspired the formation of the Rhodesian [[Selous Scouts]].\n*''Grupo de Cavalaria N\u00ba1'' (1st Cavalry Group): a mounted cavalry unit, armed with the [[Heckler & Koch G3|7.62 mm Espingarda m/961]] rifle and the m/961 [[Walther P38]] pistol, tasked with reconnaissance and [[patrolling]]. The 1st was also known as the \"[[Angolan Dragoons]]\" (''Drag\u00f5es de Angola''). The Rhodesians would also later develop a similar concept of horse-mounted counter-insurgency forces, forming the [[Grey's Scouts]].\n* ''Batalh\u00e3o de Cavalaria 1927'' (1927 Cavalry Battalion): a [[tank]] unit equipped with the [[Stuart tank|M5A1 tank]]. The battalion was used for supporting infantry forces and as a [[rapid reaction force]]. Again the Rhodesians developed a similar unit, forming the [[Rhodesian Armoured Corps|Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment]].\n\n===Portuguese Guinea===\n{{Main|Guinea-Bissau War of Independence}}\n[[File:LocationGuineaBissau.svg|thumb|[[Guinea-Bissau]], formerly Portuguese Guinea, on a map of Africa]]\nIn [[Portuguese Guinea]] (also referred to as Guinea at that time), the [[Marxist]] [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) started fighting in January 1963. Its [[guerrilla]] fighters attacked the Portuguese headquarters in [[Tite (Guinea-Bissau)|Tite]], located to the south of [[Bissau]], the capital, near the Corubal river. Similar actions quickly spread across the entire colony, requiring a strong response from the Portuguese forces.\n\nThe war in Guinea has been termed \"Portugal's Vietnam\". The PAIGC was well-trained, well-led, and equipped and received substantial support from safe havens in neighboring countries like [[Senegal]] and the Republic of [[Guinea]] (Guinea-Conakry). The jungles of Guinea and the proximity of the PAIGC's allies near the border proved to be of significant advantage in providing tactical superiority during cross-border attacks and resupply missions for the guerrillas.\nThe conflict in Portuguese Guinea involving the PAIGC guerrillas and the [[Portuguese Army]] would prove the most intense and damaging of all conflicts in the Portuguese Colonial War, blocking Portuguese attempts to pacify the disputed territory via new economic and socioeconomic policies that had been applied with some success in [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]]. In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of Guinea; that year, the PAIGC carried out attacks in the north of the territory where at the time only the Front for the Liberation and Independence of Guinea (FLING), a minor insurgent group, was active. By this time, the PAIGC had begun to openly receive military support from [[Cuba]], [[China]] and the Soviet Union.\n\n[[File:Embarque.jpg|thumb|Portuguese troops board [[List of River-class frigates#Royal Navy (Group II)|NRP ''Nuno Trist\u00e3o'']] frigate in Portuguese Guinea, during amphibious Operation Trident (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Tridente''), 1964]]\nIn Guinea, the success of PAIGC guerrilla operations put Portuguese armed forces on the defensive, forcing them to limit their response to defending territories and cities already held. Unlike Portugal's other African territories, successful small-unit Portuguese counterinsurgency tactics were slow to evolve in Guinea. Defensive operations, where soldiers were dispersed in small numbers to guard critical buildings, farms, or infrastructure were particularly devastating to the regular Portuguese infantry, who became vulnerable to guerrilla attacks outside of populated areas by the forces of the PAIGC. They were also demoralized by the steady growth of PAIGC liberation sympathizers and recruits among the rural population. In a relatively short time, the PAIGC had succeeded in reducing Portuguese military and administrative control of the territory to a relatively small area of Guinea. The scale of this success can be seen in the fact that native Guineans in the 'liberated territories' ceased payment of debts to Portuguese landowners and the payment of taxes to the colonial administration.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144\">Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), pp. 140\u2013144</ref> The branch stores of the ''Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril'' (CUF), ''Mario Lima Whanon'', and ''Manuel Pinto Brand\u00e3o'' companies were seized and inventoried by the PAIGC in the areas they controlled, while the use of Portuguese currency in the areas under guerrilla control was banned.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144\"/> In order to maintain the economy in the liberated territories, the PAIGC established its own administrative and governmental bureaucracy at an early stage, which organized agricultural production, educated PAIGC farmworkers on how to protect crops from destruction from aerial attack by the Portuguese Air Force, and opened ''armazens do povo'' (people's stores) to supply urgently needed tools and supplies in exchange for agricultural produce.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144\"/>\n\nIn 1968, General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], the Portuguese general responsible for the Portuguese military operations in Guinea, was appointed as governor. General Sp\u00ednola began a series of civil and military reforms designed to weaken PAIGC control of the Guinea and rollback insurgent gains. This included a 'hearts and minds' propaganda campaign designed to win the trust of the indigenous population, an effort to eliminate some of the discriminatory practices against native Guineans, a massive construction campaign for public works including new schools, hospital, an improved telecommuncations and road network, and a large increase in recruitment of native Guineans into the Portuguese armed forces serving in Guinea as part of an ''Africanization'' strategy.\n\nUntil 1960, Portuguese military forces serving in Guinea were composed of units led by white officers, with commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato) serving in the enlisted ranks. General Sp\u00ednola's Africanization policy eliminated these discriminatory colour bars, and called for the integration of indigenous Guinea Africans into Portuguese military forces in Africa. Two special indigenous African counterinsurgency detachments were formed by the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]. The first of these was the African Commandos (''Comandos Africanos''), consisting of a battalion of [[Comandos|commando]]s composed entirely of black soldiers (including the officers). The second was the African Special Marines (''Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos''), [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marine]] units entirely composed of black soldiers. The African Special Marines supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea in an attempt to interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies. General Sp\u00ednola's Africanization policy also fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces, culminating the establishment of all-black military formations such as the Black Militias (''Mil\u00edcias negras'') commanded by Major [[Carlos Fabi\u00e3o]].<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 p. 340\" /> By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa, including such higher-ranking officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the ''Comandos Africanos''.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1960s, military tactical reforms instituted by Gen. Sp\u00ednola began to improve Portuguese counterinsurgency operations in Guinea. Naval amphibious operations were instituted to overcome some of the mobility problems inherent in the underdeveloped and marshy areas of the territory, using ''[[Portuguese Marine Corps|Destacamentos de Fuzileiros Especiais (DFE)]]'' (special marine assault detachments) as strike forces. The ''Fuzileiros Especiais'' were lightly equipped with folding-stock m/961 (G3) rifles, 37mm rocket launchers, and light machine guns such as the [[Heckler & Koch HK21]] to enhance their mobility in the difficult, swampy terrain.\n\n[[File:PAIGC posto de controlo.jpg|thumb|A PAIGC checkpoint in 1974]]\nPortugal commenced ''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Mar Verde'' or ''[[Operation Green Sea]]'' on 22 November 1970 in an attempt to overthrow [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]], the leader of the Guinea-Conakry and staunch PAIGC ally, to capture the leader of the PAIGC, [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]], and to cut off supply lines to PAIGC insurgents. The operation involved a daring raid on [[Conakry]], a PAIGC safe haven, in which 400 Portuguese ''Fuzileiros'' (amphibious assault troops) attacked the city. The attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] failed, though the Portuguese managed to destroy several PAIGC ships and free hundreds of Portuguese [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) at several large POW camps. One immediate result of ''Operation Green Sea'' was an escalation in the conflict, with countries such as [[Algeria]] and [[Nigeria]] now offering support to the PAIGC as well as the [[Soviet Union]], which sent warships to the region (known by NATO as the ''West Africa Patrol'') in a show of force calculated to deter future Portuguese amphibious attacks on the territory of the Guinea-Conakry. The [[United Nations]] passed several resolutions condemning cross-border attacks of the Portuguese military against the PAIGC guerrilla bases in both neighboring Guinea-Conakry and Senegal, like the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 290]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 294]] and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 295]].\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces increased their offensive posture, in the form of raids into PAIGC-controlled territory. At this time Portuguese forces also adopted unorthodox means of countering the insurgents, including attacks on the political structure of the nationalist movement. This strategy culminated in the assassination of Am\u00edlcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to increase its strength, and began to heavily press Portuguese defense forces. This became even more apparent after the PAIGC received heavy radar-guided [[anti-aircraft weapons|anti-aircraft cannon]] and other AA munitions provided by the Soviets, including [[SA-7]] shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, all of which seriously impeded Portuguese air operations.<ref name=\"Dos Santos 2009\"/><ref>Chilcote, Ronald H., ''The Struggle for Guinea-Bissau'', ''Africa Today'', July 197?), pp. 57\u201361</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Carnation Revolution]] military coup in [[Lisbon]] on 25 April 1974, the new revolutionary leaders of Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in [[Algiers]], Algeria in which Portugal agreed to remove all troops by the end of October and to officially recognize the [[Republic of Guinea-Bissau]] government controlled by the PAIGC, on 26 August 1974 and after a series of diplomatic meetings.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\">Lloyd-Jones, Stewart, and Costa Pinto, Ant\u00f3nio, ''The last empire: thirty years of Portuguese decolonization'', Portland, Oregon: Intellect Books, {{ISBN|1-84150-109-3}}, p. 22</ref> Demobilized by the departing Portuguese military authorities after the independence of Portuguese Guinea had been agreed, a total of 7,447 black Guinea-Bissauan African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC after the independence of the new African country.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\"/><ref>PAIGC, Jornal N\u00f4 Pintcha, 29 November 1980: In a statement in the party newspaper '' N\u00f4 Pintcha'' (''In the Vanguard''), a spokesman for the PAIGC revealed that many of the ex-Portuguese indigenous African soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of [[Cumer\u00e1]], [[Portogole]], and [[Mansab\u00e1]].</ref><ref name=\"Munslow, Barry 1981 pp. 109-113\">Munslow, Barry, ''The 1980 Coup in Guinea-Bissau'', Review of African Political Economy, No. 21 (May\u2013Sep., 1981), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\n===Mozambique===\n{{Main|Mozambican War of Independence}}\n[[File:LocationMozambique.svg|thumb|[[Mozambique]] within modern-day Africa.]]\n\nThe Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] was the last territory to start the war of liberation. Its nationalist movement was led by the [[Marxist-Leninist]] Liberation Front of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]), which carried out the first attack against Portuguese targets on September 25, 1964, in [[Chai, Mozambique|Chai]], [[Cabo Delgado Province]]. The fighting later spread to [[Niassa]], [[Tete]] in central Mozambique. A report from Battalion No. 558 of the Portuguese army makes references to violent actions, also in Cabo Delgado, on August 21, 1964.\n\nOn November 16 of the same year, the Portuguese troops suffered their first losses fighting in the north of the territory, in the region of [[Xilama]]. By this time, the size of the guerrilla movement had substantially increased; this, along with the low numbers of Portuguese troops and colonists, allowed a steady increase in FRELIMO's strength. It quickly started moving south in the direction of [[Meponda]] and [[Mandimba]], linking to Tete with the aid of [[Malawi]].\n\nUntil 1967 the FRELIMO showed less interest in Tete region, putting its efforts on the two northernmost districts of Mozambique where the use of [[landmines]] became very common. In the region of [[Niassa]], FRELIMO's intention was to create a free corridor to [[Zambezia Province]]. Until April 1970, the military activity of FRELIMO increased steadily, mainly due to the strategic work of [[Samora Machel]] in the region of [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]].\n\n[[Rhodesia]] was involved in the war in Mozambique, supporting the Portuguese troops in operations and conducting operations independently. By 1973, the territory was mostly under Portuguese control.<ref name=\"Portuguese Mozambique development\">[[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] (General), [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/desenvol.html O DESENVOLVIMENTO DE MO\u00c7AMBIQUE E A PROMO\u00c7\u00c3O DAS SUAS POPULA\u00c7\u00d5ES \u2013 SITUA\u00c7\u00c3O EM 1974]</ref> The Operation \"''N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio''\" ([[Gordian Knot Operation]]) - conducted in 1970 and commanded by Portuguese Brigadier General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] - a conventional-style operation to destroy the guerrilla bases in the north of Mozambique, was the major military operation of the Portuguese Colonial War.

The reason for Arriaga's abrupt fate was an alleged incident with indigenous civilian populations, and the Portuguese government's suspicion that Arriaga was planning a military coup against Marcelo's administration in order to avoid the rise of leftist influences in Portugal and the loss of the African overseas provinces.\n\nThe construction of the [[Cahora Bassa]] Dam tied up nearly 50 percent of the Portuguese troops in Mozambique, and brought the FRELIMO to the [[Tete Province]], closer to some cities and more populated areas in the south. The FRELIMO failed, however, to halt the construction of the dam. In 1974, the FRELIMO launched mortar attacks against Vila Pery (now [[Chimoio]]), an important city and the first (and only) heavy populated area to be hit by the FRELIMO.\n\nIn Mozambique special units were also used by the Portuguese Armed Forces:\n\n* ''Grupos Especiais'' (Special Groups): locally raised counter-insurgency troops similar to those used in Angola\n* ''Grupos Especiais P\u00e1ra-Quedistas'' (Paratrooper Special Groups): units of volunteer black soldiers that were given airborne training\n* ''Grupos Especiais de Pisteiros de Combate'' (Combat Tracking Special Groups): special units trained in tracking and locating guerrillas forces\n* ''[[Flechas]]'' (Arrows), a special forces unit of the Portuguese secret police, formation of indigenous scouts and trackers, similar to the one employed in Angola\n\n===Major counter-insurgency operations===\n*1970 Mozambique \u2013 [[Gordian Knot Operation]] (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio'')\n*1970 Guinea-Bissau \u2013 [[Operation Green Sea]] (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Mar Verde'')\n*1971 Angola \u2013 ''[[Frente Leste]]'' (Portuguese for \"Eastern Front\")\n\n===Role of the Organisation of African Unity===\nThe [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) was founded May 1963. Its basic principles were co-operation between African nations and solidarity between African peoples. Another important objective of the OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organization in its first years and soon OAU pressure led to the situation in the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the [[UN Security Council]].\n\nThe OAU established a committee based in [[Dar es Salaam]], with representatives from [[Ethiopia]], [[Algeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Egypt]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zaire]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Nigeria]], to support African liberation movements. The support provided by the committee included military training and weapon supplies.\n\nThe OAU also took action in order to promote the international acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE), composed by the FNLA. This support was transferred to the MPLA and to its leader, [[Agostinho Neto]] in 1967. In November 1972, both movements were recognized by the OAU in order to promote their merger. After 1964, the OAU recognized PAIGC as the legitimate representatives of Guinea-Bissau and [[Cape Verde]] and in 1965 recognised FRELIMO for Mozambique.\n\n==Armament and tactics==\n\n=== Portugal ===\nIn 1961 the Portuguese had 79,000 in arms \u2013 58,000 in the Army, 8,500 in the Navy and 12,500 in the Air force (Cann, 1997). These numbers grew quickly. By the end of the conflict in 1974, due to the [[Carnation Revolution]] (a military coup in Lisbon), the total in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] had risen to 217,000.\n\nPrior to their own Colonial War the Portuguese military had studied French and British efforts in Indo-China, Algeria and Malaya (Cann, 1997). Based on their analysis of operations in those theatres and considering their own situation in Africa, the Portuguese military took the unusual decision to restructure their entire armed forces, from top to bottom, for [[counterinsurgency]]. This transformation did, however, take seven years to complete and only took its final form in 1968. By 1974, the counterinsurgency efforts were successful in the Portuguese territories of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], but in [[Portuguese Guinea]] the local guerrillas were making progress. As the conflict escalated, the Portuguese authorities developed progressively tougher responses, these included the [[Gordian Knot Operation]] and the [[Operation Green Sea]].\n\nWhen conflict erupted in 1961, Portuguese forces were badly equipped to cope with the demands of a counter-insurgency conflict. It was standard procedure, up to that point, to send the oldest and most obsolete material to the colonies. Thus, initial military operations were conducted using World War II radios, the old m/937 7.92mm [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser]] rifle, the Portuguese m/948 9mm [[FBP submachine gun]], and the equally elderly German m/938 7.92mm ([[MG 13]]) Dreyse and Italian [[8\u00d759mm RB Breda|8\u00d759mm RB]] m/938 ([[Breda M37]]) machine guns.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 17\">Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961\u201374'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 17</ref> Much of Portugal's older small arms came from Germany in various deliveries made mostly before World War II, including the Austrian Steyr/Erma [[MP 34]] submachine gun (m/942). Later, Portugal purchased arms and military equipment from France, West Germany, South Africa, and to a lesser extent, from Belgium, [[Israel]] and the US.\n\n[[File:G3a3.gif|thumb|A Portuguese version of [[Heckler & Koch G3|Heckler & Koch G3A3]] was used as the standard infantry weapon for most of Portugal's forces.

Instead, most infantryman used their rifles to fire individual shots. While the heavy m/961 and its relatively lengthy barrel were well-suited to patrol operations in open savannah, it tended to put Portuguese infantry at a disadvantage when clearing the low-ceilinged interiors of native buildings or huts, or when moving through thick bush, where ambush by a concealed insurgent with an automatic weapon was always a possibility. In these situations the submachine gun, hand grenade or rifle-launched grenade often became a more useful weapon than the rifle. [[Instalaza rifle grenades|Spanish rifle grenades]] were sourced from [[Instalaza]], but in due course, the [[Dilagrama m/65]] was more commonly used, using a derivative of the [[M26 grenade]] made under licence by [[INDEP]], the M312.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://aquellasarmasdeguerra.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/algunas-armas-utilizadas-en-la-guerra-colonial-portuguesa-1961-1974/ | title=Algunas armas utilizadas en la guerra Colonial Portuguesa 1961\u20131974 | date=4 June 2012 | accessdate=4 May 2016 | language =Spanish |trans-title=Some weapons used in the Portuguese Colonial War 1961\u20131974}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[general purpose machine gun]] role, the German [[MG42]] in 8mm and later 7.62mm NATO caliber was used until 1968, when the 7.62mm [[Heckler & Koch HK21|m/968 Metralhadora Ligeira]] became available.\n[[File:AssaltonaMatadaSanga....jpg|thumb|A Portuguese Air Force [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] helicopter deploying paratroopers armed with 7.62mm [[ArmaLite]] [[AR-10]] rifles during an assault operation in Angola.]]\n\nTo destroy enemy emplacements, other weapons were employed, including the 37&nbsp;mm (1.46&nbsp;in), 60&nbsp;mm (2.5&nbsp;in), and 89&nbsp;mm (3.5 in.) ''Lan\u00e7a-granadas-foguete'' ([[Bazooka]]), along with several types of recoilless rifles.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 183-184\"/><ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 18\">Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961\u201374'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 18</ref> Because of the mobile nature of counterinsurgency operations, heavy support weapons were less frequently used. However, the m/951 12.7mm ([[12 mm caliber|.50 caliber]]) U.S. [[M2 Browning]] heavy machine gun was used in ground and vehicle mounts, as were 60mm, 81mm, and later, 120mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 18\"/> Artillery and mobile [[howitzer]]s were used in a few operations.\n\nMobile ground operations consisted of patrol sweeps by armored car and reconnaissance vehicles. Supply convoys used both armored and unarmored vehicles. Typically, armored vehicles would be placed at the front, center, and tail of a motorized convoy. Several [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s were used, including the [[Panhard AML]], [[Panhard EBR]], [[Fox Armoured Car|Fox]] and (in the 1970s) the [[Bravia Chaimite|Chaimite]].\n[[File:Js-municiamento f-84.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84 Thunderjet]] being loaded with ordnance in the 1960s, at Luanda Air Base.]]\n[[File:Fiat G91.jpg|thumb|The Portuguese Airforce employed [[Fiat G.91]] aircraft like this in the Portuguese Colonial War.]]\nUnlike the [[Vietnam War]], Portugal's limited national resources did not allow for widespread use of the [[helicopter]]. Only those troops involved in [[Coup de main|coups de main]] attacks (called ''golpe de m\u00e3o'' in Portuguese) \u2013 mainly [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and Paratroopers \u2013 would deploy by helicopter. Most deployments were either on foot or in vehicles ([[Berliet]] and [[Unimog]] trucks). The helicopters were reserved for support (in a [[gunship]] role) or [[Medical evacuation|medical evacuation (MEDEVAC)]]. The [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] was the most widely used helicopter, although the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Puma|Puma]] was also used with great success. Other aircraft were employed: for [[air support]] the [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texan]], the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] and the [[Fiat G.91]] were used, along with a quantity of [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invaders]] covertly acquired in 1965; for [[reconnaissance]] the [[Dornier Do 27]] was employed. In the transport role, the [[Portuguese Air Force]] originally used the [[Junkers Ju 52]], followed by the [[Nord Noratlas]], the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymaster]], and the [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] (all of these aircraft were also used for Paratroop drop operations). From 1965, [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] began to purchase the Fiat G.91 to deploy to its African overseas territories of [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] in the close-support role.<ref name=\"nicollip174\">Nicolli 2003, p. 174</ref> The first 40 G.91 were purchased second-hand from the [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]], aircraft that had been produced for Greece and which differed from the rest of the Luftwaffe G.91s enough to create maintenance problems. The aircraft replaced the Portuguese F-86 Sabre.\n\nThe [[Portuguese Navy]] (particularly the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marines]], known as ''Fuzileiros'') made extensive use of patrol boats, [[landing craft]], and [[Zodiac Group|Zodiac]] [[inflatable boat]]s. They were employed especially in Guinea, but also in the [[Congo River]] (and other smaller rivers) in Angola and in the [[Zambezi]] (and other rivers) in Mozambique. Equipped with standard or collapsible-stock m/961 rifles, grenades, and other gear, they used small boats or patrol craft to infiltrate guerrilla positions. In an effort to intercept infiltrators, the ''Fuzileiros'' even manned small patrol craft on [[Lake Malawi]]. The Navy also used Portuguese civilian [[Cruise ship|cruisers]] as troop transports, and drafted [[Portuguese Merchant Navy]] personnel to man ships carrying troops and material and into the Marines.\n\nThere were also many [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War]] such as the [[Flechas]] and others, as mentioned above.\n\nNative black warriors were employed in Africa by the Portuguese colonial rulers since the 16th century. Portugal had employed regular native troops (''companhias indigenas'') in its colonial army since the early 19th century. After 1961, with the beginning of the colonial wars in its overseas territories, Portugal began to incorporate black Portuguese Africans into integrated units as part of the war effort in Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Mozambique, based on concepts of multi-racialism and preservation of the empire. African participation on the Portuguese side of the conflict varied from marginal roles as laborers and informers to participation in highly trained operational combat units like the [[Flechas]]. As the war progressed, use of African counterinsurgency troops increased; on the eve of the [[Carnation Revolution|military coup of 25 April 1974]], black ethnic Africans accounted for more than 50 percent of Portuguese forces fighting the war.\n\nFrom 1961 to the end of the Colonial War, the [[paratrooper]] [[nurse]]s nicknamed ''[[Maria (given name)|Marias]]'', were women who served the Portuguese armed forces being deployed in Portuguese Africa's dangerous guerrilla-infiltrated combat zones to perform [[rescue]] operations.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} {{YouTube|GBnrbRLOMlo|Enfermeiras P\u00e1ra-Quesdistas}}, [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://greenberet.no.sapo.pt/enfermeira.htm enfermeiras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031061716/http://greenberet.no.sapo.pt/enfermeira.htm |date=2010-10-31 }}, [[Green beret]], [[sapo.pt]]</ref>\n\nThroughout the war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. The later included [[International sanctions|UN-sponsored sanctions]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]]-led defamation, and myriad boycotts and protests performed by both foreign and domestic political organizations, like the clandestine [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP). Near the end of the conflict, a report by the controversial priest [[Adrian Hastings]], alleging atrocities and war crimes of the Portuguese military, was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister [[Marcelo Caetano]] was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the [[Anglo-Portuguese alliance]] in 1973. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings's claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the \"carnation revolution\" coup in Lisbon which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974, ending the Portuguese African counter-insurgency campaigns and triggering the rapid collapse of the [[Portuguese Empire]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] (June 26, 2001)</ref>\n\n===Guerrilla movements===\n[[File:AK 47.JPG|thumb|[[AK-47]] automatic rifles were widely used by the African guerrilla movements.]]\n[[File:SKS Flickr.jpg|thumb|[[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifles]] were also used by guerrillas.]]\nThe armament of the nationalist groups came mainly from the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Eastern Europe. However, they also used small arms of U.S. manufacture (such as the .45 [[Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompson submachine gun]]), along with British, French, and German weapons came from neighboring countries sympathetic to the rebellion. Later in the war, most guerrillas would use roughly the same infantry rifles of Soviet origin: the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] bolt-action rifle, the [[SKS]] carbine, and most importantly the [[AK-47]] series of [[7.62\u00d739mm]] automatic rifle, or Kalashnikov. Rebel forces also made extensive use of machine guns for ambush and positional defense.\n\nRapid-fire arms in use with the insurgents included the [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] [[Degtyaryov machine gun|DP-28]], the 7.62\u00d739mm [[RPD machine gun]] (the most widely used of all), the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser|8\u00d757mm Mauser]] [[MG 34]] general-purpose machine gun, together with the [[12.7\u00d7108mm]] [[DShK]] and the 7.62\u00d754mm [[SG-43 Goryunov]] heavy machine guns, [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev|7.62\u00d725mm]] [[PPSh-41]] and [[PPS submachine gun|PPS-43]], [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm]] [[Sa vz. 23]], [[Sterling submachine gun|Sterling]], [[MP 40]], [[MAT-49]] [[submachine gun]] operation. Support weapons included mortars, [[recoilless rifle]]s, and in particular, Soviet-made rocket launchers, the [[RPG-2]] and [[RPG-7]]. [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft (AA) weapons]] were also employed, especially by the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] and the [[FRELIMO]]. The [[14.5\u00d7114mm]] [[ZPU]] AA cannon was the most widely used, but by far the most effective was the [[Strela 2]] missile, first introduced to guerrilla forces in Guinea in 1973 and in Mozambique the following year by Soviet technicians.\n\nThe guerrillas' AK-47 rifles and such variants were highly thought of by many Portuguese soldiers, as they were more mobile than the m/961 (G3), while permitting the user to deliver a heavy volume of automatic fire at the closer ranges typically encountered in bush warfare.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267\">Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}, pp. 266\u2013267</ref> The AK-47's ammunition load was also lighter.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267\"/> The average Angolan or Mozambican rebel could easily transport 150 7.62\u00d739mm cartridges (five 30-round magazines) on his person during bush operations, compared to 100 7.62\u00d751mm rounds (five 20-round magazines) typically carried by a Portuguese infantryman on patrol.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267\"/> Though a common misconception holds that Portuguese soldiers used captured AK-47 type weapons, this was only true of a few elite units for special missions. Like U.S. forces in Vietnam, ammunition resupply difficulties and the obvious danger of being mistaken for a guerrilla when firing an enemy weapon generally precluded their use.\n\n[[Land mine|Mines]] and other [[booby trap]]s were one of the principal weapons used by the insurgents against Portuguese mechanized forces to great effect, who typically patrolled the mostly unpaved roads of their territories using motor vehicles and armored scout cars.<ref>Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 23: It is estimated that mines planted by insurgents caused about 70 per cent of all Portuguese casualties.</ref> To counter the mine threat, Portuguese engineers commenced the herculean task of tarring the rural road network.<ref>Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961\u201374'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 23</ref> Mine detection was accomplished not only by electronic mine detectors, but also by employing trained soldiers (''picadors'') walking abreast with long probes to detect nonmetallic road mines.\n\nGuerrillas in all the various revolutionary movements used a variety of mines, often combining [[Anti-tank mine|anti-tank]] with [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] mines to ambush Portuguese formations with devastating results. A common tactic was to plant large anti-vehicle mines in a roadway bordered by obvious cover, such as an irrigation ditch, then seed the ditch with anti-personnel mines. Detonation of the vehicle mine would cause Portuguese troops to deploy and seek cover in the ditch, where the anti-personnel mines would cause further casualties.\n\nIf the insurgents planned to confront the Portuguese openly, one or two heavy machine guns would be sited to sweep the ditch and other likely areas of cover. Other mines used included the [[PMN mine|PMN (Black Widow)]], [[TM-46 mine|TM-46]], and [[POMZ]]. Even amphibious mines were used such as the [[PDM series of amphibious mines|PDM]], along with numerous home-made antipersonnel wood box mines and other nonmetallic explosive devices. The impact of mining operations, in addition to causing casualties, undermined the mobility of Portuguese forces, while diverting troops and equipment from security and offensive operations to convoy protection and mine clearance missions.\n\nIn general, the PAIGC in Guinea was the best armed, trained and led of all the guerrilla movements. By 1970, it even had candidates training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] jets and to operate Soviet-supplied amphibious assault crafts and [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]].\n\n==Opposition in Portugal==\nThe government presented as a general consensus that the colonies were a part of the national unity, closer to overseas provinces than to true colonies. The [[Communism|communists]] were the first party to oppose the official view, since they saw the Portuguese presence in the colonies as an act against the colonies' right to [[self determination]]. During its 5th Congress, in 1957, the illegal [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (''Partido Comunista Portugu\u00eas'' \u2013 PCP) was the first political organization to demand the immediate and total independence of the colonies.\n\nHowever, being the only truly organized opposition movement, the PCP had to play two roles. One role was that of a communist party with an anti-colonialist position; the other role was to be a cohesive force drawing together a broad spectrum of opposing parties. Therefore, it had to accede to views that didn't reflect its true anticolonial position.\n\nSeveral opposition figures outside the PCP also had anticolonial opinions, such as the candidates to the fraudulent presidential elections, like [[Norton de Matos]] (in 1949), [[Quint\u00e3o Meireles]] (in 1951) and [[Humberto Delgado]] (in 1958). The communist candidates had, obviously, the same positions. Among them were [[Rui Lu\u00eds Gomes]] and [[Arlindo Vicente]], the first would not be allowed to participate in the election and the second would support Delgado in 1958.\n\nAfter the electoral fraud of 1958, Humberto Delgado formed the [[Independent National Movement]] (''Movimento Nacional Independente'' \u2013 MNI) that, in October 1960, agreed that there was a need to prepare the people in the colonies, before giving them the right of self-determination. Despite this, no detailed policies for achieving this goal were set out.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn 1961, the n\u00ba8 of the ''Military Tribune'' had as its title \"''Let's end the war of Angola''\". The authors were linked to the [[Patriotic Action Councils]] (''Juntas de Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Patri\u00f3tica'' \u2013 JAP), supporters of Humberto Delgado, and responsible for the attack on the [[barracks of Beja]]. The [[Portuguese National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Portuguesa de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional'' \u2013 FPLN), founded in December 1962, attacked the conciliatory positions. The official feeling of the Portuguese state, despite all this, was the same: Portugal had inalienable and legitimate rights over the colonies and this was what was transmitted through the media and through the state propaganda.\n\nIn April 1964, the Directory of Democratic-Social Action (''Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Democrato-Social'' \u2013 ADS) presented a political solution rather than a military one. In agreement with this initiative in 1966, [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] suggested there should be a referendum on the overseas policy Portugal should follow, and that the referendum should be preceded by a national discussion to take place in the six months prior to the referendum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe end of Salazar's rule in 1968, due to illness, did not prompt any change in the political panorama.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The radicalization of the opposition movements started with the younger people who also felt victimized by the continuation of the war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n=== Radicalization (early 1970s) ===\n\nThe universities played a key role in the spread of this position. Several magazines and newspapers were created, such as ''Cadernos Circunst\u00e2ncia'', ''Cadernos Necess\u00e1rios'', ''Tempo e Modo'', and ''Pol\u00e9mica'' that supported this view. The students that participated in this underground opposition faced serious consequences if caught by the PIDE \u2013 from immediate arrest to automatic conscription into a combat branch (infantry, marines, etc.) situated in the \"hot\" warzone (Guinea, Tete Province in Mozambique or eastern Angola). It was in this environment that the {{ill|Armed Revolutionary Action|pt|A\u00e7\u00e3o Revolucion\u00e1ria Armada}} (''Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Revolucion\u00e1ria Armada'' \u2013 ARA), the armed branch of the Portuguese Communist Party created in the late 1960s, and the {{ill|Revolutionary Brigades|pt|Brigadas Revolucion\u00e1rias}} (''Brigadas Revolucion\u00e1rias'' \u2013 BR), a left-wing organization, became an important{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} force of resistance against the war, carrying out multiple acts of sabotage and bombing against military targets.\n\nThe ARA began its military actions in October 1970, keeping them up until August 1972. The major actions were the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the [[NATO]] headquarters at [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in October of the same year. The BR, on its side, began armed actions on 7 November 1971, with the sabotage of the NATO base at [[Pinhal de Armeiro]], the last action being carried out 9 April 1974, against the [[Niassa]] ship which was preparing to leave Lisboa with troops to be deployed in [[Portuguese Guinea]]. The BR acted even in the colonies, placing a bomb in the Military Command of Bissau on 22 February 1974.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the Portuguese Colonial War raged on, consuming fully 40 percent of Portugal's annual budget.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 34\"/> The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal \u2013 thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.\n\nThe war in the Portuguese overseas territories of Africa was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people got weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. In addition, younger Portuguese military academy graduates resented a program introduced by [[Marcello Caetano]] whereby militia officers who completed a brief training program and had served in the overseas territories' defensive campaigns, could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates.\n\nCaetano's government had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened government budget.

General Sp\u00ednola was invited to assume the office of President, but resigned a few months later after it became clear that his desire to set up a system of federalized home rule for the African territories was not shared by the rest of the MFA, who wanted an immediate end to the war (achievable only by granting independence to the provinces of Portuguese Africa).<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 35\"/> The 25 April coup led to a series of temporary governments, marked by a [[Nationalization#Portugal|nationalization]] of many important areas of the economy.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Monument in Coimbra to the heroes of the Portuguese Colonial War.jpg|thumb|upright|Portuguese soldier with black [[Afro-Portuguese]] child, a monument to the Portuguese Overseas Territories' Heroes (''Her\u00f3is do Ultramar''), in [[Coimbra]], Portugal.]]\nAfter the coup on April 25, 1974, while the power struggle for control of Portugal's government was occurring in Lisbon, many Portuguese Army units serving in Africa simply ceased field operations, in some cases ignoring orders to continue fighting and withdrawing into barracks, in others negotiating local ceasefire agreements with insurgents.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 35\"/>\n\nOn 26 August 1974, after a series of diplomatic meetings, Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in Algiers, Algeria in which Portugal agreed to remove all troops by the end of October and to recognize the Republic of Guinea-Bissau government controlled by the PAIGC.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, after a period of eight months under which Mozambique had been administered by a provisional government, representatives of the Portuguese government and FRELIMO signed an agreement to grant independence to Mozambique, with the president of FRELIMO to assume the presidency of the newly independent nation.

The departure of the Portuguese from Angola and Mozambique increased the isolation of [[Rhodesia]], where [[white minority rule]] ended in 1980 when the territory gained international recognition as the Republic of [[Zimbabwe]] with [[Robert Mugabe]] as the head of government. The former Portuguese territories in Africa became sovereign states with [[Agostinho Neto]] (followed in 1979 by [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]]) in Angola, [[Samora Machel]] (followed in 1986 by [[Joaquim Chissano]]) in Mozambique and [[Lu\u00eds Cabral]] (followed in 1980 by [[Nino Vieira]]) in Guinea-Bissau, as [[heads of state]].\n\nIn contrast to some other European colonial possessions, many of the Portuguese living in Portuguese Africa had strong ties to their adopted land, as their ancestors had lived in Africa for generations.<ref>[[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]], [http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright06/Wright06.html White Faces In A Black Crowd: Will They Stay?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715093101/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF001975/Wright/Wright06/Wright06.html |date=2009-07-15 }}, ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' (May 27, 1975)</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt}} Carlos Fontes, [https://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page6portugal.html Emigra\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516050553/http://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page6portugal.html |date=2012-05-16 }}, Mem\u00f3rias da Emigra\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa</ref> For these individuals, the prospect of Portugal's imminent departure from its African territories was nearly impossible to comprehend. Nevertheless, most accepted the inevitable, and while an abortive right-wing settler revolt broke out in Mozambique, it quickly died out as Portuguese coup leaders made it clear that the decision to grant independence was irrevocable.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 35\"/>\n\nFear of reprisals and impending changes in political and economic status by the Marxist governments of the new African states resulted in the peaceful exodus of over one million Portuguese citizens of European, African and mixed ethnicity from the newly independent African territories to Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, and other countries.\n\n=== New governments of Angola and Mozambique ===\n\nThe new governments of Angola and Mozambique, faced a severe set of challenges as devastating civil wars broke out in both countries. Lasting several decades, these ongoing conflicts would eventually claim over two million lives and an even greater number of refugees, while destroying much of the infrastructure in both nations.<ref name=\"Norrie MacQueen\"/><ref>Government of Ireland, ''[http://www.irishaid.gov.ie/mozambique.asp Irish Aid \u2013 Mozambique: About Mozambique]'', Department of Foreign Affairs, retrieved 30 May 2011</ref><ref>Government of Ireland, ''[http://www.irishaid.gov.ie/angola.asp Irish Aid \u2013 Angola: Overview]'', Department of Foreign Affairs, retrieved 30 May 2011</ref> Resentments over economic difficulties caused by failed government policies, the general disenfranchisement of political opponents, and widespread corruption at the highest levels of government eroded the initial optimism present at independence. These problems were exacerbated by a tendency to consolidate power by directing public anger against ethnic Portuguese, mixed-race Africans,<ref name=\"post-independence goal\"/> and those who had supported the former colonial regime.\n\nMany of the local black soldiers that served in the [[Portuguese Army]] and who had fought against the insurgents were demobilized by Portuguese authorities and left behind in Africa. The most infamous reprisal occurred in Guinea-Bissau. Demobilized by the Portuguese authorities and abandoned to their fate, a total of 7,447 black African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC after Portuguese forces ceased hostilities.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\"/> In a statement in the party newspaper '' N\u00f4 Pintcha'' (''In the Vanguard''), a spokesman for the PAIGC revealed that many of the ex-Portuguese indigenous African soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of [[Cumer\u00e1]], [[Portogole]], and [[Mansab\u00e1]].<ref name=\"Munslow, Barry 1981 pp. 109-113\"/><ref>PAIGC, Jornal N\u00f4 Pintcha, 29 November 1980</ref>\n\nBecause the political regimes involved in wars or counterinsurgency tend to minimize unfavorable news stories about their military actions, many Portuguese remained unaware of the atrocities committed by the colonial regimes and the army. In 2007, a [[Radiotelevisao Portuguesa]] (RTP) documentary by [[Joaquim Furtado]], made public both these government-supported atrocities and the organized massacres and terror campaign policies of some pro-independence guerrilla movements or their supporters; it was watched by over a million people, a tenth of the population at the time.<ref>[http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/portugals-hidden-atrocities Concord Monitor, November 10 2007: \"Portugal's hidden atrocities; Documentary brings long-hidden brutality into public view\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523175246/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/portugals-hidden-atrocities |date=2012-05-23 }}</ref>\n\nWith the fall of the Estado Novo regime, most Portuguese citizens, tired of the long war and their isolation from the world community under the Caetano regime, supported the decision to recognize the independence of Portuguese Africa immediately, while accepting the inevitable loss of their former overseas territories. However, controversies over the MFA coup of 25 April 1974 and the decisions made by coup leaders remain to this day.\n\n==Economic consequences of the war==\n{{See also|Economic history of Portugal}}\n[[File:nt-DE das FA e Estado.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Evolution of the expenditure of the Portuguese state with the military during the war.]]\n\nIn Portugal, government budgets increased significantly during the war years. The country's expenditure on the armed forces ballooned since the beginning of the war in 1961. The expenses were divided into ordinary and extraordinary ones; the latter were the main factor in the huge increase in the military budget. The succession of [[Marcelo Caetano]], after Salazar's incapacitation, resulted in steady increases in military spending on the African wars through 1972.<ref>Dunne, Paul, and Nikolaidou, Eftychia Nikolaidou, ''Military Spending and Economic Growth in Greece, Portugal, and Spain'', Discussion Papers 0510, Department of Economics, University of the West of England (2005)</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 1972, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] was enacted through the Decree Law ''Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 448/ /72'' and the Ministry of Defense ordinance ''Portaria 696/72'', in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&seccao=Convidados&page=1 A verdade sobre o Fundo do Ultramar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511164133/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&seccao=Convidados&page=1 |date=2013-05-11 }}, [[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]] (November 29, 2012)</ref> While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government decided to create sustainability policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. In addition, new Decree Laws (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'') were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating militia and military academy officers in the Army branches as equals.<ref name=\"infopedia_a\">{{in lang|pt}} Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MFA).

Other indicators like GDP as percentage of Western Europe would indicate that Portugal was rapidly catching up to its European neighbors. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy influenced by a new generation of technocrats, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the EC-12 average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/64.htm Economic Growth and Change], [[U.S. Library of Congress]], countrystudies.us</ref>\n\nIn 1973, on the eve of the revolution, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56 percent of the EC-12 average. In 1975, the year of maximum revolutionary turmoil, Portugal's per capita GDP declined to 52 percent of the EC-12 average. Convergence of real GDP growth toward the EC average occurred as a result of Portugal's economic resurgence since 1985. In 1991 Portugal's GDP per capita climbed to 55 percent of the EC average, exceeding by a fraction the level attained just during the worst revolutionary period.<ref name=\"countrystudies\" />\n\nFor many decades to come after independence, the economies of the three former Portuguese African territories involved in the war continued to remain problematic due to continuing internecine political conflicts and power struggles as well as inadequate agricultural production caused by disruptive government policies resulting in high birth mortality rates, widespread malnutrition, and disease. By the 21st century, the [[Human Development Index]] of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, were among the lowest in the World, while [[Transparency International|corruption]] and [[Gini Index|social inequality]] soared.\n\nAfter 1974, the deterioration in [[central planning]] effectiveness, [[economic development]] and growth, security, education and health system efficiency, was rampant. None of the newly independent ex-Portuguese African states made any significant economic progress in the following decades, and political progress in terms of democratic processes and protection of individual human rights was either minimal or nonexistent. With few exceptions, the new regimes ranked at the bottom of human development and [[GDP per capita]] world tables. By 2002, however, the end of the [[Angolan Civil War]], combined with exploitation of the country's highly valuable natural resources, resulted in that country becoming economically successful for the first time in decades.\n\n==Films about the war==\n* ''Os Demonios de Alcacer-Quibir'' (Portugal 1975, director: Jose Fonseca da Costa).\n* ''[[Life Is Beautiful (1979 film)|La Vita \u00e8 Bella]]'' (Portugal/Italy/USSR 1979), director: [[Grigory Chukhray|Grigory Naumovich Chukhray]]).\n* ''Sorte que tal Morte'' (Portugal 1981, director: Joao Matos Silva).\n* ''Acto dos Feitos da Guine'' (Portugal 1980, director: [[Fernando Matos Silva]]).\n* ''Gestos & Fragmentos - Ensaio sobre os Militares e o Poder'' (Portugal 1982, director: Alberto Seixas Santos).\n* ''Um Adeus Portugu\u00eas'' (Portugal 1985, director: [[Joao Botelho]]).\n* ''Era Uma Vez Um Alferes'' (Portugal 1987, director: [[Luis Filipe Rocha]]).\n* ''Matar Saudades'' (Portugal 1987, director: [[Fernando Lopes Vasconcelos]])\n* ''A Idade Maior'' (Portugal 1990, director: [[Teresa Villaverde Cabral]]).\n* ''[[\"Non\", ou A V\u00e3 Gl\u00f3ria de Mandar]]'' (Portugal/France/Spain 1990, director: [[Manoel de Oliveira]]).\n* ''Ao Sul'' (Portugal 1993, director: Fernando Matos Silva).\n* ''[[Capit\u00e3es de Abril]]'' (''Captains of April'', Portugal 2000, director: [[Maria de Medeiros]]).\n* ''Assalto ao Santa Maria'' (''Assault on the Santa Maria'', Portugal 2009, director: [[Francisco Manso]]).\n\n== Documentaries ==\n* A Guerra - Colonial - do Ultramar - da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, 1st Season (Portugal 2007, director: [[Joaquim Furtado]], [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]])\n* A Guerra - Colonial - do Ultramar - da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, 2nd Season (Portugal 2009, director: Joaquim Furtado, RTP)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angolan War of Independence]]\n* [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]]\n* [[Mozambican War of Independence]]\n* [[Operation Gordian Knot]]\n* [[Carnation Revolution]]\n* [[Portuguese invasion of Guinea (1970)]]\n* [[Operation Vijay (1961)]] ([[Portuguese India]])\n* [[Lusophobia]]\n\n'''Portuguese military:'''\n* [[Portuguese Army Commandos]]\n* [[Special Operations Troops Centre]]\n* [[Parachute Troops School]]\n* [[Portuguese Marine Corps]]\n* [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War]]\n* [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]\n\n'''Contemporaneous wars:'''\n* [[Rhodesian Bush War]]\n* [[South African Border War]]\n\n'''Post-independence wars:'''\n* [[Angolan Civil War]]\n* [[Mozambican Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000) {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}\n* [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] \u2013 [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/index.html#S\u00edntese%20Biogr\u00e1fica Published works of the General Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]\n* [[Ian Becket|Becket, Ian]] et all., ''A Guerra no Mundo'', ''Guerras e Guerrilhas desde 1945'', Lisboa, Verbo, 1983\n* D\u00e1vila, Jerry. \"Hotel Tropico: Brazil and the challenge of African Decolonization, 1950\u20131980.\" [[Duke University Press]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0822348559}}\n* [[A.

'''Overseas War''' ({{Lang|pt|Guerra do Ultramar}}) or in the [[Portuguese Empire|former colonies]] as the '''War of Liberation''' ({{Lang|pt|Guerra de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o}}), was fought between [[Portuguese military history|Portugal's military]] and the emerging [[nationalist]] movements in [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal's African colonies]] between 1961 and 1975. The Portuguese [[Fascism|fascist regime]]  at the time, the {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]}}, was overthrown by a military [[Carnation Revolution|coup in 1974]], and the change in government brought the conflict to an end. The war was a decisive [[ideology|ideological]] struggle in [[Lusophone]] Africa, surrounding nations, and mainland Portugal.\n\nThe prevalent Portuguese and international historical approach considers the Portuguese Colonial War as was perceived at the time: a single conflict fought in three separate theaters of operations: [[Angolan War of Independence|Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambican War of Independence|Mozambique]] (sometimes including the [[Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli|1954 Indian Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] and [[Annexation of Goa|1961 Indian Annexation of Goa]]) rather than a number of separate conflicts as the emergent African countries aided each other during the war.\n\nUnlike other European nations during the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese {{lang|pt|Estado Novo}} regime did not withdraw from its African colonies, or the overseas provinces ({{lang|pt|prov\u00edncias ultramarinas}}) as those territories had been officially called since 1951. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements became active: the \n[[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]], [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] in Angola, [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] in Portuguese Guinea, and the [[FRELIMO|Mozambique Liberation Front]] in Mozambique.

Hoping at first for [[gold]], they soon found that [[slave]]s were the most valuable commodity available in the region for export. The [[Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] was already well-established in the [[African slave trade]], for centuries linking it to the [[Arab slave trade]]. However, the Portuguese who had conquered the Islamic port of [[Ceuta]] in 1415 and several other towns in current day [[Morocco]] in a [[Crusade]] against Islamic neighbors, managed to successfully establish themselves in the area. But the Portuguese never established much more than a foothold in either place.\n\nIn Guinea, rival Europeans grabbed much of the trade (mainly slaves) while local African rulers confined the Portuguese to the coast. These rulers then sent enslaved Africans to the Portuguese ports, or to forts in Africa from where they were exported. Thousands of kilometers down the coast, in Angola, the Portuguese found it even harder to consolidate their early advantage against encroachments by Dutch, British and French rivals. Nevertheless, the fortified Portuguese towns of [[Luanda]] (established in 1587 with 400 Portuguese settlers) and [[Benguela]] (a fort from 1587, a town from 1617) remained almost continuously in Portuguese hands.\n\nAs in Guinea, the slave trade became the basis of the local economy in Angola. Excursions traveled ever farther inland to procure captives that were sold by African rulers; the primary source of these slaves were those captured as a result of losing a war or inter-ethnic skirmish with other African tribes. More than a million men, women and children were shipped from Angola across the Atlantic. In this region, unlike Guinea, the trade remained largely in Portuguese hands. Nearly all the slaves were destined for [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]].\n\nIn [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], reached in the 15th century by Portuguese sailors searching for a maritime [[spice trade]] route, the Portuguese settled along the coast and made their way into the hinterland as ''[[Wikt:sertanejos|sertanejos]]'' (backwoodsmen). These sertanejos lived alongside [[Swahili people|Swahili]] traders and even obtained employment among [[Shona people|Shona]] kings as interpreters and political advisers. One such ''sertanejo'' managed to travel through almost all the Shona kingdoms, including the [[Mutapa Empire]]'s (Mwenemutapa) metropolitan district, between 1512 and 1516.<ref>Oliver, p. 207</ref>\n\nBy the 1530s, small bands of Portuguese traders and [[Prospecting|prospector]]s penetrated the interior regions seeking gold, where they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete]] on the [[Zambezi River]] and tried to establish a monopoly over the gold trade. The Portuguese finally entered into direct relations with the Mwenemutapa in the 1560s.<ref>Oliver, p. 203</ref> However, the Portuguese traders and explorers settled in the coastal strip with greater success, and established strongholds safe from their main rivals in East Africa \u2013 the [[Omani Arabs]], including those of [[Zanzibar]].\n\n===Scramble for Africa and the World Wars===\n[[File:Combat de marracuene.jpg|thumb|The Battle of [[Marracuene]] in 1895]]\n[[File:Combat de Coolela.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Coolela in 1895]]\nPortugal's colonial claim to the region was recognized by the other European powers during the 1880s, during the [[Scramble for Africa]], and the final boundaries of Portuguese Africa were agreed by negotiation in Europe in 1891. At the time Portugal was in effective control of little more than the coastal strip of both Angola and Mozambique, but important inroads into the interior had been made since the first half of the 19th century. In Angola, construction of a railway from [[Luanda]] to [[Malanje]], in the fertile highlands, was started in 1885.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bismarck, Europe, and Africa : the Berlin Africa Conference 1884-1885 and the onset of partition|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=F\u00f6rster, Stig., Mommsen, Wolfgang J., 1930-2004., Robinson, Ronald, 1920-1999., German Historical Institute in London.|year=1988|isbn=0-19-920500-0|location=Oxford|pages=220|oclc=16754126}}</ref>\n\nWork began in 1903 on a commercially significant line from Benguela all the way inland to the Katanga region, aiming to provide access to the sea for the richest mining district of the Belgian Congo.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/article/benguela-more-just-current|title=Benguela - More than just a current|last=Ball|first=Peter|date=17 November 2015|website=www.theheritageportal.co.za|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref> The line reached the Congo border in 1928.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1914, both Angola and Mozambique had Portuguese army garrisons of around 2,000 men, African troops led by European officers. With the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, Portugal sent reinforcements to both colonies, because the fighting in the neighboring German African colonies was expected to spill over the borders into its territories.\n\nAfter Germany declared war on Portugal in March 1916 the Portuguese government sent more reinforcements to Mozambique (the South Africans had captured German South West Africa in 1915). These troops supported British, South African and Belgian military operations against German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]]. In December 1917, German colonial forces led by Colonel [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]] invaded Mozambique from German East Africa. Portuguese, British and Belgian forces spent all of 1918 chasing Lettow-Vorbeck and his men across Mozambique, German East Africa and [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Portugal sent a total of 40,000 reinforcements to Angola and Mozambique during World War I.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rita|first=Fernando|date=|title=The First World War in Mozambique (1914-1918)|url=http://www.portugalgrandeguerra.defesa.pt/Documents/THE%20FIRST%20WORLD%20WAR%20IN%20MOZAMBIQUE%20(1914-1918).pdf|journal=Portugal Grande Guerra|volume=|pages=11|via=}}</ref>\n\nBy this time the regime in Portugal had been through two major political upheavals: from monarchy to republic in 1910 and then to a military dictatorship after a coup in 1926. These changes resulted in a tightening of Portuguese control in Angola. In the early years of the expanded colony, there was near constant warfare between the Portuguese and the various African rulers of the region. A systematic campaign of conquest and pacification was undertaken by the Portuguese. One by one the local kingdoms were overwhelmed and abolished.\n\nBy the middle of the 1920s the whole of Angola was under control. Slavery had officially ended in Portuguese Africa, but the plantations were worked on a system of paid [[serf]]dom by African labour composed of the large majority of ethnic Africans who did not have resources to pay Portuguese taxes and were considered unemployed by the authorities. After [[World War II]] and the first decolonization events, this system gradually declined. However, paid forced labor, including labor contracts with forced relocation of people, continued in many regions of Portuguese Africa until it was finally abolished in 1961.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Sandra I.|date=2016-06-27|title=\"Now we don't have anything\": remembering Angola through the lens of American missionaries|url=http://journals.openedition.org/configuracoes/3286|journal=Configura\u00e7\u00f5es.

Portugal joined [[NATO]] as a founding member in 1949, and was integrated within the various fledgling military commands of NATO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_162352.htm|title=Portugal and NATO - 1949|last=NATO|website=NATO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nNATO's focus on preventing a conventional Soviet attack against Western Europe was to the detriment of military preparations against guerrilla uprisings in Portugal's overseas provinces that were considered essential for the survival of the nation. The integration of Portugal in NATO resulted in the formation of a military \u00e9lite that were critical in the planning and implementation of operations during the Overseas War. This \"NATO generation\" ascended quickly to the highest political positions and military command without having to provide evidence of loyalty to the regime.\n\nThe Colonial War established a split between the military structure \u2013 heavily influenced by the western powers with democratic governments \u2013 and the political power of the regime.

Instead, after a coup led by pro-U.S. forces failed to depose him, Salazar consolidated power and immediately sent reinforcements to the overseas territories, setting the stage for continued conflict in Angola. Similar scenarios would play out in other overseas Portuguese territories.\n\n==Multiethnic societies, competing ideologies, and armed conflict in Portuguese Africa==\nBy the 1950s, the European [[mainland Portugal|mainland Portuguese territory]] was inhabited by a society that was poorer and had a much higher illiteracy rate than the average Western European societies or those of North America. It was ruled by an authoritarian and conservative right-leaning dictatorship, known as the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime. By this time, the Estado Novo regime ruled both the Portuguese mainland and several centuries-old overseas territories as theoretically co-equal departments. The possessions were [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Macau]], [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]], [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]].\n\nIn reality, the relation of mainland Portuguese to their overseas possessions was that of colonial administrator to a subservient colony. Political, legislative, administrative, commercial and other institutional relations between the colonies and Portugal-based individuals and organizations were numerous, though migration to, from, and between Portugal and its overseas departments was limited in size, due principally to the long distance and low annual income of the average Portuguese as well that of the indigenous overseas populations.\n\nAn increasing number of African anti-colonial movements called for total independence of the overseas African territories from Portugal. Some, like the U.S.-backed UPA<ref>The Destruction of a Nation: United States' Policy Towards Angola Since 1945, George Wright, Pluto Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7453-1029-X|9780745310299}}</ref> wanted national [[self-determination]], while others wanted a new form of government based on Marxist principles. Portuguese leaders, including Salazar, attempted to stave off calls for independence by defending a policy of assimilation, multiracialism, and [[civilising mission]], or [[Lusotropicalism]], as a way of integrating Portuguese colonies, and their peoples, more closely with Portugal itself.<ref>[http://www.barnard.edu/history/sample%20thesis/Fine%20thesis.pdf Colorblind Colonialism?

As far back as 1919, a Portuguese delegate to the International Labour Conference in Geneva declared: \"The assimilation of the so-called inferior races, by cross-breeding, by means of the Christian religion, by the mixing of the most widely divergent elements; freedom of access to the highest offices of state, even in Europe \u2013 these are the principles which have always guided Portuguese colonisation in Asia, in Africa, in the Pacific, and previously in America.\"<ref>Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), pp. 99\u2013100</ref>\n\nAs late as the 1950s the policy of 'colorblind' access and mixing of races did not extend to all of Portugal's African territories, particularly Mozambique, where in tune with other minority white regimes of the day in southern Africa, the territory was segregated along racial lines. Strict qualification criteria ensured that less than one per cent of black Mozambicans became full Portuguese citizens.<ref>Rupiya, Martin, ''[http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/historical-context.php Historical context: war and peace in Mozambique]'', Conciliation Resources (1998), retrieved 29 May 2011</ref>\n\n=== Settlement subsidies ===\n\nNumerous subsidies were offered by the Estado Novo regime to those Portuguese who agreed to settle in Angola or Mozambique, including a special premium for each Portuguese man who agreed to marry an African woman.<ref>Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), p. 161</ref> Salazar himself was fond of restating the old Portuguese policy maxim that any indigenous resident of Portugal's African territories was in theory eligible to become a member of Portuguese government, even its President. In practice, this never took place, though trained black Africans living in Portugal's overseas African possessions were allowed to occupy positions in a variety of areas including the military, the civil service, the clergy, education, and private [[business]] - providing they had the requisite education and technical skills.\n\n[[File:Cabral 2.png|thumb|Cabo Verdean and Bissau-Guinean revolutionary [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]]]]\nWhile access to basic, secondary and technical education remained poor until the 1960s, a few Africans were able to attend schools locally or in some cases in Portugal itself.

UNIVERSIDADE DE LUANDA]</ref>); however, most of their students came from Portuguese families living in the two territories. Several personalities in Portuguese society, including one of the most idolized sports stars in Portuguese football history, a black football player from [[Portuguese East Africa]] named [[Eus\u00e9bio]], were other examples of efforts towards assimilation and multiracialism in the Post-World War II period.\n\nAccording to Mozambican historian [[Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges Coelho]],<ref>\"African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique</ref> the Portuguese colonial army was largely segregated along terms of race and ethnicity until 1960. There were originally three classes of soldier in Portuguese overseas service: commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato). These categories were renamed to 1st, 2nd and 3rd class in 1960 - which effectively corresponded to the same categories. Later, after official discrimination based on skin colour was outlawed, some Portuguese commanders such as General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]] began a process of ''Africanization'' of Portuguese forces fighting in Africa. In Portuguese Guinea, this included a large increase in African recruitment along with the establishment of all-black military formations such as the ''Black Militias'' (''Mil\u00edcias negras'') commanded by Major [[Carlos Fabi\u00e3o]] and the ''African Commando Battalion'' (''Batalh\u00e3o de Comandos Africanos'') commanded by General [[Almeida Bruno]].<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 p. 340\">Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000), {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}, p. 340</ref>\n\nWhile black African soldiers constituted a mere 18% of the total number of troops fighting in Portugal's African territories in 1961, this percentage would rise dramatically over the next thirteen years, with black soldiers constituting over 50% of all government forces fighting in Africa by April 1974. Coelho noted that perceptions of African soldiers varied a good deal among senior Portuguese commanders during the conflict in Angola, Guinea and Mozambique. General [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]], perhaps the most successful counterinsurgency commander, sought good relations with local civilians and employed African units within the framework of an organized counter-insurgency plan.<ref name=\"Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50\">Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges, ''African Troops in the Portuguese Colonial Army, 1961-1974: Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique'', Portuguese Studies Review 10 (1) (2002), pp. 129\u2013150</ref> General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], by contrast, appealed for a more political and psycho-social use of African soldiers.<ref name=\"Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50\"/> On the other hand, General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]], the most conservative of the three, appears to have doubted the reliability of African forces outside his strict control, while continuing to view African soldiers as inferior to Portuguese troops.<ref name=\"Coelho, Jo\u00e3o Paulo Borges 2002 pp. 129-50\"/><ref>Ka\u00falza de Arriaga (General), Li\u00e7\u00f5es de estrat\u00e9gia de curso de altos comandos \u2013 1966/67 (Lessons Of Strategy in the Course of High Command \u2013 1966/67), Vol. 12 (1971): As late as 1971, Ka\u00falza argued that the Portuguese government should tailor the social and political status progress of black Africans in Angola and Mozambique to the growth of the white settler population, while concluding that \"blacks are not highly intelligent, on the contrary, of all peoples of the world they are the least intelligent.\"</ref>\n\nNative African troops, although widely deployed were initially employed in subordinate roles as enlisted troops or noncommissioned officers. As the war went on, an increasing number of native Angolans rose to positions of command, though of junior rank. In the late 1950s, after 500 years of colonial rule, not only had Portugal failed to produce any native black governor, headmaster, police inspector, or professor, it had also failed to produce a single commander of senior commissioned rank in the overseas Army. Here Portuguese colonial administrators fell victim to the legacy of their own discriminatory and limited policies in education, which largely barred indigenous black Africans from an equal and adequate education until well after the outbreak of the insurgency.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 100-102\">Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), pp. 100\u2013102</ref> With illiteracy rates approaching 99 per cent and almost no African enrollment in secondary schools,<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 100-102\"/> few African candidates could qualify for Portugal's officer candidate programs; most African officers obtained their commission as the result of individual competence and valour on the battlefield.\n\nDespite these handicaps, while the overwhelming majority of black or native African soldiers served in the enlisted ranks, an increasing percentage were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers by the 1970s, including such officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose to command from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the elite all-African ''Comandos Africanos'', where he eventually became one of the most-decorated soldiers in the Portuguese Army.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the Portuguese authorities had fully perceived racial discriminatory policies and lack of investment in education as wrong and contrary to their overseas ambitions in Portuguese Africa, and willingly accepted a true [[color blindness (race)|color blindness]] policy with more spending in education and training opportunities, which started to produce a larger number of black high ranked professionals, including military personnel.\n\nAfter the World War II, as [[communist]] and [[anti-colonial]] ideologies spread across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of independence using various interpretations of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary ideology. These new movements seized on anti-Portuguese and anti-colonial sentiment<ref>[http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 Independence redux in postsocialist Mozambique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624032003/http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 |date=2009-06-24 }}, Alice Dinerman</ref> to advocate the complete overthrow of existing governmental structures in Portuguese Africa. These Marxist movements alleged that Portuguese policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of the territories' ethnic Portuguese population at the expense of local tribal control, the development of native communities, and the majority of the indigenous population, who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure to comply with government policies largely imposed from Lisbon. Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans. Statistically, Portuguese Africa's white Portuguese population were indeed wealthier and more educated than the indigenous majority.\n\nAfter conflict erupted between the UPA and MPLA and Portuguese military forces, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]<ref name=\"Kennedy\"/> advised [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] (via the US consulate in Portugal) that Portugal should abandon Portugal's African colonies. A failed Portuguese military coup known as the ''Abrilada'', attempted in an effort to overthrow the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime of Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, received covert U.S. support.<ref name=\"US involvement\"/> In response, Salazar moved to consolidate his power, ordering an immediate military response to the violence occurring in Angola.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 34\">Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961\u201374'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 34</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, Portugal rapidly increased its [[mobilization|mobilized]] forces. Under the Salazar regime, a military draft required all males to serve three years of obligatory military service; many of those called up to active military duty were deployed to combat zones in Portugal's African overseas provinces. The national service period was increased to four years in 1967, and virtually all conscripts faced a mandatory two-year tour of service in Africa.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 34\" /> The existence of the draft and likelihood of combat in African counterinsurgency operations would over time result in a sharp increase in emigration by Portuguese men seeking to avoid such service.

While the Salazar regime was rigid in its adherence to this doctrine, some movement was detectable under his successor from 1968, [[Marcelo Caetano]]. The governor-general in Guin\u00e9, General Sp\u00ednola, was permitted to explore possibilities of negotiation.

The distance from the major Angolan urban centers to the neighboring [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Zambia]] were so large that the eastern part of Angola's territory was known by the Portuguese as ''Terras do Fim do Mundo'' (the lands of the far side of the world).\n\nAnother factor was internecine struggles between three competing revolutionary movements \u2013 FNLA, MPLA, and UNITA \u2013 and their guerrilla armies. For most of the conflict, the three rebel groups spent as much time fighting each other as they did fighting the Portuguese. For example, during the 1961 ''Ferreira Incident'', a UPA patrol captured 21 MPLA insurgents as prisoners, then summarily executed them on 9 October, sparking open confrontation between the two insurgent groups.\n\nStrategy also played a role, as a successful [[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]] campaign led by General [[Francisco da Costa Gomes]] helped blunt the influence of the various revolutionary movements. Finally, as in Mozambique, Portuguese Angola was able to receive support of [[South Africa]]. South African military operations proved to be of significant assistance to Portuguese military forces in Angola, who sometimes referred to their South African counterparts as ''primos'' (cousins).\n\nSeveral unique counter-insurgency forces were developed and deployed in the campaign in Angola:\n\n* ''[[Parachute Troops School|Batalh\u00f5es de Ca\u00e7adores P\u00e1ra-quedistas]]'' (Paratrooper Hunter Battalions): employed throughout the conflicts in Africa, were the first forces to arrive in Angola when the war began.\n*''Comandos'' ([[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]]): born out of the war in Angola, they were created as an elite counter-[[guerrilla]] special forces, and later used in Guinea and Mozambique. \n* ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' ([[Special Operations Troops Centre#History|Special Hunters]]): were in Angola from the start of the conflict in 1961.\n* ''Fi\u00e9is'' (Faithfuls): a force composed by [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] exiles, black soldiers that opposed the rule of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] in Congo-Kinshasa\n* ''Leais'' (Loyals): a force composed by exiles from [[Zambia]], black soldiers that were against [[Kenneth Kaunda]]\n* ''Grupos Especiais'' ([[Special Groups (Portugal)|Special Groups]]): units of volunteer black soldiers that had commando training; also used in Mozambique\n* ''Tropas Especiais'' (Special Troops): the name of Special Groups in [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]]\n* ''[[Flechas]]'' (Arrows): a successful indigenous formation of scouts, controlled by the Portuguese secret police [[PIDE|PIDE/DGS]], and composed by [[Bushmen]] that specialized in tracking, reconnaissance and [[False flag#Pseudo-operations|pseudo-terrorist operations]]. Also employed in Mozambique, the ''Flechas'' inspired the formation of the Rhodesian [[Selous Scouts]].\n*''Grupo de Cavalaria N\u00ba1'' (1st Cavalry Group): a mounted cavalry unit, armed with the [[Heckler & Koch G3|7.62 mm Espingarda m/961]] rifle and the m/961 [[Walther P38]] pistol, tasked with reconnaissance and [[patrolling]]. The 1st was also known as the \"[[Angolan Dragoons]]\" (''Drag\u00f5es de Angola''). The Rhodesians would also later develop a similar concept of horse-mounted counter-insurgency forces, forming the [[Grey's Scouts]].\n* ''Batalh\u00e3o de Cavalaria 1927'' (1927 Cavalry Battalion): a [[tank]] unit equipped with the [[Stuart tank|M5A1 tank]]. The battalion was used for supporting infantry forces and as a [[rapid reaction force]]. Again the Rhodesians developed a similar unit, forming the [[Rhodesian Armoured Corps|Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment]].\n\n===Portuguese Guinea===\n{{Main|Guinea-Bissau War of Independence}}\n[[File:LocationGuineaBissau.svg|thumb|[[Guinea-Bissau]], formerly Portuguese Guinea, on a map of Africa]]\nIn [[Portuguese Guinea]] (also referred to as Guinea at that time), the [[Marxist]] [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC) started fighting in January 1963. Its [[guerrilla]] fighters attacked the Portuguese headquarters in [[Tite (Guinea-Bissau)|Tite]], located to the south of [[Bissau]], the capital, near the Corubal river. Similar actions quickly spread across the entire colony, requiring a strong response from the Portuguese forces.\n\nThe war in Guinea has been termed \"Portugal's Vietnam\". The PAIGC was well-trained, well-led, and equipped and received substantial support from safe havens in neighboring countries like [[Senegal]] and the Republic of [[Guinea]] (Guinea-Conakry). The jungles of Guinea and the proximity of the PAIGC's allies near the border proved to be of significant advantage in providing tactical superiority during cross-border attacks and resupply missions for the guerrillas.\nThe conflict in Portuguese Guinea involving the PAIGC guerrillas and the [[Portuguese Army]] would prove the most intense and damaging of all conflicts in the Portuguese Colonial War, blocking Portuguese attempts to pacify the disputed territory via new economic and socioeconomic policies that had been applied with some success in [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]]. In 1965 the war spread to the eastern part of Guinea; that year, the PAIGC carried out attacks in the north of the territory where at the time only the Front for the Liberation and Independence of Guinea (FLING), a minor insurgent group, was active. By this time, the PAIGC had begun to openly receive military support from [[Cuba]], [[China]] and the Soviet Union.\n\n[[File:Embarque.jpg|thumb|Portuguese troops board [[List of River-class frigates#Royal Navy (Group II)|NRP ''Nuno Trist\u00e3o'']] frigate in Portuguese Guinea, during amphibious Operation Trident (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Tridente''), 1964]]\nIn Guinea, the success of PAIGC guerrilla operations put Portuguese armed forces on the defensive, forcing them to limit their response to defending territories and cities already held. Unlike Portugal's other African territories, successful small-unit Portuguese counterinsurgency tactics were slow to evolve in Guinea. Defensive operations, where soldiers were dispersed in small numbers to guard critical buildings, farms, or infrastructure were particularly devastating to the regular Portuguese infantry, who became vulnerable to guerrilla attacks outside of populated areas by the forces of the PAIGC. They were also demoralized by the steady growth of PAIGC liberation sympathizers and recruits among the rural population. In a relatively short time, the PAIGC had succeeded in reducing Portuguese military and administrative control of the territory to a relatively small area of Guinea. The scale of this success can be seen in the fact that native Guineans in the 'liberated territories' ceased payment of debts to Portuguese landowners and the payment of taxes to the colonial administration.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144\">Humbaraci, Arslan and Muchnik, Nicole, ''Portugal's African Wars'', New York: Joseph Okpaku Publishing Co., {{ISBN|0-89388-072-8}} (1974), pp. 140\u2013144</ref> The branch stores of the ''Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril'' (CUF), ''Mario Lima Whanon'', and ''Manuel Pinto Brand\u00e3o'' companies were seized and inventoried by the PAIGC in the areas they controlled, while the use of Portuguese currency in the areas under guerrilla control was banned.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144\"/> In order to maintain the economy in the liberated territories, the PAIGC established its own administrative and governmental bureaucracy at an early stage, which organized agricultural production, educated PAIGC farmworkers on how to protect crops from destruction from aerial attack by the Portuguese Air Force, and opened ''armazens do povo'' (people's stores) to supply urgently needed tools and supplies in exchange for agricultural produce.<ref name=\"Humbaraci 1974 pp. 140-144\"/>\n\nIn 1968, General [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], the Portuguese general responsible for the Portuguese military operations in Guinea, was appointed as governor. General Sp\u00ednola began a series of civil and military reforms designed to weaken PAIGC control of the Guinea and rollback insurgent gains. This included a 'hearts and minds' propaganda campaign designed to win the trust of the indigenous population, an effort to eliminate some of the discriminatory practices against native Guineans, a massive construction campaign for public works including new schools, hospital, an improved telecommuncations and road network, and a large increase in recruitment of native Guineans into the Portuguese armed forces serving in Guinea as part of an ''Africanization'' strategy.\n\nUntil 1960, Portuguese military forces serving in Guinea were composed of units led by white officers, with commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato) serving in the enlisted ranks. General Sp\u00ednola's Africanization policy eliminated these discriminatory colour bars, and called for the integration of indigenous Guinea Africans into Portuguese military forces in Africa. Two special indigenous African counterinsurgency detachments were formed by the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]. The first of these was the African Commandos (''Comandos Africanos''), consisting of a battalion of [[Comandos|commando]]s composed entirely of black soldiers (including the officers). The second was the African Special Marines (''Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos''), [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marine]] units entirely composed of black soldiers. The African Special Marines supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea in an attempt to interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies. General Sp\u00ednola's Africanization policy also fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces, culminating the establishment of all-black military formations such as the Black Militias (''Mil\u00edcias negras'') commanded by Major [[Carlos Fabi\u00e3o]].<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 p. 340\" /> By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa, including such higher-ranking officers as Captain (later Lt. Colonel) Marcelino da Mata, a black Portuguese citizen born of Guinean parents who rose from a first sergeant in a road engineering unit to a commander in the ''Comandos Africanos''.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1960s, military tactical reforms instituted by Gen. Sp\u00ednola began to improve Portuguese counterinsurgency operations in Guinea. Naval amphibious operations were instituted to overcome some of the mobility problems inherent in the underdeveloped and marshy areas of the territory, using ''[[Portuguese Marine Corps|Destacamentos de Fuzileiros Especiais (DFE)]]'' (special marine assault detachments) as strike forces. The ''Fuzileiros Especiais'' were lightly equipped with folding-stock m/961 (G3) rifles, 37mm rocket launchers, and light machine guns such as the [[Heckler & Koch HK21]] to enhance their mobility in the difficult, swampy terrain.\n\n[[File:PAIGC posto de controlo.jpg|thumb|A PAIGC checkpoint in 1974]]\nPortugal commenced ''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Mar Verde'' or ''[[Operation Green Sea]]'' on 22 November 1970 in an attempt to overthrow [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]], the leader of the Guinea-Conakry and staunch PAIGC ally, to capture the leader of the PAIGC, [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]], and to cut off supply lines to PAIGC insurgents. The operation involved a daring raid on [[Conakry]], a PAIGC safe haven, in which 400 Portuguese ''Fuzileiros'' (amphibious assault troops) attacked the city. The attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] failed, though the Portuguese managed to destroy several PAIGC ships and free hundreds of Portuguese [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) at several large POW camps. One immediate result of ''Operation Green Sea'' was an escalation in the conflict, with countries such as [[Algeria]] and [[Nigeria]] now offering support to the PAIGC as well as the [[Soviet Union]], which sent warships to the region (known by NATO as the ''West Africa Patrol'') in a show of force calculated to deter future Portuguese amphibious attacks on the territory of the Guinea-Conakry. The [[United Nations]] passed several resolutions condemning cross-border attacks of the Portuguese military against the PAIGC guerrilla bases in both neighboring Guinea-Conakry and Senegal, like the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 290]], [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 294]] and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 295]].\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, the Portuguese forces increased their offensive posture, in the form of raids into PAIGC-controlled territory. At this time Portuguese forces also adopted unorthodox means of countering the insurgents, including attacks on the political structure of the nationalist movement. This strategy culminated in the assassination of Am\u00edlcar Cabral in January 1973. Nonetheless, the PAIGC continued to increase its strength, and began to heavily press Portuguese defense forces. This became even more apparent after the PAIGC received heavy radar-guided [[anti-aircraft weapons|anti-aircraft cannon]] and other AA munitions provided by the Soviets, including [[SA-7]] shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, all of which seriously impeded Portuguese air operations.<ref name=\"Dos Santos 2009\"/><ref>Chilcote, Ronald H., ''The Struggle for Guinea-Bissau'', ''Africa Today'', July 197?), pp. 57\u201361</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Carnation Revolution]] military coup in [[Lisbon]] on 25 April 1974, the new revolutionary leaders of Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in [[Algiers]], Algeria in which Portugal agreed to remove all troops by the end of October and to officially recognize the [[Republic of Guinea-Bissau]] government controlled by the PAIGC, on 26 August 1974 and after a series of diplomatic meetings.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\">Lloyd-Jones, Stewart, and Costa Pinto, Ant\u00f3nio, ''The last empire: thirty years of Portuguese decolonization'', Portland, Oregon: Intellect Books, {{ISBN|1-84150-109-3}}, p. 22</ref> Demobilized by the departing Portuguese military authorities after the independence of Portuguese Guinea had been agreed, a total of 7,447 black Guinea-Bissauan African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC after the independence of the new African country.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\"/><ref>PAIGC, Jornal N\u00f4 Pintcha, 29 November 1980: In a statement in the party newspaper '' N\u00f4 Pintcha'' (''In the Vanguard''), a spokesman for the PAIGC revealed that many of the ex-Portuguese indigenous African soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of [[Cumer\u00e1]], [[Portogole]], and [[Mansab\u00e1]].</ref><ref name=\"Munslow, Barry 1981 pp. 109-113\">Munslow, Barry, ''The 1980 Coup in Guinea-Bissau'', Review of African Political Economy, No. 21 (May\u2013Sep., 1981), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\n===Mozambique===\n{{Main|Mozambican War of Independence}}\n[[File:LocationMozambique.svg|thumb|[[Mozambique]] within modern-day Africa.]]\n\nThe Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] was the last territory to start the war of liberation. Its nationalist movement was led by the [[Marxist-Leninist]] Liberation Front of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]), which carried out the first attack against Portuguese targets on September 25, 1964, in [[Chai, Mozambique|Chai]], [[Cabo Delgado Province]]. The fighting later spread to [[Niassa]], [[Tete]] in central Mozambique. A report from Battalion No. 558 of the Portuguese army makes references to violent actions, also in Cabo Delgado, on August 21, 1964.\n\nOn November 16 of the same year, the Portuguese troops suffered their first losses fighting in the north of the territory, in the region of [[Xilama]]. By this time, the size of the guerrilla movement had substantially increased; this, along with the low numbers of Portuguese troops and colonists, allowed a steady increase in FRELIMO's strength. It quickly started moving south in the direction of [[Meponda]] and [[Mandimba]], linking to Tete with the aid of [[Malawi]].\n\nUntil 1967 the FRELIMO showed less interest in Tete region, putting its efforts on the two northernmost districts of Mozambique where the use of [[landmines]] became very common. In the region of [[Niassa]], FRELIMO's intention was to create a free corridor to [[Zambezia Province]]. Until April 1970, the military activity of FRELIMO increased steadily, mainly due to the strategic work of [[Samora Machel]] in the region of [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]].\n\n[[Rhodesia]] was involved in the war in Mozambique, supporting the Portuguese troops in operations and conducting operations independently. By 1973, the territory was mostly under Portuguese control.<ref name=\"Portuguese Mozambique development\">[[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] (General), [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/desenvol.html O DESENVOLVIMENTO DE MO\u00c7AMBIQUE E A PROMO\u00c7\u00c3O DAS SUAS POPULA\u00c7\u00d5ES \u2013 SITUA\u00c7\u00c3O EM 1974]</ref> The Operation \"''N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio''\" ([[Gordian Knot Operation]]) - conducted in 1970 and commanded by Portuguese Brigadier General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] - a conventional-style operation to destroy the guerrilla bases in the north of Mozambique, was the major military operation of the Portuguese Colonial War. A hotly disputed issue, the Gordian Knot Operation was considered by several historians and military strategists as a failure that worsened the situation for the Portuguese. Others did not share this view, including its main architect,<ref>[http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/sucesso.html Sucesso], selected texts of Brigadier General [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] on the military success of the Portuguese military</ref> troops, and officials who had participated on both sides of the operation, including high ranked elements from the FRELIMO guerrillas. It was also described as a tremendous success of the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]].<ref>{{in lang|pt}} ''\"De acordo com as afirma\u00e7\u00f5es posteriormente produzidas por representantes qualificados da FRELIMO, este ju\u00edzo da situa\u00e7\u00e3o militar de Mo\u00e7ambique carecia de fundamento.

The reason for Arriaga's abrupt fate was an alleged incident with indigenous civilian populations, and the Portuguese government's suspicion that Arriaga was planning a military coup against Marcelo's administration in order to avoid the rise of leftist influences in Portugal and the loss of the African overseas provinces.\n\nThe construction of the [[Cahora Bassa]] Dam tied up nearly 50 percent of the Portuguese troops in Mozambique, and brought the FRELIMO to the [[Tete Province]], closer to some cities and more populated areas in the south. The FRELIMO failed, however, to halt the construction of the dam. In 1974, the FRELIMO launched mortar attacks against Vila Pery (now [[Chimoio]]), an important city and the first (and only) heavy populated area to be hit by the FRELIMO.\n\nIn Mozambique special units were also used by the Portuguese Armed Forces:\n\n* ''Grupos Especiais'' (Special Groups): locally raised counter-insurgency troops similar to those used in Angola\n* ''Grupos Especiais P\u00e1ra-Quedistas'' (Paratrooper Special Groups): units of volunteer black soldiers that were given airborne training\n* ''Grupos Especiais de Pisteiros de Combate'' (Combat Tracking Special Groups): special units trained in tracking and locating guerrillas forces\n* ''[[Flechas]]'' (Arrows), a special forces unit of the Portuguese secret police, formation of indigenous scouts and trackers, similar to the one employed in Angola\n\n===Major counter-insurgency operations===\n*1970 Mozambique \u2013 [[Gordian Knot Operation]] (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o N\u00f3 G\u00f3rdio'')\n*1970 Guinea-Bissau \u2013 [[Operation Green Sea]] (''Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Mar Verde'')\n*1971 Angola \u2013 ''[[Frente Leste]]'' (Portuguese for \"Eastern Front\")\n\n===Role of the Organisation of African Unity===\nThe [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) was founded May 1963. Its basic principles were co-operation between African nations and solidarity between African peoples. Another important objective of the OAU was an end to all forms of colonialism in Africa. This became the major objective of the organization in its first years and soon OAU pressure led to the situation in the Portuguese colonies being brought up at the [[UN Security Council]].\n\nThe OAU established a committee based in [[Dar es Salaam]], with representatives from [[Ethiopia]], [[Algeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Egypt]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zaire]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Nigeria]], to support African liberation movements. The support provided by the committee included military training and weapon supplies.\n\nThe OAU also took action in order to promote the international acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government of Angola in Exile (GRAE), composed by the FNLA. This support was transferred to the MPLA and to its leader, [[Agostinho Neto]] in 1967. In November 1972, both movements were recognized by the OAU in order to promote their merger. After 1964, the OAU recognized PAIGC as the legitimate representatives of Guinea-Bissau and [[Cape Verde]] and in 1965 recognised FRELIMO for Mozambique.\n\n==Armament and tactics==\n\n=== Portugal ===\nIn 1961 the Portuguese had 79,000 in arms \u2013 58,000 in the Army, 8,500 in the Navy and 12,500 in the Air force (Cann, 1997). These numbers grew quickly. By the end of the conflict in 1974, due to the [[Carnation Revolution]] (a military coup in Lisbon), the total in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] had risen to 217,000.\n\nPrior to their own Colonial War the Portuguese military had studied French and British efforts in Indo-China, Algeria and Malaya (Cann, 1997). Based on their analysis of operations in those theatres and considering their own situation in Africa, the Portuguese military took the unusual decision to restructure their entire armed forces, from top to bottom, for [[counterinsurgency]]. This transformation did, however, take seven years to complete and only took its final form in 1968. By 1974, the counterinsurgency efforts were successful in the Portuguese territories of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], but in [[Portuguese Guinea]] the local guerrillas were making progress. As the conflict escalated, the Portuguese authorities developed progressively tougher responses, these included the [[Gordian Knot Operation]] and the [[Operation Green Sea]].\n\nWhen conflict erupted in 1961, Portuguese forces were badly equipped to cope with the demands of a counter-insurgency conflict. It was standard procedure, up to that point, to send the oldest and most obsolete material to the colonies. Thus, initial military operations were conducted using World War II radios, the old m/937 7.92mm [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser]] rifle, the Portuguese m/948 9mm [[FBP submachine gun]], and the equally elderly German m/938 7.92mm ([[MG 13]]) Dreyse and Italian [[8\u00d759mm RB Breda|8\u00d759mm RB]] m/938 ([[Breda M37]]) machine guns.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 17\">Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961\u201374'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 17</ref> Much of Portugal's older small arms came from Germany in various deliveries made mostly before World War II, including the Austrian Steyr/Erma [[MP 34]] submachine gun (m/942). Later, Portugal purchased arms and military equipment from France, West Germany, South Africa, and to a lesser extent, from Belgium, [[Israel]] and the US.\n\n[[File:G3a3.gif|thumb|A Portuguese version of [[Heckler & Koch G3|Heckler & Koch G3A3]] was used as the standard infantry weapon for most of Portugal's forces.

Instead, most infantryman used their rifles to fire individual shots. While the heavy m/961 and its relatively lengthy barrel were well-suited to patrol operations in open savannah, it tended to put Portuguese infantry at a disadvantage when clearing the low-ceilinged interiors of native buildings or huts, or when moving through thick bush, where ambush by a concealed insurgent with an automatic weapon was always a possibility. In these situations the submachine gun, hand grenade or rifle-launched grenade often became a more useful weapon than the rifle.

Several [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s were used, including the [[Panhard AML]], [[Panhard EBR]], [[Fox Armoured Car|Fox]] and (in the 1970s) the [[Bravia Chaimite|Chaimite]].\n[[File:Js-municiamento f-84.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|F-84 Thunderjet]] being loaded with ordnance in the 1960s, at Luanda Air Base.]]\n[[File:Fiat G91.jpg|thumb|The Portuguese Airforce employed [[Fiat G.91]] aircraft like this in the Portuguese Colonial War.]]\nUnlike the [[Vietnam War]], Portugal's limited national resources did not allow for widespread use of the [[helicopter]]. Only those troops involved in [[Coup de main|coups de main]] attacks (called ''golpe de m\u00e3o'' in Portuguese) \u2013 mainly [[Portuguese Army Commandos|Commandos]] and Paratroopers \u2013 would deploy by helicopter. Most deployments were either on foot or in vehicles ([[Berliet]] and [[Unimog]] trucks). The helicopters were reserved for support (in a [[gunship]] role) or [[Medical evacuation|medical evacuation (MEDEVAC)]]. The [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] was the most widely used helicopter, although the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Puma|Puma]] was also used with great success. Other aircraft were employed: for [[air support]] the [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texan]], the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] and the [[Fiat G.91]] were used, along with a quantity of [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invaders]] covertly acquired in 1965; for [[reconnaissance]] the [[Dornier Do 27]] was employed. In the transport role, the [[Portuguese Air Force]] originally used the [[Junkers Ju 52]], followed by the [[Nord Noratlas]], the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymaster]], and the [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]] (all of these aircraft were also used for Paratroop drop operations). From 1965, [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] began to purchase the Fiat G.91 to deploy to its African overseas territories of [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] in the close-support role.<ref name=\"nicollip174\">Nicolli 2003, p. 174</ref> The first 40 G.91 were purchased second-hand from the [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]], aircraft that had been produced for Greece and which differed from the rest of the Luftwaffe G.91s enough to create maintenance problems. The aircraft replaced the Portuguese F-86 Sabre.\n\nThe [[Portuguese Navy]] (particularly the [[Portuguese Marine Corps|Marines]], known as ''Fuzileiros'') made extensive use of patrol boats, [[landing craft]], and [[Zodiac Group|Zodiac]] [[inflatable boat]]s. They were employed especially in Guinea, but also in the [[Congo River]] (and other smaller rivers) in Angola and in the [[Zambezi]] (and other rivers) in Mozambique. Equipped with standard or collapsible-stock m/961 rifles, grenades, and other gear, they used small boats or patrol craft to infiltrate guerrilla positions. In an effort to intercept infiltrators, the ''Fuzileiros'' even manned small patrol craft on [[Lake Malawi]]. The Navy also used Portuguese civilian [[Cruise ship|cruisers]] as troop transports, and drafted [[Portuguese Merchant Navy]] personnel to man ships carrying troops and material and into the Marines.\n\nThere were also many [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War]] such as the [[Flechas]] and others, as mentioned above.\n\nNative black warriors were employed in Africa by the Portuguese colonial rulers since the 16th century. Portugal had employed regular native troops (''companhias indigenas'') in its colonial army since the early 19th century. After 1961, with the beginning of the colonial wars in its overseas territories, Portugal began to incorporate black Portuguese Africans into integrated units as part of the war effort in Angola, Portuguese Guinea, and Mozambique, based on concepts of multi-racialism and preservation of the empire. African participation on the Portuguese side of the conflict varied from marginal roles as laborers and informers to participation in highly trained operational combat units like the [[Flechas]]. As the war progressed, use of African counterinsurgency troops increased; on the eve of the [[Carnation Revolution|military coup of 25 April 1974]], black ethnic Africans accounted for more than 50 percent of Portuguese forces fighting the war.\n\nFrom 1961 to the end of the Colonial War, the [[paratrooper]] [[nurse]]s nicknamed ''[[Maria (given name)|Marias]]'', were women who served the Portuguese armed forces being deployed in Portuguese Africa's dangerous guerrilla-infiltrated combat zones to perform [[rescue]] operations.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} {{YouTube|GBnrbRLOMlo|Enfermeiras P\u00e1ra-Quesdistas}}, [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://greenberet.no.sapo.pt/enfermeira.htm enfermeiras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031061716/http://greenberet.no.sapo.pt/enfermeira.htm |date=2010-10-31 }}, [[Green beret]], [[sapo.pt]]</ref>\n\nThroughout the war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. The later included [[International sanctions|UN-sponsored sanctions]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]]-led defamation, and myriad boycotts and protests performed by both foreign and domestic political organizations, like the clandestine [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP). Near the end of the conflict, a report by the controversial priest [[Adrian Hastings]], alleging atrocities and war crimes of the Portuguese military, was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister [[Marcelo Caetano]] was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the [[Anglo-Portuguese alliance]] in 1973. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings's claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the \"carnation revolution\" coup in Lisbon which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974, ending the Portuguese African counter-insurgency campaigns and triggering the rapid collapse of the [[Portuguese Empire]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] (June 26, 2001)</ref>\n\n===Guerrilla movements===\n[[File:AK 47.JPG|thumb|[[AK-47]] automatic rifles were widely used by the African guerrilla movements.]]\n[[File:SKS Flickr.jpg|thumb|[[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifles]] were also used by guerrillas.]]\nThe armament of the nationalist groups came mainly from the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Eastern Europe. However, they also used small arms of U.S. manufacture (such as the .45 [[Thompson submachine gun|M1 Thompson submachine gun]]), along with British, French, and German weapons came from neighboring countries sympathetic to the rebellion. Later in the war, most guerrillas would use roughly the same infantry rifles of Soviet origin: the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] bolt-action rifle, the [[SKS]] carbine, and most importantly the [[AK-47]] series of [[7.62\u00d739mm]] automatic rifle, or Kalashnikov. Rebel forces also made extensive use of machine guns for ambush and positional defense.\n\nRapid-fire arms in use with the insurgents included the [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] [[Degtyaryov machine gun|DP-28]], the 7.62\u00d739mm [[RPD machine gun]] (the most widely used of all), the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser|8\u00d757mm Mauser]] [[MG 34]] general-purpose machine gun, together with the [[12.7\u00d7108mm]] [[DShK]] and the 7.62\u00d754mm [[SG-43 Goryunov]] heavy machine guns, [[7.62\u00d725mm Tokarev|7.62\u00d725mm]] [[PPSh-41]] and [[PPS submachine gun|PPS-43]], [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm]] [[Sa vz. 23]], [[Sterling submachine gun|Sterling]], [[MP 40]], [[MAT-49]] [[submachine gun]] operation. Support weapons included mortars, [[recoilless rifle]]s, and in particular, Soviet-made rocket launchers, the [[RPG-2]] and [[RPG-7]]. [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft (AA) weapons]] were also employed, especially by the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]] and the [[FRELIMO]]. The [[14.5\u00d7114mm]] [[ZPU]] AA cannon was the most widely used, but by far the most effective was the [[Strela 2]] missile, first introduced to guerrilla forces in Guinea in 1973 and in Mozambique the following year by Soviet technicians.\n\nThe guerrillas' AK-47 rifles and such variants were highly thought of by many Portuguese soldiers, as they were more mobile than the m/961 (G3), while permitting the user to deliver a heavy volume of automatic fire at the closer ranges typically encountered in bush warfare.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267\">Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Guerra Colonial (2000), {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}, pp. 266\u2013267</ref> The AK-47's ammunition load was also lighter.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267\"/> The average Angolan or Mozambican rebel could easily transport 150 7.62\u00d739mm cartridges (five 30-round magazines) on his person during bush operations, compared to 100 7.62\u00d751mm rounds (five 20-round magazines) typically carried by a Portuguese infantryman on patrol.<ref name=\"Afonso 2000 pp. 266-267\"/> Though a common misconception holds that Portuguese soldiers used captured AK-47 type weapons, this was only true of a few elite units for special missions. Like U.S. forces in Vietnam, ammunition resupply difficulties and the obvious danger of being mistaken for a guerrilla when firing an enemy weapon generally precluded their use.\n\n[[Land mine|Mines]] and other [[booby trap]]s were one of the principal weapons used by the insurgents against Portuguese mechanized forces to great effect, who typically patrolled the mostly unpaved roads of their territories using motor vehicles and armored scout cars.<ref>Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961-74'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 23: It is estimated that mines planted by insurgents caused about 70 per cent of all Portuguese casualties.</ref> To counter the mine threat, Portuguese engineers commenced the herculean task of tarring the rural road network.<ref>Abbott, Peter and Rodrigues, Manuel, ''Modern African Wars 2: Angola and Mozambique 1961\u201374'', Osprey Publishing (1998), p. 23</ref> Mine detection was accomplished not only by electronic mine detectors, but also by employing trained soldiers (''picadors'') walking abreast with long probes to detect nonmetallic road mines.\n\nGuerrillas in all the various revolutionary movements used a variety of mines, often combining [[Anti-tank mine|anti-tank]] with [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] mines to ambush Portuguese formations with devastating results. A common tactic was to plant large anti-vehicle mines in a roadway bordered by obvious cover, such as an irrigation ditch, then seed the ditch with anti-personnel mines. Detonation of the vehicle mine would cause Portuguese troops to deploy and seek cover in the ditch, where the anti-personnel mines would cause further casualties.\n\nIf the insurgents planned to confront the Portuguese openly, one or two heavy machine guns would be sited to sweep the ditch and other likely areas of cover. Other mines used included the [[PMN mine|PMN (Black Widow)]], [[TM-46 mine|TM-46]], and [[POMZ]]. Even amphibious mines were used such as the [[PDM series of amphibious mines|PDM]], along with numerous home-made antipersonnel wood box mines and other nonmetallic explosive devices. The impact of mining operations, in addition to causing casualties, undermined the mobility of Portuguese forces, while diverting troops and equipment from security and offensive operations to convoy protection and mine clearance missions.\n\nIn general, the PAIGC in Guinea was the best armed, trained and led of all the guerrilla movements. By 1970, it even had candidates training in the Soviet Union, learning to fly [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] jets and to operate Soviet-supplied amphibious assault crafts and [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]].\n\n==Opposition in Portugal==\nThe government presented as a general consensus that the colonies were a part of the national unity, closer to overseas provinces than to true colonies. The [[Communism|communists]] were the first party to oppose the official view, since they saw the Portuguese presence in the colonies as an act against the colonies' right to [[self determination]]. During its 5th Congress, in 1957, the illegal [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (''Partido Comunista Portugu\u00eas'' \u2013 PCP) was the first political organization to demand the immediate and total independence of the colonies.\n\nHowever, being the only truly organized opposition movement, the PCP had to play two roles. One role was that of a communist party with an anti-colonialist position; the other role was to be a cohesive force drawing together a broad spectrum of opposing parties. Therefore, it had to accede to views that didn't reflect its true anticolonial position.\n\nSeveral opposition figures outside the PCP also had anticolonial opinions, such as the candidates to the fraudulent presidential elections, like [[Norton de Matos]] (in 1949), [[Quint\u00e3o Meireles]] (in 1951) and [[Humberto Delgado]] (in 1958). The communist candidates had, obviously, the same positions. Among them were [[Rui Lu\u00eds Gomes]] and [[Arlindo Vicente]], the first would not be allowed to participate in the election and the second would support Delgado in 1958.\n\nAfter the electoral fraud of 1958, Humberto Delgado formed the [[Independent National Movement]] (''Movimento Nacional Independente'' \u2013 MNI) that, in October 1960, agreed that there was a need to prepare the people in the colonies, before giving them the right of self-determination. Despite this, no detailed policies for achieving this goal were set out.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn 1961, the n\u00ba8 of the ''Military Tribune'' had as its title \"''Let's end the war of Angola''\". The authors were linked to the [[Patriotic Action Councils]] (''Juntas de Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Patri\u00f3tica'' \u2013 JAP), supporters of Humberto Delgado, and responsible for the attack on the [[barracks of Beja]]. The [[Portuguese National Liberation Front]] (''Frente Portuguesa de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional'' \u2013 FPLN), founded in December 1962, attacked the conciliatory positions. The official feeling of the Portuguese state, despite all this, was the same: Portugal had inalienable and legitimate rights over the colonies and this was what was transmitted through the media and through the state propaganda.\n\nIn April 1964, the Directory of Democratic-Social Action (''Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Democrato-Social'' \u2013 ADS) presented a political solution rather than a military one. In agreement with this initiative in 1966, [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] suggested there should be a referendum on the overseas policy Portugal should follow, and that the referendum should be preceded by a national discussion to take place in the six months prior to the referendum.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe end of Salazar's rule in 1968, due to illness, did not prompt any change in the political panorama.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The radicalization of the opposition movements started with the younger people who also felt victimized by the continuation of the war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n=== Radicalization (early 1970s) ===\n\nThe universities played a key role in the spread of this position. Several magazines and newspapers were created, such as ''Cadernos Circunst\u00e2ncia'', ''Cadernos Necess\u00e1rios'', ''Tempo e Modo'', and ''Pol\u00e9mica'' that supported this view. The students that participated in this underground opposition faced serious consequences if caught by the PIDE \u2013 from immediate arrest to automatic conscription into a combat branch (infantry, marines, etc.) situated in the \"hot\" warzone (Guinea, Tete Province in Mozambique or eastern Angola). It was in this environment that the {{ill|Armed Revolutionary Action|pt|A\u00e7\u00e3o Revolucion\u00e1ria Armada}} (''Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Revolucion\u00e1ria Armada'' \u2013 ARA), the armed branch of the Portuguese Communist Party created in the late 1960s, and the {{ill|Revolutionary Brigades|pt|Brigadas Revolucion\u00e1rias}} (''Brigadas Revolucion\u00e1rias'' \u2013 BR), a left-wing organization, became an important{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} force of resistance against the war, carrying out multiple acts of sabotage and bombing against military targets.\n\nThe ARA began its military actions in October 1970, keeping them up until August 1972. The major actions were the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the [[NATO]] headquarters at [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in October of the same year. The BR, on its side, began armed actions on 7 November 1971, with the sabotage of the NATO base at [[Pinhal de Armeiro]], the last action being carried out 9 April 1974, against the [[Niassa]] ship which was preparing to leave Lisboa with troops to be deployed in [[Portuguese Guinea]]. The BR acted even in the colonies, placing a bomb in the Military Command of Bissau on 22 February 1974.\n\nBy the early 1970s, the Portuguese Colonial War raged on, consuming fully 40 percent of Portugal's annual budget.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 34\"/> The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal \u2013 thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.\n\nThe war in the Portuguese overseas territories of Africa was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people got weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. In addition, younger Portuguese military academy graduates resented a program introduced by [[Marcello Caetano]] whereby militia officers who completed a brief training program and had served in the overseas territories' defensive campaigns, could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates.\n\nCaetano's government had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened government budget. Thus, the group of revolutionary military insurgents started as a military professional class<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=movicapi Cronologia: Movimento dos capit\u00e3es], Centro de Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o 25 de Abril, [[University of Coimbra]]</ref> protest of [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] [[captain (land)|captains]] against a decree law: the ''Dec.

General Sp\u00ednola was invited to assume the office of President, but resigned a few months later after it became clear that his desire to set up a system of federalized home rule for the African territories was not shared by the rest of the MFA, who wanted an immediate end to the war (achievable only by granting independence to the provinces of Portuguese Africa).<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 35\"/> The 25 April coup led to a series of temporary governments, marked by a [[Nationalization#Portugal|nationalization]] of many important areas of the economy.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Monument in Coimbra to the heroes of the Portuguese Colonial War.jpg|thumb|upright|Portuguese soldier with black [[Afro-Portuguese]] child, a monument to the Portuguese Overseas Territories' Heroes (''Her\u00f3is do Ultramar''), in [[Coimbra]], Portugal.]]\nAfter the coup on April 25, 1974, while the power struggle for control of Portugal's government was occurring in Lisbon, many Portuguese Army units serving in Africa simply ceased field operations, in some cases ignoring orders to continue fighting and withdrawing into barracks, in others negotiating local ceasefire agreements with insurgents.<ref name=\"Abbott 1998 p. 35\"/>\n\nOn 26 August 1974, after a series of diplomatic meetings, Portugal and the PAIGC signed an accord in Algiers, Algeria in which Portugal agreed to remove all troops by the end of October and to recognize the Republic of Guinea-Bissau government controlled by the PAIGC.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\"/>\n\nIn June 1975, after a period of eight months under which Mozambique had been administered by a provisional government, representatives of the Portuguese government and FRELIMO signed an agreement to grant independence to Mozambique, with the president of FRELIMO to assume the presidency of the newly independent nation.

Demobilized by the Portuguese authorities and abandoned to their fate, a total of 7,447 black African soldiers who had served in Portuguese native commando forces and militia were summarily executed by the PAIGC after Portuguese forces ceased hostilities.<ref name=\"Lloyd-Jones, Stewart p. 22\"/> In a statement in the party newspaper '' N\u00f4 Pintcha'' (''In the Vanguard''), a spokesman for the PAIGC revealed that many of the ex-Portuguese indigenous African soldiers that were executed after cessation of hostilities were buried in unmarked collective graves in the woods of [[Cumer\u00e1]], [[Portogole]], and [[Mansab\u00e1]].<ref name=\"Munslow, Barry 1981 pp. 109-113\"/><ref>PAIGC, Jornal N\u00f4 Pintcha, 29 November 1980</ref>\n\nBecause the political regimes involved in wars or counterinsurgency tend to minimize unfavorable news stories about their military actions, many Portuguese remained unaware of the atrocities committed by the colonial regimes and the army. In 2007, a [[Radiotelevisao Portuguesa]] (RTP) documentary by [[Joaquim Furtado]], made public both these government-supported atrocities and the organized massacres and terror campaign policies of some pro-independence guerrilla movements or their supporters; it was watched by over a million people, a tenth of the population at the time.<ref>[http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/portugals-hidden-atrocities Concord Monitor, November 10 2007: \"Portugal's hidden atrocities; Documentary brings long-hidden brutality into public view\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523175246/http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/portugals-hidden-atrocities |date=2012-05-23 }}</ref>\n\nWith the fall of the Estado Novo regime, most Portuguese citizens, tired of the long war and their isolation from the world community under the Caetano regime, supported the decision to recognize the independence of Portuguese Africa immediately, while accepting the inevitable loss of their former overseas territories. However, controversies over the MFA coup of 25 April 1974 and the decisions made by coup leaders remain to this day.\n\n==Economic consequences of the war==\n{{See also|Economic history of Portugal}}\n[[File:nt-DE das FA e Estado.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Evolution of the expenditure of the Portuguese state with the military during the war.]]\n\nIn Portugal, government budgets increased significantly during the war years. The country's expenditure on the armed forces ballooned since the beginning of the war in 1961. The expenses were divided into ordinary and extraordinary ones; the latter were the main factor in the huge increase in the military budget. The succession of [[Marcelo Caetano]], after Salazar's incapacitation, resulted in steady increases in military spending on the African wars through 1972.<ref>Dunne, Paul, and Nikolaidou, Eftychia Nikolaidou, ''Military Spending and Economic Growth in Greece, Portugal, and Spain'', Discussion Papers 0510, Department of Economics, University of the West of England (2005)</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 1972, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] was enacted through the Decree Law ''Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 448/ /72'' and the Ministry of Defense ordinance ''Portaria 696/72'', in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&seccao=Convidados&page=1 A verdade sobre o Fundo do Ultramar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511164133/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&seccao=Convidados&page=1 |date=2013-05-11 }}, [[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]] (November 29, 2012)</ref> While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government decided to create sustainability policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. In addition, new Decree Laws (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'') were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating militia and military academy officers in the Army branches as equals.<ref name=\"infopedia_a\">{{in lang|pt}} Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MFA).

Other indicators like GDP as percentage of Western Europe would indicate that Portugal was rapidly catching up to its European neighbors. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy influenced by a new generation of technocrats, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the EC-12 average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/64.htm Economic Growth and Change], [[U.S. Library of Congress]], countrystudies.us</ref>\n\nIn 1973, on the eve of the revolution, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56 percent of the EC-12 average. In 1975, the year of maximum revolutionary turmoil, Portugal's per capita GDP declined to 52 percent of the EC-12 average. Convergence of real GDP growth toward the EC average occurred as a result of Portugal's economic resurgence since 1985. In 1991 Portugal's GDP per capita climbed to 55 percent of the EC average, exceeding by a fraction the level attained just during the worst revolutionary period.<ref name=\"countrystudies\" />\n\nFor many decades to come after independence, the economies of the three former Portuguese African territories involved in the war continued to remain problematic due to continuing internecine political conflicts and power struggles as well as inadequate agricultural production caused by disruptive government policies resulting in high birth mortality rates, widespread malnutrition, and disease. By the 21st century, the [[Human Development Index]] of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau, were among the lowest in the World, while [[Transparency International|corruption]] and [[Gini Index|social inequality]] soared.\n\nAfter 1974, the deterioration in [[central planning]] effectiveness, [[economic development]] and growth, security, education and health system efficiency, was rampant. None of the newly independent ex-Portuguese African states made any significant economic progress in the following decades, and political progress in terms of democratic processes and protection of individual human rights was either minimal or nonexistent. With few exceptions, the new regimes ranked at the bottom of human development and [[GDP per capita]] world tables. By 2002, however, the end of the [[Angolan Civil War]], combined with exploitation of the country's highly valuable natural resources, resulted in that country becoming economically successful for the first time in decades.\n\n==Films about the war==\n* ''Os Demonios de Alcacer-Quibir'' (Portugal 1975, director: Jose Fonseca da Costa).\n* ''[[Life Is Beautiful (1979 film)|La Vita \u00e8 Bella]]'' (Portugal/Italy/USSR 1979), director: [[Grigory Chukhray|Grigory Naumovich Chukhray]]).\n* ''Sorte que tal Morte'' (Portugal 1981, director: Joao Matos Silva).\n* ''Acto dos Feitos da Guine'' (Portugal 1980, director: [[Fernando Matos Silva]]).\n* ''Gestos & Fragmentos - Ensaio sobre os Militares e o Poder'' (Portugal 1982, director: Alberto Seixas Santos).\n* ''Um Adeus Portugu\u00eas'' (Portugal 1985, director: [[Joao Botelho]]).\n* ''Era Uma Vez Um Alferes'' (Portugal 1987, director: [[Luis Filipe Rocha]]).\n* ''Matar Saudades'' (Portugal 1987, director: [[Fernando Lopes Vasconcelos]])\n* ''A Idade Maior'' (Portugal 1990, director: [[Teresa Villaverde Cabral]]).\n* ''[[\"Non\", ou A V\u00e3 Gl\u00f3ria de Mandar]]'' (Portugal/France/Spain 1990, director: [[Manoel de Oliveira]]).\n* ''Ao Sul'' (Portugal 1993, director: Fernando Matos Silva).\n* ''[[Capit\u00e3es de Abril]]'' (''Captains of April'', Portugal 2000, director: [[Maria de Medeiros]]).\n* ''Assalto ao Santa Maria'' (''Assault on the Santa Maria'', Portugal 2009, director: [[Francisco Manso]]).\n\n== Documentaries ==\n* A Guerra - Colonial - do Ultramar - da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, 1st Season (Portugal 2007, director: [[Joaquim Furtado]], [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]])\n* A Guerra - Colonial - do Ultramar - da Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, 2nd Season (Portugal 2009, director: Joaquim Furtado, RTP)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angolan War of Independence]]\n* [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence]]\n* [[Mozambican War of Independence]]\n* [[Operation Gordian Knot]]\n* [[Carnation Revolution]]\n* [[Portuguese invasion of Guinea (1970)]]\n* [[Operation Vijay (1961)]] ([[Portuguese India]])\n* [[Lusophobia]]\n\n'''Portuguese military:'''\n* [[Portuguese Army Commandos]]\n* [[Special Operations Troops Centre]]\n* [[Parachute Troops School]]\n* [[Portuguese Marine Corps]]\n* [[Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War]]\n* [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]\n\n'''Contemporaneous wars:'''\n* [[Rhodesian Bush War]]\n* [[South African Border War]]\n\n'''Post-independence wars:'''\n* [[Angolan Civil War]]\n* [[Mozambican Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Afonso, Aniceto and Gomes, Carlos de Matos, ''Guerra Colonial'' (2000) {{ISBN|972-46-1192-2}}\n* [[Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]] \u2013 [http://www.cidadevirtual.pt/k-arriaga/index.html#S\u00edntese%20Biogr\u00e1fica Published works of the General Ka\u00falza de Arriaga]\n* [[Ian Becket|Becket, Ian]] et all., ''A Guerra no Mundo'', ''Guerras e Guerrilhas desde 1945'', Lisboa, Verbo, 1983\n* D\u00e1vila, Jerry. \"Hotel Tropico: Brazil and the challenge of African Decolonization, 1950\u20131980.\" [[Duke University Press]], 2010. {{ISBN|978-0822348559}}\n* [[A.

Most often topical administration means application to [[body surface area|body surfaces]] such as the [[human skin|skin]] or [[mucous membrane]]s to treat ailments via a large range of classes including [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[foams]], [[gels]], [[lotions]], and ointments.<ref name=\"University of Maryland\">{{cite web|title=Psoriasis-Treatment|url=http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_topical_therapies_psoriasis_000087_7.htm|work=Medical Reference|publisher=University of Maryland Medical System|year=2009}}</ref> Many topical medications are epicutaneous, meaning that they are applied directly to the skin. Topical medications may also be [[insufflation (medicine)|inhalational]], such as [[asthma medication]]s, or applied to the surface of tissues other than the skin, such as [[eye drops]] applied to the [[conjunctiva]], or [[ear drop]]s placed in the ear, or medications applied to the surface of a [[tooth]]. The word ''topical'' derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2]] ''topikos'', \"of a place\".\n\n==Local versus systemic effect==\nThe definition of the topical [[route of administration]] sometimes states that both the application location and the [[pharmacodynamic]] effect thereof is local.<ref name=topical>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/topical|title=topical|website=[[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary|accessdate=2017-07-30}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Applying transdermal patch.jpg|thumb|A transdermal patch which delivers medication is applied to the skin. The patch is labelled with the time and date of administration as well as the administrator's initials.]]\nIn other cases, ''topical'' is defined as applied to a localized area of the body or to the surface of a body part regardless of the location of the effect.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/topical thefreedictionary.com > topical] Citing: The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/topical|title=topical|website=dictionary.com|accessdate=2017-07-30}}</ref> By this definition, topical administration also includes [[transdermal]] application, where the substance is administered onto the skin but is [[absorption (skin)|absorbed]] into the body to attain [[systemic administration|systemic]] distribution. Such medications are generally [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] chemicals, such as [[steroid hormone]]s. Specific types include [[transdermal patch]]es which have become a popular means of administering some drugs for [[birth control]], [[Hormone therapy|hormone replacement therapy]], and prevention of [[motion sickness]]. One example of an [[antibiotic]] that may be applied topically is [[chloramphenicol]].\n\nIf defined strictly as having local effect, the topical [[route of administration]] can also include [[enteral administration]] of medications that are poorly absorbable by the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. One poorly absorbable antibiotic is [[vancomycin]], which is recommended by mouth as a treatment for severe [[Clostridium difficile colitis|''Clostridium difficile'' colitis]].<ref name=AHFS2015>{{cite web|title=Vancocin|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/vancocin.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=Sep 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Choice of base formulation==\nA medication's potency often is changed with its base. For example, some [[topical steroid]]s will be classified one or two strengths higher when moving from cream to ointment. As a rule of thumb, an ointment base is more occlusive and will drive the medication into the skin more rapidly than a solution or cream base.<ref name=\"Wolverton, SE 2001. pp563-572\">Wolverton, SE. ''Comprehensive Dermatologic Drug Therapy.'' WB Saunders. 2001. pp 563-572.</ref>\n\nThe manufacturer of each topical product has total control over the content of the base of a medication. Although containing the same active ingredients, one manufacturer's cream might be more acidic than the next, which could cause skin irritation or change its absorption rate. For example, a vaginal formulation of [[miconazole]] antifungal cream might irritate the skin less than an athlete foot formulation of miconazole cream. These variations can, on occasion, result in different [[clinical outcome]]s, even though the active ingredient is the same. No comparative potency labeling exists to ensure equal efficacy between brands of topical steroids (percentage of oil vs water dramatically affect the potency of topical steroid). Studies have confirmed that the potency of some topical steroid products may differ according to manufacturer or brand. An example of this is the case of brand name [[Valisone]] cream and [[Kenalog]] cream in clinical studies have demonstrated significantly better vasoconstrictions than some forms of this drug produced by generic drug manufacturers.<ref name=\"Wolverton, SE 2001. pp563-572\"/> However, in a simple base like an ointment, much less variation between manufacturers is common.\n\nIn [[dermatology]], the base of a topical medication is often as important as the medication itself. It is extremely important to receive a medication in the correct base, before applying to the skin. A pharmacist should not substitute an ointment for a cream, or vice versa, as the potency of the medication can change. Some physicians use a thick ointment to replace the waterproof barrier of the inflamed skin in the treatment of eczema, and a cream might not accomplish the same clinical intention\n\n==Classes==\nThere are many general classes, with no clear dividing line among similar formulations. As a result, what the manufacturer's marketing department chooses to list on the label of a topical medication might be completely different from what the form would normally be called. For example, [[Beiersdorf|Eucerin]] \"cream\" is more appropriately described as an ointment than as a cream.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Cream===\nA [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]] is an emulsion of oil and water in approximately equal proportions. It penetrates the [[stratum corneum]] outer layer of skin wall. Cream is thicker than lotion, and maintains its shape when removed from its container. It tends to be moderate in moisturizing tendency. For topical steroid products, oil-in-water emulsions are common. Creams have a significant risk of causing [[immunological sensitization]] due to [[preservative]]s and have a high rate of acceptance by patients. There is a great variation in ingredients, composition, pH, and tolerance among generic brands.<ref name=Wolverton>{{cite book|author=Wolverton, S.  |title=Comprehensive Dermatologic Drug Therapy| page= 13}}</ref>\n\n===Foam===\n[[Foam]] can be seen with topical steroid marketed for the scalp.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Gel===\n[[Gel]]s are thicker than liquids. Gels are often a semisolid [[emulsion]] and sometimes use alcohol as a solvent for the active ingredient; some gels liquefy at body temperature. Gel tends to be cellulose cut with alcohol or acetone. Gels tend to be self-drying, tend to have greatly variable ingredients between brands, and carry a significant risk of inducing hypersensitivity due to fragrances and preservatives. Gel is useful for hairy areas and body folds. In applying gel one should avoid fissures in the skin, due to the stinging effect of the alcohol base. Gel enjoys a high rate of acceptance due to its cosmetic elegance.<ref name=Wolverton />\n\n===Lotion===\n[[Lotion]]s are similar to solution but are thicker and tend to be more [[emollient]] in nature than solution. They are usually oil mixed with water, and more often than not have less alcohol than solution. Lotions can be drying if they contain a high amount of alcohol. There is a significant variability in the ingredients among different lotions.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Ointment===\n[[File:CruzRojaPomada.JPG|thumb|Metal case for Cruz Roja ointment from Mexico (beginning of the 20th century) from the permanent collection of the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]].]]\nAn '''ointment''' is a homogeneous, viscous, semi-solid preparation, most commonly a greasy, thick oil (oil 80% - water 20%) with a high viscosity, that is intended for external application to the skin or mucous membranes. Ointments have a [[water number]] that defines the maximum amount of water that it can contain. They are used as [[emollient]]s or for the application of active ingredients to the skin for protective, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes and where a degree of occlusion is desired.\n\nOintments are used topically on a variety of body surfaces. These include the [[human skin|skin]] and the [[mucous membrane]]s of the [[human eye|eye]] (an ''eye ointment''), [[Chest rub|chest]], [[vulva]], [[anus]], and [[Human nose|nose]]. An ointment may or may not be medicated.\n\nOintments are usually very moisturizing, and good for dry skin. They have a low risk of sensitization due to having few ingredients beyond the base oil or fat, and low irritation risk. There is typically little variability between brands of drugs. They are often disliked by patients due to greasiness.<ref name=Wolverton />\n\nThe vehicle of an ointment is known as the ''ointment base''. The choice of a base depends upon the clinical indication for the ointment. The different types of ointment bases are:\n\n* Absorption bases, e.g., [[beeswax]] and [[wool fat]]\n* Emulsifying bases, e.g., [[cetrimide]] and [[emulsifying wax]]\n* Hydrocarbon bases, e.g., [[ceresine]], [[microcrystalline wax]], [[Paraffin wax|hard paraffin]], and [[Petroleum jelly|soft paraffin]]\n* Vegetable oil bases, e.g., [[almond oil]], [[coconut oil]], [[olive oil]], [[peanut oil]], and [[sesame oil]]\n* Water-soluble bases, e.g., [[macrogol]]s 200, 300, 400\n\nThe medicaments are dispersed in the base and are divided after penetrating the living cells of the skin.\n\nThe water number of an ointment is the maximum quantity of water that 100g of a base can contain at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nOintments are formulated using hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or water-emulsifying bases to provide preparations that are immiscible, miscible, or emulsifiable with skin secretions. They can also be derived from hydrocarbon (fatty), absorption, water-removable, or water-soluble bases.\n\n;Evaluation of ointments{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n#Drug content\n#Release of medicament from base\n#Medicament penetration\n#Consistency of the preparation\n#Absorption of medicament into blood stream\n#Irritant effect\n\nProperties which affect choice of an ointment base are:{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n#Stability\n#Penetrability\n#Solvent property\n#Irritant effects\n#Ease of application and removal\n\n;Methods of preparation of ointments\n*'''Fusion''': In this method the ingredients are melted together in descending order of their melting points and stirred to ensure homogeneity.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n*'''Trituration''': In this finely subdivided insoluble medicaments are evenly distributed by grinding with a small amount of the base followed by dilution with gradually increasing amounts of the base.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Paste===\n[[Paste (rheology)|Paste]] combines three agents - oil, water, and powder. It is an ointment in which a powder is suspended.\n\n===Powder===\n[[Powder (substance)|Powder]]<ref>[http://www.skincarephysicians.com/eczemanet/doctor.html \"Doctor, why are you prescribing an ointment?\";] ''American Academy of Dermatology''</ref> is either the pure drug by itself (talcum powder), or is made of the drug mixed in a carrier such as corn starch or corn cob powder (Zeosorb AF - miconazole powder). Can be used as an inhaled topical ([[cocaine]] powder used in nasal surgery).\n \n===Shake lotion===\nA shake lotion is a mixture that separates into two or three parts over time. Frequently, an oil mixed with a water-based solution needs to be shaken into suspension before use and includes the instructions: \"Shake well before use\".{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Solid===\nMedication may be placed in a solid form. Examples are deodorant, antiperspirants, astringents, and hemostatic agents. Some solids melt when they reach body temperature (e.g. rectal suppositories).\n\n===Sponge===\nCertain contraceptive methods rely on [[sponge]] as a carrier of a liquid medicine. [[Lemon juice]] embedded in a sponge has been used as a primitive contraception in some cultures.\n\n===Tape===\nCordran tape is an example of a topical steroid applied under [[occlusive dressing|occlusion]] by tape. This greatly increases the potency and absorption of the topical steroid and is used to treat inflammatory skin diseases.\n\n===Tincture===\nA [[tincture]] is a skin preparation that has a high percentage of alcohol. It would normally be used as a drug vehicle if drying of the area is desired.\n\n===Topical solution===\nTopical solutions can be marketed as drops, rinses, or sprays, are generally of low viscosity, and often use alcohol or water in the base.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singh Malik|first1=D|last2=Mital|first2=N|last3=Kaur|first3=G|title=Topical drug delivery systems: a patent review.|journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|date=2016|volume=26|issue=2|pages=213\u201328|doi=10.1517/13543776.2016.1131267|pmid=26651499}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baranowski|first1=P|last2=Karolewicz|first2=B|last3=Gajda|first3=M|last4=Pluta|first4=J|title=Ophthalmic drug dosage forms: characterisation and research methods.|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1155/2014/861904|pmid=24772038|pmc=3977496}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=KA|last2=Rudmik|first2=L|title=Delivery of Topical Therapies.|journal=Advances in Oto-rhino-laryngology|date=2016|volume=79|pages=114\u201320|doi=10.1159/000445145|pmid=27466853|isbn=978-3-318-05853-6}}</ref> These are usually a powder dissolved in alcohol, water, and sometimes oil; although a solution that uses alcohol as a base ingredient, as in topical steroids, can cause drying of the skin.<ref>ansels pharmaceutical dosage form p.g # 371</ref> There is significant variability among brands, and some solutions may cause irritation, depending on the preservative(s) and fragrances used in the base.\n\nSome examples of topical solutions are given below:\n\n#Aluminium acetate topical solution: This is colorless, with a faint acetous odour and sweetish taste. It is applied topically as an astringent after dilution with 10-40 parts of water. This is used in many types of dermatologic creams, lotions, and pastes. Commercial premeasured and packed tablets and powders are available for this preparation.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n#Povidone iodine topical solution: This is a chemical complex of iodine with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The agent is a polymer with an average molecular weight of 40,000. The povidone iodine contains 10% available iodine, slowly released when applied to skin. This preparation is employed topically as a surgical scrub and non irritating antiseptic solution; its effectiveness is directly attributed to the presence and release of iodine from the complex. Commercial product: [[Betadine]] solution.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Transdermal patch===\n[[Transdermal patch]]es can be a very precise time released method of delivering a drug. Cutting a patch in half might affect the dose delivered. The release of the active component from a transdermal delivery system (patch) may be controlled by diffusion through the adhesive which covers the whole patch, by diffusion through a membrane which may only have adhesive on the patch rim or drug release may be controlled by release from a polymer matrix. Cutting a patch might cause rapid dehydration of the base of the medicine and affect the rate of diffusion.\n\n===Vapor===\nSome medications are applied as an ointment or gel, and reach the mucous membrane via vaporization. Examples are nasal [[topical decongestant]]s and smelling salt.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Medical}}\n* [[Finger tip unit]]\n* [[Liniment]]\n* [[Topical anesthetic]]\n* [[Topical antibiotic]]\n* [[Topical corticosteroids]]\n* [[Topical decongestant]]\n* [[Topical steroid]]\n* [[Unguent]]\n\n==References==\n*[[Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]]\n*Dr. David Edwards - Dentistry Microbiology Lecture series\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050513193634/http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/mussheet06.pdf History of ointments]\n\n{{Dosage forms|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Medical terminology]]\n[[Category:Routes of administration]]\n[[Category:Ointments]]\n[[Category:Drug delivery devices]]\n[[Category:Dosage forms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Medication applied to body surfaces}}\n{{About|topical medications||Topic (disambiguation)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}\n[[File:Instilling nasal medication.jpg|thumb|A medical professional applies nose drops.]]\n[[File:Instilling eye medication.jpg|thumb|Instilling eye medication]]\nA '''topical medication''' is a [[medication]] that is applied to a particular place on or in the body.

Although containing the same active ingredients, one manufacturer's cream might be more acidic than the next, which could cause skin irritation or change its absorption rate. For example, a vaginal formulation of [[miconazole]] antifungal cream might irritate the skin less than an athlete foot formulation of miconazole cream. These variations can, on occasion, result in different [[clinical outcome]]s, even though the active ingredient is the same. No comparative potency labeling exists to ensure equal efficacy between brands of topical steroids (percentage of oil vs water dramatically affect the potency of topical steroid). Studies have confirmed that the potency of some topical steroid products may differ according to manufacturer or brand. An example of this is the case of brand name [[Valisone]] cream and [[Kenalog]] cream in clinical studies have demonstrated significantly better vasoconstrictions than some forms of this drug produced by generic drug manufacturers.<ref name=\"Wolverton, SE 2001. pp563-572\"/> However, in a simple base like an ointment, much less variation between manufacturers is common.\n\nIn [[dermatology]], the base of a topical medication is often as important as the medication itself. It is extremely important to receive a medication in the correct base, before applying to the skin. A pharmacist should not substitute an ointment for a cream, or vice versa, as the potency of the medication can change. Some physicians use a thick ointment to replace the waterproof barrier of the inflamed skin in the treatment of eczema, and a cream might not accomplish the same clinical intention\n\n==Classes==\nThere are many general classes, with no clear dividing line among similar formulations. As a result, what the manufacturer's marketing department chooses to list on the label of a topical medication might be completely different from what the form would normally be called. For example, [[Beiersdorf|Eucerin]] \"cream\" is more appropriately described as an ointment than as a cream.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Cream===\nA [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]] is an emulsion of oil and water in approximately equal proportions. It penetrates the [[stratum corneum]] outer layer of skin wall. Cream is thicker than lotion, and maintains its shape when removed from its container. It tends to be moderate in moisturizing tendency. For topical steroid products, oil-in-water emulsions are common. Creams have a significant risk of causing [[immunological sensitization]] due to [[preservative]]s and have a high rate of acceptance by patients. There is a great variation in ingredients, composition, pH, and tolerance among generic brands.<ref name=Wolverton>{{cite book|author=Wolverton, S.  |title=Comprehensive Dermatologic Drug Therapy| page= 13}}</ref>\n\n===Foam===\n[[Foam]] can be seen with topical steroid marketed for the scalp.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Gel===\n[[Gel]]s are thicker than liquids. Gels are often a semisolid [[emulsion]] and sometimes use alcohol as a solvent for the active ingredient; some gels liquefy at body temperature. Gel tends to be cellulose cut with alcohol or acetone. Gels tend to be self-drying, tend to have greatly variable ingredients between brands, and carry a significant risk of inducing hypersensitivity due to fragrances and preservatives. Gel is useful for hairy areas and body folds. In applying gel one should avoid fissures in the skin, due to the stinging effect of the alcohol base. Gel enjoys a high rate of acceptance due to its cosmetic elegance.<ref name=Wolverton />\n\n===Lotion===\n[[Lotion]]s are similar to solutions but are thicker and tend to be more [[emollient]] in nature than solution. They are usually an oil mixed with water, and more often than not have less alcohol than solutions. Lotions can be drying if they contain a high amount of alcohol. There is a significant variability in the ingredients among different lotions.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Ointment===\n[[File:CruzRojaPomada.JPG|thumb|Metal case for Cruz Roja ointment from Mexico (beginning of the 20th century) from the permanent collection of the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]].]]\nAn '''ointment''' is a homogeneous, viscous, semi-solid preparation, most commonly a greasy, thick oil (oil 80% - water 20%) with a high viscosity, that is intended for external application to the skin or mucous membranes. Ointments have a [[water number]] that defines the maximum amount of water that it can contain. They are used as [[emollient]]s or for the application of active ingredients to the skin for protective, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes and where a degree of occlusion is desired.\n\nOintments are used topically on a variety of body surfaces. These include the [[human skin|skin]] and the [[mucous membrane]]s of the [[human eye|eye]] (an ''eye ointment''), [[Chest rub|chest]], [[vulva]], [[anus]], and [[Human nose|nose]]. An ointment may or may not be medicated.\n\nOintments are usually very moisturizing, and good for dry skin. They have a low risk of sensitization due to having few ingredients beyond the base oil or fat, and low irritation risk. There is typically little variability between brands of drugs. They are often disliked by patients due to greasiness.<ref name=Wolverton />\n\nThe vehicle of an ointment is known as the ''ointment base''. The choice of a base depends upon the clinical indication for the ointment. The different types of ointment bases are:\n\n* Absorption bases, e.g., [[beeswax]] and [[wool fat]]\n* Emulsifying bases, e.g., [[cetrimide]] and [[emulsifying wax]]\n* Hydrocarbon bases, e.g., [[ceresine]], [[microcrystalline wax]], [[Paraffin wax|hard paraffin]], and [[Petroleum jelly|soft paraffin]]\n* Vegetable oil bases, e.g., [[almond oil]], [[coconut oil]], [[olive oil]], [[peanut oil]], and [[sesame oil]]\n* Water-soluble bases, e.g., [[macrogol]]s 200, 300, 400\n\nThe medicaments are dispersed in the base and are divided after penetrating the living cells of the skin.\n\nThe water number of an ointment is the maximum quantity of water that 100g of a base can contain at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nOintments are formulated using hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or water-emulsifying bases to provide preparations that are immiscible, miscible, or emulsifiable with skin secretions. They can also be derived from hydrocarbon (fatty), absorption, water-removable, or water-soluble bases.\n\n;Evaluation of ointments{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n#Drug content\n#Release of medicament from base\n#Medicament penetration\n#Consistency of the preparation\n#Absorption of medicament into blood stream\n#Irritant effect\n\nProperties which affect choice of an ointment base are:{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n#Stability\n#Penetrability\n#Solvent property\n#Irritant effects\n#Ease of application and removal\n\n;Methods of preparation of ointments\n*'''Fusion''': In this method the ingredients are melted together in descending order of their melting points and stirred to ensure homogeneity.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n*'''Trituration''': In this finely subdivided insoluble medicaments are evenly distributed by grinding with a small amount of the base followed by dilution with gradually increasing amounts of the base.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Paste===\n[[Paste (rheology)|Paste]] combines three agents - oil, water, and powder. It is an ointment in which a powder is suspended.\n\n===Powder===\n[[Powder (substance)|Powder]]<ref>[http://www.skincarephysicians.com/eczemanet/doctor.html \"Doctor, why are you prescribing an ointment?\";] ''American Academy of Dermatology''</ref> is either the pure drug by itself (talcum powder), or is made of the drug mixed in a carrier such as corn starch or corn cob powder (Zeosorb AF - miconazole powder). Can be used as an inhaled topical ([[cocaine]] powder used in nasal surgery).\n \n===Shake lotion===\nA shake lotion is a mixture that separates into two or three parts over time. Frequently, an oil mixed with a water-based solution needs to be shaken into suspension before use and includes the instructions: \"Shake well before use\".{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Solid===\nMedication may be placed in a solid form. Examples are deodorant, antiperspirants, astringents, and hemostatic agents. Some solids melt when they reach body temperature (e.g. rectal suppositories).\n\n===Sponge===\nCertain contraceptive methods rely on [[sponge]] as a carrier of a liquid medicine. [[Lemon juice]] embedded in a sponge has been used as a primitive contraception in some cultures.\n\n===Tape===\nCordran tape is an example of a topical steroid applied under [[occlusive dressing|occlusion]] by tape. This greatly increases the potency and absorption of the topical steroid and is used to treat inflammatory skin diseases.\n\n===Tincture===\nA [[tincture]] is a skin preparation that has a high percentage of alcohol. It would normally be used as a drug vehicle if drying of the area is desired.\n\n===Topical solution===\nTopical solutions can be marketed as drops, rinses, or sprays, are generally of low viscosity, and often use alcohol or water in the base.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Singh Malik|first1=D|last2=Mital|first2=N|last3=Kaur|first3=G|title=Topical drug delivery systems: a patent review.|journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|date=2016|volume=26|issue=2|pages=213\u201328|doi=10.1517/13543776.2016.1131267|pmid=26651499}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baranowski|first1=P|last2=Karolewicz|first2=B|last3=Gajda|first3=M|last4=Pluta|first4=J|title=Ophthalmic drug dosage forms: characterisation and research methods.|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1155/2014/861904|pmid=24772038|pmc=3977496}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=KA|last2=Rudmik|first2=L|title=Delivery of Topical Therapies.|journal=Advances in Oto-rhino-laryngology|date=2016|volume=79|pages=114\u201320|doi=10.1159/000445145|pmid=27466853|isbn=978-3-318-05853-6}}</ref> These are usually a powder dissolved in alcohol, water, and sometimes oil; although a solution that uses alcohol as a base ingredient, as in topical steroids, can cause drying of the skin.<ref>ansels pharmaceutical dosage form p.g # 371</ref> There is significant variability among brands, and some solutions may cause irritation, depending on the preservative(s) and fragrances used in the base.\n\nSome examples of topical solutions are given below:\n\n#Aluminium acetate topical solution: This is colorless, with a faint acetous odour and sweetish taste. It is applied topically as an astringent after dilution with 10-40 parts of water. This is used in many types of dermatologic creams, lotions, and pastes. Commercial premeasured and packed tablets and powders are available for this preparation.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n#Povidone iodine topical solution: This is a chemical complex of iodine with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The agent is a polymer with an average molecular weight of 40,000. The povidone iodine contains 10% available iodine, slowly released when applied to skin. This preparation is employed topically as a surgical scrub and non irritating antiseptic solution; its effectiveness is directly attributed to the presence and release of iodine from the complex. Commercial product: [[Betadine]] solution.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Transdermal patch===\n[[Transdermal patch]]es can be a very precise time released method of delivering a drug. Cutting a patch in half might affect the dose delivered. The release of the active component from a transdermal delivery system (patch) may be controlled by diffusion through the adhesive which covers the whole patch, by diffusion through a membrane which may only have adhesive on the patch rim or drug release may be controlled by release from a polymer matrix. Cutting a patch might cause rapid dehydration of the base of the medicine and affect the rate of diffusion.\n\n===Vapor===\nSome medications are applied as an ointment or gel, and reach the mucous membrane via vaporization.

They have also performed numerous [[cover song|covers]] of popular songs, including [[War (U.S. band)|War]]'s \"[[Why Can't We Be Friends? (song)|Why Can't We Be Friends?]]\", [[Simple Minds]]' \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\", [[? & the Mysterians]]' \"[[Can't Get Enough of You Baby]]\", [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Getting Better]]\", and \"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]\" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. They also composed 2 songs for the South Korean animated film ''[[Pororo, The Racing Adventure]]'': \"Beside Myself\" and \"Everything Just Crazy\".\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:smash mouth.jpg|right|frame|250px|smash mouth]] -->\n\n==History==\n===1990\u201397: Formation and ''Fush Yu Mang''===\nSmash Mouth's roots trace back to 1990 when [[Steve Harwell]] and Kevin Coleman met. Smash Mouth was then formed in 1994 by Harwell, who had formerly played in a [[rapping|rap]] group called F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech). Coleman, who was Harwell's manager, knew guitarist [[Greg Camp]] and bassist [[Paul De Lisle]], who had both played in a local [[punk music|punk]] band, and introduced the three musicians to each other. They began rehearsing together, along with Kevin Coleman as drummer. They soon developed into a band, and named themselves [[Smashmouth offense|Smashmouth]], an [[American football]] term. During their early years, the band played largely [[rock music]].\n\nThe band's first publicity came when a demo of the song \"Nervous in the Alley\" was played by a San Jose radio station, [[KOME]]. Soon after, [[Interscope Records]] signed the band, and the group's debut album, ''[[Fush Yu Mang]]'', was released in 1997, featuring another member: the keyboardist Michael Klooster. Also, upon signing to Interscope Records, the band changed their name from Smashmouth to Smash Mouth. The album eventually went [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] led by the band's first major single \"[[Walkin' on the Sun]]\". The singles \"The Fonz\" and a cover of \"[[Why Can't We Be Friends (song)|Why Can't We Be Friends]]\" from the 1998 [[Kevin Bacon]] film ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' were also subsequently released.\n\n===1998\u20132005: Rise to fame, ''Astro Lounge'', ''Smash Mouth'', and ''Get the Picture?''===\nThe band's second album, ''[[Astro Lounge]]'', was released in 1999 and marked a change in direction, as it had less of the previous [[ska]] influence and more of a pop sound. It led to more publicity for the band, and ended up being one of the most critically acclaimed albums from the group. Supported by the hit singles \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\" (which was featured in several film soundtracks) and \"[[Then the Morning Comes]]\", ''Astro Lounge'' was eventually certified as triple platinum.\n\nAlso in 1999, ''The East Bay Sessions'' was released as a collection of early songs.  Shortly after the release of the album, drummer Kevin Coleman left the band due to back problems.  He was initially replaced by [[Michael Urbano]], who was quickly replaced by Mitch Marine for the tour supporting ''Astro Lounge'', who was subsequently replaced by Michael Urbano at the conclusion of the tour.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p215667/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Smash Mouth covered [[the Monkees]]' hit song \"[[I'm a Believer (Smash Mouth song)|I'm a Believer]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046298 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113091657/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046298 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 13, 2006 |title=Yahoo Music - Exclusive New Music and Music Videos |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was featured on both the soundtrack for ''[[Shrek]]'' (along with \"All Star\") and their [[Smash Mouth (album)|self-titled album]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/><ref>[https://emorywheel.com/smash-mouth-tries-to-escape-shrek-at-alumni-concert/ \"Smash Mouth Tries to Escape \u2018Shrek\u2019 at Alumni Concert\"]. ''The Emory Wheel'', by Naomi Keusch Baker | Sep 28, 2016</ref> The album sold fewer copies than the band's earlier works, eventually being certified [[RIAA certification|gold]]. Also in 2001, the group appeared as themselves in the climactic scene of the film ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''.\n\nIn 2003, ''Get the Picture?'' was released, featuring the singles \"You Are My Number One\", \"Hang On\" and \"Always Gets Her Way\". Smash Mouth was dropped from [[Interscope]] shortly after the release of ''Get the Picture?''. That same year, the band performed a cover of the [[Sherman Brothers]] song \"[[I Wanna Be Like You]]\" for the animated film ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''.\n\n===2005\u201311: New label, fluctuating lineup, ''Summer Girl'', and ''Magic''===\nFollowing the band's signing to [[Universal Records]], Smash Mouth released the greatest hits compilation ''[[All Star Smash Hits]]'' in 2005. The album contains some more popular songs from previous Smash Mouth albums, as well as songs from soundtrack albums which were not on the band's own releases. On certain networks and time slots, the album was advertised as having 18 tracks, including an edited version of \"Flo\" and \"Beer Goggles\". Smash Mouth played at [[Gumby]]'s Birthday Celebration in August 2005.\n\nIn December 2005, the band released a Christmas album ''[[Gift of Rock]]''. It featured covers of Christmas songs by many artists, such as [[the Kinks]] and [[the Ramones]], and one original song, \"Baggage Claim\".\n\nSmash Mouth's fifth studio album, originally to be titled ''Old Habits'', was recorded in 2005 and expected to be released in early 2006. The band had said that the album was much more like the ska punk featured on ''Fush Yu Mang'' and ''The East Bay Sessions''. In September 2005, the band performed what was tentatively going to be the album's first single, \"Getaway Car\", on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''. The album was delayed many times, in the hope of gaining publicity with Harwell's appearance on the reality show ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. Smash Mouth returned to the studio intent on improving the record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/articles/7888.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230151924/http://www.sheknows.com/articles/7888.htm|url-status=dead|title=SheKnows gets to know Smash Mouth|archivedate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> ''Old Habits'' was shelved, replaced by ''[[Summer Girl]]'', which included some remixed ''Old Habits'' tracks as well as new songs. After being delayed in much the same way ''Old Habits'' was for several months, the album was released on September 19, 2006. Smash Mouth let Sony Pictures use much of their music from ''Summer Girl'' and other songs for the movie ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'', whose opening titles credit the film's music to the band.\n\nBefore the release of ''Summer Girl'', drummer Michael Urbano left the band without warning on February 14, 2006 due to creative differences. He was initially replaced by former drummer Mitch Marine, and then by Jason Sutter, best known for his work with [[American Hi-Fi]] and [[the Rembrandts]]. The band released their new album, ''[[Summer Girl]]'', later that year. In early 2007, one year after joining the band, Sutter left Smash Mouth to play drums for former [[Soundgarden]] and [[Audioslave]] frontman [[Chris Cornell]]; fill-in drummer Marine returned to Smash Mouth.\n\nGreg Camp left the band in the summer of 2008. Smash Mouth recruited [[Leroy (musician)|Leroy Miller]] to play guitar. Leroy left in 2009 and Camp returned to the band, but in 2011 Camp left once again and this time the band recruited Sean Hurwitz. Hurwitz stayed until 2012, and was replaced by Mike Krompass.<ref>[https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/06/29/smash-mouth-still-san-joses-all-stars/ \"Smash Mouth: Still San Jose\u2019s All Stars\"].

In 2009 Mitch Marine left once again and was replaced by Urbano, who left again after only one year in 2010, and was replaced by Marine once again. Marine left yet again after a brief spell in 2010 and was replaced by [[Randy Cooke]]. Cooke was briefly replaced by Jason Sutter in 2011, then Charlie Paxson.\n\nIn June 2011, a writer at [[Something Awful]] offered $20 if the band's lead singer, Steve Harwell, would eat 24 eggs.<ref>[[Something Awful]], June 4, 2011, \"[http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/smash-mouth-eggs.php Smash Mouth: Please Eat the Eggs]\" Retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> Others on the site and on Twitter began offering additional sums, eventually targeted to various charities.

Tod Burr, former drum tech of [[Def Leppard]] and drummer of Merle Jagger, came on board in 2012 as drum and keyboard tech of Smash Mouth.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Smash Mouth headlined the [[AutoNation]] Coast to Coast rebranding event (which combined all AutoNation dealerships into a single brand) at [[Wayne Huizenga]] Park in [[Fort Lauderdale, FL]] with Michela Paige from Season 3 of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''.

(song)|Why Can't We Be Friends?]]\", [[Simple Minds]]' \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\", [[? & the Mysterians]]' \"[[Can't Get Enough of You Baby]]\", [[the Beatles]]' \"[[Getting Better]]\", and \"[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]\" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. They also composed 2 songs for the South Korean animated film ''[[Pororo, The Racing Adventure]]'': \"Beside Myself\" and \"Everything Just Crazy\".\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:smash mouth.jpg|right|frame|250px|smash mouth]] -->\n\n==History==\n===1990\u201397: Formation and ''Fush Yu Mang''===\nSmash Mouth's roots trace back to 1990 when [[Steve Harwell]] and Kevin Coleman met. Smash Mouth was then formed in 1994 by Harwell, who had formerly played in a [[rapping|rap]] group called F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech). Coleman, who was Harwell's manager, knew guitarist [[Greg Camp]] and bassist [[Paul De Lisle]], who had both played in a local [[punk music|punk]] band, and introduced the three musicians to each other. They began rehearsing together, along with Kevin Coleman as drummer. They soon developed into a band, and named themselves [[Smashmouth offense|Smashmouth]], an [[American football]] term. During their early years, the band played largely [[rock music]].\n\nThe band's first publicity came when a demo of the song \"Nervous in the Alley\" was played by a San Jose radio station, [[KOME]]. Soon after, [[Interscope Records]] signed the band, and the group's debut album, ''[[Fush Yu Mang]]'', was released in 1997, featuring another member: the keyboardist Michael Klooster. Also, upon signing to Interscope Records, the band changed their name from Smashmouth to Smash Mouth. The album eventually went [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] led by the band's first major single \"[[Walkin' on the Sun]]\". The singles \"The Fonz\" and a cover of \"[[Why Can't We Be Friends (song)|Why Can't We Be Friends]]\" from the 1998 [[Kevin Bacon]] film ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' were also subsequently released.\n\n===1998\u20132005: Rise to fame, ''Astro Lounge'', ''Smash Mouth'', and ''Get the Picture?''===\nThe band's second album, ''[[Astro Lounge]]'', was released in 1999 and marked a change in direction, as it had less of the previous [[ska]] influence and more of a pop sound. It led to more publicity for the band, and ended up being one of the most critically acclaimed albums from the group. Supported by the hit singles \"[[All Star (song)|All Star]]\" (which was featured in several film soundtracks) and \"[[Then the Morning Comes]]\", ''Astro Lounge'' was eventually certified as triple platinum.\n\nAlso in 1999, ''The East Bay Sessions'' was released as a collection of early songs.  Shortly after the release of the album, drummer Kevin Coleman left the band due to back problems.  He was initially replaced by [[Michael Urbano]], who was quickly replaced by Mitch Marine for the tour supporting ''Astro Lounge'', who was subsequently replaced by Michael Urbano at the conclusion of the tour.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p215667/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Smash Mouth covered [[the Monkees]]' hit song \"[[I'm a Believer (Smash Mouth song)|I'm a Believer]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046298 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113091657/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046298 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 13, 2006 |title=Yahoo Music - Exclusive New Music and Music Videos |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was featured on both the soundtrack for ''[[Shrek]]'' (along with \"All Star\") and their [[Smash Mouth (album)|self-titled album]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/><ref>[https://emorywheel.com/smash-mouth-tries-to-escape-shrek-at-alumni-concert/ \"Smash Mouth Tries to Escape \u2018Shrek\u2019 at Alumni Concert\"]. ''The Emory Wheel'', by Naomi Keusch Baker | Sep 28, 2016</ref> The album sold fewer copies than the band's earlier works, eventually being certified [[RIAA certification|gold]]. Also in 2001, the group appeared as themselves in the climactic scene of the film ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''.\n\nIn 2003, ''Get the Picture?'' was released, featuring the singles \"You Are My Number One\", \"Hang On\" and \"Always Gets Her Way\". Smash Mouth was dropped from [[Interscope]] shortly after the release of ''Get the Picture?''. That same year, the band performed a cover of the [[Sherman Brothers]] song \"[[I Wanna Be Like You]]\" for the animated film ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''.\n\n===2005\u201311: New label, fluctuating lineup, ''Summer Girl'', and ''Magic''===\nFollowing the band's signing to [[Universal Records]], Smash Mouth released the greatest hits compilation ''[[All Star Smash Hits]]'' in 2005. The album contains some more popular songs from previous Smash Mouth albums, as well as songs from soundtrack albums which were not on the band's own releases. On certain networks and time slots, the album was advertised as having 18 tracks, including an edited version of \"Flo\" and \"Beer Goggles\". Smash Mouth played at [[Gumby]]'s Birthday Celebration in August 2005.\n\nIn December 2005, the band released a Christmas album ''[[Gift of Rock]]''. It featured covers of Christmas songs by many artists, such as [[the Kinks]] and [[the Ramones]], and one original song, \"Baggage Claim\".\n\nSmash Mouth's fifth studio album, originally to be titled ''Old Habits'', was recorded in 2005 and expected to be released in early 2006. The band had said that the album was much more like the ska punk featured on ''Fush Yu Mang'' and ''The East Bay Sessions''. In September 2005, the band performed what was tentatively going to be the album's first single, \"Getaway Car\", on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''. The album was delayed many times, in the hope of gaining publicity with Harwell's appearance on the reality show ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. Smash Mouth returned to the studio intent on improving the record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/articles/7888.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230151924/http://www.sheknows.com/articles/7888.htm|url-status=dead|title=SheKnows gets to know Smash Mouth|archivedate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> ''Old Habits'' was shelved, replaced by ''[[Summer Girl]]'', which included some remixed ''Old Habits'' tracks as well as new songs. After being delayed in much the same way ''Old Habits'' was for several months, the album was released on September 19, 2006. Smash Mouth let Sony Pictures use much of their music from ''Summer Girl'' and other songs for the movie ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'', whose opening titles credit the film's music to the band.\n\nBefore the release of ''Summer Girl'', drummer Michael Urbano left the band without warning on February 14, 2006 due to creative differences. He was initially replaced by former drummer Mitch Marine, and then by Jason Sutter, best known for his work with [[American Hi-Fi]] and [[the Rembrandts]]. The band released their new album, ''[[Summer Girl]]'', later that year. In early 2007, one year after joining the band, Sutter left Smash Mouth to play drums for former [[Soundgarden]] and [[Audioslave]] frontman [[Chris Cornell]]; fill-in drummer Marine returned to Smash Mouth.\n\nGreg Camp left the band in the summer of 2008. Smash Mouth recruited [[Leroy (musician)|Leroy Miller]] to play guitar. Leroy left in 2009 and Camp returned to the band, but in 2011 Camp left once again and this time the band recruited Sean Hurwitz. Hurwitz stayed until 2012, and was replaced by Mike Krompass.<ref>[https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/06/29/smash-mouth-still-san-joses-all-stars/ \"Smash Mouth: Still San Jose\u2019s All Stars\"]. ''The Mercury News'', By Paul Freeman | June 29, 2011</ref> Later in 2012, Hurwitz returned. In 2009 Mitch Marine left once again and was replaced by Urbano, who left again after only one year in 2010, and was replaced by Marine once again. Marine left yet again after a brief spell in 2010 and was replaced by [[Randy Cooke]]. Cooke was briefly replaced by Jason Sutter in 2011, then Charlie Paxson.\n\nIn June 2011, a writer at [[Something Awful]] offered $20 if the band's lead singer, Steve Harwell, would eat 24 eggs.<ref>[[Something Awful]], June 4, 2011, \"[http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/smash-mouth-eggs.php Smash Mouth: Please Eat the Eggs]\" Retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> Others on the site and on Twitter began offering additional sums, eventually targeted to various charities.

Tod Burr, former drum tech of [[Def Leppard]] and drummer of Merle Jagger, came on board in 2012 as drum and keyboard tech of Smash Mouth.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Smash Mouth headlined the [[AutoNation]] Coast to Coast rebranding event (which combined all AutoNation dealerships into a single brand) at [[Wayne Huizenga]] Park in [[Fort Lauderdale, FL]] with Michela Paige from Season 3 of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''.
