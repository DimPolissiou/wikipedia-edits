Discrepancies in the early 1900s between the observed and expected orbits of Uranus and Neptune suggested that there were one or more additional [[planets beyond Neptune]]. The search for these led to the [[discovery of Pluto]] in February 1930, which was too small to explain the discrepancies.

It also has a lower inclination to the [[ecliptic]] than most other large TNOs.\n\n===Subsequent discoveries===\nAfter Pluto's discovery, American astronomer [[Tombaugh, C. W.|Clyde Tombaugh]] continued searching for some years for similar objects, but found none. For a long time, no one searched for other TNOs as it was generally believed that Pluto, which up to August 2006 was classified a planet, was the only major object beyond Neptune. Only after the 1992 discovery of a second TNO, [[15760 Albion]], did systematic searches for further such objects begin. A broad strip of the sky around the [[ecliptic]] was photographed and digitally evaluated for slowly moving objects. Hundreds of TNOs were found, with diameters in the range of 50 to 2,500 kilometers. [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], the most massive TNO, was discovered in 2005, revisiting a long-running dispute within the scientific community over the classification of large TNOs, and whether objects like Pluto can be considered planets. Pluto and Eris were eventually classified as [[dwarf planet]]s by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. In December 2018, the discovery of {{mpl|2018 VG|18}}, nicknamed \"Farout\", was announced. Farout is the most distant solar system object so-far observed and is about 120 AU away from the sun, likely taking more than 1,000 years to complete one orbit.<ref>{{cite web |title=DISCOVERY OF THE MOST DISTANT SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECT EVER OBSERVED |url=https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/farout}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:TheTransneptunians 73AU.svg|thumb|400px|Distribution of trans-Neptunian objects]]\n\nAccording to their distance from the Sun and their [[orbital parameter]]s, TNOs are classified in two large groups: the [[Kuiper belt]] objects (KBOs) and the [[scattered disc]] objects (SDOs).{{refn|group=\"nb\"|name=\"KB\"}} The diagram to the right illustrates the distribution of known trans-Neptunian objects (up to 70&nbsp;AU) in relation to the orbits of the planets and the [[Centaur (small Solar System body)|centaurs]] for reference. Different classes are represented in different colours. [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|Resonant objects]] (including [[Neptune trojan]]s) are plotted in red, [[classical Kuiper belt object]]s in blue. The scattered disc extends to the right, far beyond the diagram, with known objects at mean distances beyond 500 AU ([[90377 Sedna|Sedna]]) and aphelia beyond 1,000 AU ({{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}).\n\n=== KBOs ===\nThe Edgeworth-[[Kuiper belt]] contains objects with an average distance to the Sun of 30 to about 55&nbsp;AU, usually having close-to-circular orbits with a small inclination from the [[ecliptic]]. Edgeworth-Kuiper belt objects are further classified into the [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]], that are locked in an orbital resonance with [[Neptune]], and the [[classical Kuiper belt object]]s, also called \"cubewanos\", that have no such resonance, moving on almost circular orbits, unperturbed by Neptune. There are a large number of resonant subgroups, the largest being the [[twotino]]s (1:2 resonance) and the [[plutino]]s (2:3 resonance), named after their most prominent member, [[Pluto]]. Members of the classical Edgeworth-Kuiper belt include [[15760 Albion]], [[50000 Quaoar]] and [[Makemake]].\n[[File:Sedna orbit.svg|thumb|Sedna's orbit takes it far beyond even the Kuiper belt (30\u201350 AU), out to nearly 1,000 AU (Sun\u2013Earth distance)]]\n\n=== SDOs ===\nThe [[scattered disc]] contains objects farther from the Sun, with very eccentric and inclined orbits. These orbits are non-resonant and non-planetary-orbit-crossing. A typical example is the most-massive-known TNO, [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]. Based on the [[Tisserand parameter]] relative to Neptune (T<sub>N</sub>), the objects in the scattered disc can be further divided into the \"typical\" scattered disc objects (SDOs, Scattered-near) with a T<sub>N</sub> of less than 3, and into the [[detached objects]] (ESDOs, Scattered-extended) with a T<sub>N</sub> greater than 3. In addition, detached objects have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2<ref name=\"DES_Elliot2006\">{{cite journal|first1=J. L. |last1=Elliot |first2=S. D. |last2=Kern |first3=K.

However, the interpretations are typically ambiguous as the spectra can fit more than one model of the surface composition and depend on the unknown particle size. More significantly, the optical surfaces of small bodies are subject to modification by intense radiation, [[solar wind]] and [[micrometeorites]]. Consequently, the thin optical surface layer could be quite different from the [[regolith]] underneath, and not representative of the bulk composition of the body.\n\nSmall TNOs are thought to be low-density mixtures of rock and ice with some [[organic compound|organic]] ([[carbon]]-containing) surface material such as [[tholin]], detected in their spectra. On the other hand, the high density of {{dp|Haumea}}, 2.6\u20133.3&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, suggests a very high non-ice content (compare with [[Pluto]]'s density: 1.86&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>). The composition of some small TNOs could be similar to that of [[comet]]s. Indeed, some [[Centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]] undergo seasonal changes when they approach the Sun, making the boundary blurred ''(see [[2060 Chiron]] and [[7968 Elst\u2013Pizarro]])''.

For very large objects, with very well known orbital elements (like Pluto), diameters can be precisely measured by [[occultation]] of stars. For other large TNOs, diameters can be estimated by [[infrared|thermal]] measurements. The intensity of light illuminating the object is known (from its distance to the Sun), and one assumes that most of its surface is in thermal equilibrium (usually not a bad assumption for an airless body). For a known [[albedo]], it is possible to estimate the surface temperature, and correspondingly the intensity of heat radiation. Further, if the size of the object is known, it is possible to predict both the amount of visible light and emitted heat radiation reaching Earth. A simplifying factor is that the Sun emits almost all of its energy in visible light and at nearby frequencies, while at the cold temperatures of TNOs, the heat radiation is emitted at completely different wavelengths (the far infrared).\n\nThus there are two unknowns (albedo and size), which can be determined by two independent measurements (of the amount of reflected light and emitted infrared heat radiation). Unfortunately, TNOs are so far from the Sun that they are very cold, hence producing black-body radiation around 60 [[micrometre]]s in [[wavelength]]. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth's surface, but only from space using, e.g. the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs. For the majority of (small) objects, the diameter is estimated by assuming an albedo. However, the albedos found range from 0.50 down to 0.05, resulting in a size range of 1200\u20133700&nbsp;km for an object of [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|magnitude]] of 1.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Sizes.html |title=Conversion of Absolute Magnitude to Diameter |publisher=Minorplanetcenter.org |accessdate=2013-10-07}}</ref>\n\n== Notable objects ==\n{{main list|List of trans-Neptunian objects|List of unnumbered trans-Neptunian objects}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; width: 80%\"\n! width=130 | Object !!

It took until 1992 to discover a second trans-Neptunian object orbiting the Sun directly, [[15760 Albion]]. The most massive TNO known is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], followed by Pluto, {{dp|Haumea}}, {{dp|Makemake}}, and {{dp|Gonggong}}. More than [[Minor-planet moon#Trans-Neptunian objects|80 satellites]] have been discovered in orbit of trans-Neptunian objects.

Discrepancies in the early 1900s between the observed and expected orbits of Uranus and Neptune suggested that there were one or more additional [[planets beyond Neptune]]. The search for these led to the [[discovery of Pluto]] in February 1930, which was too small to explain the discrepancies. Revised estimates of Neptune's mass from the ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flyby in 1989 showed that the problem was spurious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/08/thirty-four-years-voyager-2-continues-explore/|title=Thirty-four years after launch, Voyager 2 continues to explore|date=August 20, 2011 |author1=Chris Gebhardt |author2=Jeff Goldader |work=NASASpaceflight}}</ref> Pluto was easiest to find because it has the highest [[apparent magnitude]] of all known trans-Neptunian objects. It also has a lower inclination to the [[ecliptic]] than most other large TNOs.\n\n===Subsequent discoveries===\nAfter Pluto's discovery, American astronomer [[Tombaugh, C. W.|Clyde Tombaugh]] continued searching for some years for similar objects, but found none. For a long time, no one searched for other TNOs as it was generally believed that Pluto, which up to August 2006 was classified a planet, was the only major object beyond Neptune. Only after the 1992 discovery of a second TNO, [[15760 Albion]], did systematic searches for further such objects begin. A broad strip of the sky around the [[ecliptic]] was photographed and digitally evaluated for slowly moving objects. Hundreds of TNOs were found, with diameters in the range of 50 to 2,500 kilometers. [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], the most massive TNO, was discovered in 2005, revisiting a long-running dispute within the scientific community over the classification of large TNOs, and whether objects like Pluto can be considered planets. Pluto and Eris were eventually classified as [[dwarf planet]]s by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. In December 2018, the discovery of {{mpl|2018 VG|18}}, nicknamed \"Farout\", was announced. Farout is the most distant solar system object so-far observed and is about 120 AU away from the sun, likely taking more than 1,000 years to complete one orbit.<ref>{{cite web |title=DISCOVERY OF THE MOST DISTANT SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECT EVER OBSERVED |url=https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/sheppard/farout}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:TheTransneptunians 73AU.svg|thumb|400px|Distribution of trans-Neptunian objects]]\n\nAccording to their distance from the Sun and their [[orbital parameter]]s, TNOs are classified in two large groups: the [[Kuiper belt]] objects (KBOs) and the [[scattered disc]] objects (SDOs).{{refn|group=\"nb\"|name=\"KB\"}} The diagram to the right illustrates the distribution of known trans-Neptunian objects (up to 70&nbsp;AU) in relation to the orbits of the planets and the [[Centaur (small Solar System body)|centaurs]] for reference. Different classes are represented in different colours. [[Resonant trans-Neptunian object|Resonant objects]] (including [[Neptune trojan]]s) are plotted in red, [[classical Kuiper belt object]]s in blue. The scattered disc extends to the right, far beyond the diagram, with known objects at mean distances beyond 500 AU ([[90377 Sedna|Sedna]]) and aphelia beyond 1,000 AU ({{mpl|(87269) 2000 OO|67}}).\n\n=== KBOs ===\nThe Edgeworth-[[Kuiper belt]] contains objects with an average distance to the Sun of 30 to about 55&nbsp;AU, usually having close-to-circular orbits with a small inclination from the [[ecliptic]]. Edgeworth-Kuiper belt objects are further classified into the [[resonant trans-Neptunian object]], that are locked in an orbital resonance with [[Neptune]], and the [[classical Kuiper belt object]]s, also called \"cubewanos\", that have no such resonance, moving on almost circular orbits, unperturbed by Neptune. There are a large number of resonant subgroups, the largest being the [[twotino]]s (1:2 resonance) and the [[plutino]]s (2:3 resonance), named after their most prominent member, [[Pluto]]. Members of the classical Edgeworth-Kuiper belt include [[15760 Albion]], [[50000 Quaoar]] and [[Makemake]].\n[[File:Sedna orbit.svg|thumb|Sedna's orbit takes it far beyond even the Kuiper belt (30\u201350 AU), out to nearly 1,000 AU (Sun\u2013Earth distance)]]\n\n=== SDOs ===\nThe [[scattered disc]] contains objects farther from the Sun, with very eccentric and inclined orbits. These orbits are non-resonant and non-planetary-orbit-crossing. A typical example is the most-massive-known TNO, [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]. Based on the [[Tisserand parameter]] relative to Neptune (T<sub>N</sub>), the objects in the scattered disc can be further divided into the \"typical\" scattered disc objects (SDOs, Scattered-near) with a T<sub>N</sub> of less than 3, and into the [[detached objects]] (ESDOs, Scattered-extended) with a T<sub>N</sub> greater than 3. In addition, detached objects have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2<ref name=\"DES_Elliot2006\">{{cite journal|first1=J. L. |last1=Elliot |first2=S. D. |last2=Kern |first3=K.

However, the interpretations are typically ambiguous as the spectra can fit more than one model of the surface composition and depend on the unknown particle size. More significantly, the optical surfaces of small bodies are subject to modification by intense radiation, [[solar wind]] and [[micrometeorites]]. Consequently, the thin optical surface layer could be quite different from the [[regolith]] underneath, and not representative of the bulk composition of the body.\n\nSmall TNOs are thought to be low-density mixtures of rock and ice with some [[organic compound|organic]] ([[carbon]]-containing) surface material such as [[tholin]], detected in their spectra. On the other hand, the high density of {{dp|Haumea}}, 2.6\u20133.3&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, suggests a very high non-ice content (compare with [[Pluto]]'s density: 1.86&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>). The composition of some small TNOs could be similar to that of [[comet]]s. Indeed, some [[Centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]] undergo seasonal changes when they approach the Sun, making the boundary blurred ''(see [[2060 Chiron]] and [[7968 Elst\u2013Pizarro]])''. However, population comparisons between centaurs and TNOs are still controversial.<ref name=\"Peixinho 2003\">{{cite journal |first=N. |last=Peixinho |first2=A. |last2=Doressoundiram |first3=A. |last3=Delsanti |first4=H. |last4=Boehnhardt |first5=M.

Neutral objects present a flat spectrum, reflecting as much red and infrared as visible spectrum.<ref name=\"Barucci ACM2005\">A. Barucci ''Trans Neptunian Objects\u2019 surface properties'', [[IAU]] Symposium No. 229, Asteroids, Comets, Meteors, Aug 2005, Rio de Janeiro</ref> Very red objects present a steep slope, reflecting much more in red and infrared.\nA recent attempt at classification (common with centaurs) uses the total of four classes from '''BB''' (blue, average B\u2212V {{=}} 0.70, V\u2212R {{=}} 0.39, e.g. [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]]) to '''RR''' (very red, B\u2212V {{=}} 1.08, V\u2212R {{=}} 0.71, e.g. [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]]) with '''BR''' and '''IR''' as intermediate classes. BR and IR differ mostly in the infrared [[Infrared astronomy#Astronomers' infrared spectrum|bands I, J and H]].\n\nTypical models of the surface include water ice, [[amorphous carbon]], [[silicate]]s and organic macromolecules, named [[tholin]]s, created by intense radiation. Four major tholins are used to fit the reddening slope:\n* Titan tholin, believed to be produced from a mixture of 90% N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) and 10% {{CH4}} (methane)\n* Triton tholin, as above but with very low (0.1%) methane content\n* (ethane) Ice tholin I, believed to be produced from a mixture of 86% {{H2O}} and 14% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> ([[ethane]])\n* (methanol) Ice tholin II, 80% H<sub>2</sub>O, 16% CH<sub>3</sub>OH ([[methanol]]) and 3% {{CO2}}\nAs an illustration of the two extreme classes BB and RR, the following compositions have been suggested\n* for Sedna (RR very red): 24% Triton tholin, 7% carbon, 10% N<sub>2</sub>, 26% methanol, and 33% methane\n* for Orcus (BB, grey/blue): 85% amorphous carbon, +4% Titan tholin, and 11% H<sub>2</sub>O ice\n\n===Size determination and distribution ===\n[[File:Selected Planemos.svg|thumb|Size comparison between the [[Moon]], Neptune's moon Triton, Pluto, several large TNOs, and the asteroid Ceres.

For very large objects, with very well known orbital elements (like Pluto), diameters can be precisely measured by [[occultation]] of stars. For other large TNOs, diameters can be estimated by [[infrared|thermal]] measurements. The intensity of light illuminating the object is known (from its distance to the Sun), and one assumes that most of its surface is in thermal equilibrium (usually not a bad assumption for an airless body). For a known [[albedo]], it is possible to estimate the surface temperature, and correspondingly the intensity of heat radiation. Further, if the size of the object is known, it is possible to predict both the amount of visible light and emitted heat radiation reaching Earth. A simplifying factor is that the Sun emits almost all of its energy in visible light and at nearby frequencies, while at the cold temperatures of TNOs, the heat radiation is emitted at completely different wavelengths (the far infrared).\n\nThus there are two unknowns (albedo and size), which can be determined by two independent measurements (of the amount of reflected light and emitted infrared heat radiation). Unfortunately, TNOs are so far from the Sun that they are very cold, hence producing black-body radiation around 60 [[micrometre]]s in [[wavelength]]. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth's surface, but only from space using, e.g. the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs. For the majority of (small) objects, the diameter is estimated by assuming an albedo. However, the albedos found range from 0.50 down to 0.05, resulting in a size range of 1200\u20133700&nbsp;km for an object of [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|magnitude]] of 1.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/lists/Sizes.html |title=Conversion of Absolute Magnitude to Diameter |publisher=Minorplanetcenter.org |accessdate=2013-10-07}}</ref>\n\n== Notable objects ==\n{{main list|List of trans-Neptunian objects|List of unnumbered trans-Neptunian objects}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; width: 80%\"\n! width=130 | Object !!

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
