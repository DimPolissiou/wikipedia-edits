The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.<ref>{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}</ref>\n\nPermutations differ from [[combination]]s, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as [[tuple]]s, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. [[Anagram]]s of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of [[finite set]]s is an important topic in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].\n\nPermutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In [[computer science]], they are used for analyzing [[sorting algorithm]]s; in [[quantum physics]], for describing states of particles; and in [[biology]], for describing [[RNA]] sequences. \n\n{{anchor|n-factorial}}The number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}&nbsp;[[factorial]], usually written as {{math|''n''!}}, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to {{math|''n''}}.\n\nTechnically, a permutation of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} is defined as a [[bijection]] from {{math|''S''}} to itself.<ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=152}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=86}}</ref>  That is, it is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''S''}} to {{math|''S''}} for which every element occurs exactly once as an [[image (mathematics)|image]] value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of {{math|''S''}} in which each element {{math|''s''}} is replaced by the corresponding {{math|''f''(''s'')}}. For example, the permutation (3,1,2) mentioned above is described by the function <math>\\alpha</math> defined as:\n\n: <math>\\alpha(1) = 3, \\quad \\alpha(2) = 1, \\quad \\alpha(3) = 2</math>.\n\nThe collection of all permutations of a set form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[symmetric group]] of the set. The group operation is the [[function composition|composition]] (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set <math>\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}</math> that are considered for studying permutations. \n\nIn elementary combinatorics, the {{math|''k''}}-permutations, or [[partial permutation]]s, are the ordered arrangements of {{math|''k''}} distinct elements selected from a set. When {{math|''k''}} is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|In the popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]], each turn of the puzzle faces creates a permutation of the surface colors.]]\n\n==History==\n[[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717\u2013786), an [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[cryptographer]], wrote the ''Book of Cryptographic Messages''.

The ''[[Lilavati]]'' by the Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara II]] contains a passage that translates to:\n<blockquote>\nThe product of multiplication of the arithmetical series beginning and increasing by unity and continued to the number of places, will be the variations of number with specific figures.<ref>{{cite journal |first=N.

Starting from two bells: \"first, ''two'' must be admitted to be varied in two ways\" which he illustrates by showing 1 2 and 2 1.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=4}}  He then explains that with three bells there are \"three times two figures to be produced out of three\" which again is illustrated.  His explanation involves \"cast away 3, and 1.2 will remain; cast away 2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and 2.3 will remain\".{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=5}}  He then moves on to four bells and repeats the casting away argument showing that there will be four different sets of three.  Effectively this is a recursive process.  He continues with five bells using the \"casting away\" method and tabulates the resulting 120 combinations.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=6\u20147}}  At this point he gives up and remarks:\n<blockquote>\nNow the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=8}}\n</blockquote>\nStedman widens the consideration of permutations; he goes on to consider the number of permutations of the letters of the alphabet and of horses from a stable of 20.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=13\u201418}}\n\nA first case in which seemingly unrelated mathematical questions were studied with the help of permutations occurred around 1770, when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the [[Polynomial#Solving polynomial equations|roots]] of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in [[Galois theory]], which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn mathematics texts it is customary to denote permutations using lowercase Greek letters. Commonly, either <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>, or <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> and <math>\\pi</math> are used.<ref name=\"Scheinerman\">{{cite book |last1=Scheinerman |first1=Edward A. |date=March 5, 2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Functions |title=Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |url-status=live |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=188 |isbn=0840049420 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205212843/https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2020 |quote=It is customary to use lowercase Greek letters (especially \u03c0, \u03c3, and \u03c4) to stand for permutations.}}</ref>\n\nPermutations can be defined as bijections from a set {{math|''S''}} onto itself. All permutations of a set with ''n'' elements form a [[symmetric group]], denoted <math>S_n</math>, where the [[group operation]] is [[Composition of functions|function composition]]. Thus for two permutations, <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> in the group <math>S_n</math>, the four group axioms hold: \n\n# [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: If <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> are in <math>S_n</math> then so is <math>\\pi\\sigma.</math> \n# [[Associativity]]: For any three permutations <math>\\pi, \\sigma, \\tau \\in S_n</math>, <math>(\\pi\\sigma)\\tau = \\pi(\\sigma\\tau).</math>\n# [[Identity element|Identity]]: There is an identity permutation, denoted <math>\\operatorname{id}</math> and defined by <math>\\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math> for all <math>x \\in S</math>.

Or only a difference of notation and preferred phrasing, between different writers?  Is it \"emphasized\" because it\u2019s important? or only for clarity?  -->\nit is emphasized that a permutation is a function that ''performs'' a rearrangement of a set and is not a rearrangement itself. The older and more elementary view holds that permutations are the rearrangements. Sometimes to distinguish these two views, the words ''active'' and ''passive'' forms, or in older terminology ''substitutions'' and ''permutations'' are used.{{sfn|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 29, footnote 3}}\n\nA permutation can be decomposed into one or more disjoint ''cycles'', that is, the [[Orbit (group theory)|orbits]], which are found by repeatedly tracing the application of the permutation on some elements. For example, the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> defined by <math>\\sigma(7) = 7</math> has a 1-cycle, <math>(\\,7\\,)</math> while the permutation <math>\\pi</math> defined by <math>\\pi(2) = 3</math> and <math>\\pi(3) = 2</math> has a 2-cycle <math>(\\,2\\,3\\,)</math> (for details on the syntax see the section [[#Cycle notation|Cycle notation]] below). In general, a cycle of length ''k'', that is, consisting of ''k'' elements, is called a ''k''-cycle.\n\nAn element in a 1-cycle <math>(\\,x\\,)</math> is called a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the permutation. A permutation with no fixed points is called a [[derangement]]. 2-cycles are called [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]]; such permutations merely exchange two elements, leaving the others fixed.\n\n==Notations==\n{{anchor|Two-line notation}} Since writing permutations elementwise, that is, as [[piecewise]] functions, is cumbersome, several notations have been invented to represent them more compactly. ''Cycle notation'' is a popular choice for many mathematicians due to its compactness and the fact that it makes a permutation's structure transparent. It is the notation used in this article unless otherwise specified, but other notations are still widely used, especially in application areas. \n\n===Two-line notation===\nIn [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s ''two-line notation'',<ref>{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation\u2014in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses\u2014for the first time in 1815.}}</ref> one lists the elements of ''S'' in the first row, and for each one its image below it in the second row. For instance, a particular permutation of the set ''S'' = {1,2,3,4,5} can be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n  2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix};</math>\nthis means that ''\u03c3'' satisfies {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(2) {{=}} 5}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(3) {{=}} 4}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(4) {{=}} 3}}, and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(5) {{=}} 1}}. The elements of ''S'' may appear in any order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\nor\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  5 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n===One-line notation===\nIf there is a \"natural\" order for the elements of ''S'',{{efn|The order is often implicitly understood. A set of integers is naturally written from smallest to largest; a set of letters is written in lexicographic order. For other sets, a natural order needs to be specified explicitly.}} say <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n</math>, then one uses this for the first row of the two-line notation:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  x_1         & x_2         & x_3         & \\cdots & x_n \\\\\n  \\sigma(x_1) & \\sigma(x_2) & \\sigma(x_3) & \\cdots & \\sigma(x_n)\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nUnder this assumption, one may omit the first row and write the permutation in ''one-line notation'' as\n: <math>(\\sigma(x_1) \\; \\sigma(x_2) \\; \\sigma(x_3) \\; \\cdots \\; \\sigma(x_n) )</math>,\nthat is, an ordered arrangement of S.<ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gerstein|1987|p=217}}</ref> Care must be taken to distinguish one-line notation from the [[#Cycle notation|cycle notation]] described below. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the ''[[Word (mathematics)|word]] representation'' of a permutation.<ref name=\"Aigner2007\"/> The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for the first row. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]]. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of ''S'' or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.\n\n===Cycle notation===\nCycle notation describes the effect of repeatedly applying the permutation on the elements of the set. It expresses the permutation as a product of [[cyclic permutation|cycles]]; since distinct cycles are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], this is referred to as \"decomposition into disjoint cycles\".{{efn|Due to the likely possibility of confusion, cycle notation is not used in conjunction with one-line notation (sequences) for permutations.}}\n\nTo write down the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> in cycle notation, one proceeds as follows:\n\n# Write an opening bracket then select an arbitrary element ''x'' of <math>S</math> and write it down: <math>(\\,x</math>\n# Then trace the orbit of ''x''; that is, write down its values under successive applications of <math>\\sigma</math>: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots</math>\n# Repeat until the value returns to ''x'' and write down a closing parenthesis rather than ''x'': <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Now continue with an element ''y'' of ''S'', not yet written down, and proceed in the same way: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)(\\,y\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Repeat until all elements of ''S'' are written in cycles.\n\nSince for every new cycle the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has:\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}5 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n1-cycles are often omitted from the cycle notation, provided that the context is clear; for any element ''x'' in ''S'' not appearing in any cycle, one implicitly assumes <math>\\sigma(x) = x</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=54}}</ref> The [[identity permutation]], which consists only of 1-cycles, can be denoted by a single 1-cycle (x), by the number 1,{{efn|1 is frequently used to represent the [[identity element]] in a non-commutative group}} or by ''id''.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2002|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=487}}</ref>\n\nA convenient feature of cycle notation is that one can find a permutation's inverse simply by reversing the order of the elements in the permutation's cycles.

[[Mikl\u00f3s B\u00f3na]] calls the following ordering choices the ''canonical cycle notation'':\n* in each cycle the ''largest'' element is listed first\n* the cycles are sorted in ''increasing'' order of their first element\n\nFor example, (312)(54)(8)(976) is a permutation in canonical cycle notation.<ref>{{harvnb|Bona|2012|loc=p.87}} [Note that the book has a typo/error here, as it gives (45) instead of (54).]</ref> The canonical cycle notation does not omit one-cycles.\n\n[[Richard P.

However this gives a ''different'' rule for multiplying permutations; this article uses the definition where the rightmost permutation is applied first.\n\n==Other uses of the term ''permutation''==\nThe concept of a permutation as an ordered arrangement admits several generalizations that are not permutations but have been called permutations in the literature.\n\n===''k''-permutations of ''n''===\nA weaker meaning of the term ''permutation'', sometimes used in elementary combinatorics texts, designates those ordered arrangements in which no element occurs more than once, but without the requirement of using all the elements from a given set. These are not permutations except in special cases, but are natural generalizations of the ordered arrangement concept. Indeed, this use often involves considering arrangements of a fixed length&nbsp;''k'' of elements taken from a given set of size ''n'', in other words, these '''''k''-permutations of ''n''''' are the different ordered arrangements of a ''k''-element subset of an ''n''-set (sometimes called '''variations''' in the older literature.{{efn|More precisely, ''variations without repetition''. The term is still common in other languages and appears in modern English most often in translation.}}) These objects are also known as '''[[Partial permutation#Restricted partial permutations|partial permutations]]''' or as '''sequences without repetition''', terms that avoid confusion with the other, more common, meaning of \"permutation\". The number of such <math>k</math>-permutations of <math>n</math> is denoted variously by such symbols as <math>P^n_k</math>,  <math>_nP_k</math>, <math>^nP_k</math>, <math>P_{n,k}</math>, or <math>P(n,k)</math>, and its value is given by the product<ref>{{cite book|author=Charalambides, Ch A.|title=Enumerative Combinatorics|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58488-290-9|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDMGA-v5G54C&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\n: <math>P(n,k) = \\underbrace{n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}_{k\\ \\mathrm{factors}}</math>,\nwhich is 0 when {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}, and otherwise is equal to\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\n\nThe product is well defined without the assumption that <math>n</math> is a non-negative integer and is of importance outside combinatorics as well; it is known as the [[Pochhammer symbol]] <math>(n)_k</math> or as the <math>k</math>-th falling factorial power <math>n^{\\underline k}</math> of <math>n</math>.\n\nThis usage of the term ''permutation'' is closely related to the term ''[[combination]]''. A ''k''-element combination of an ''n''-set ''S'' is a ''k'' element subset of ''S'', the elements of which are not ordered. By taking all the ''k'' element subsets of ''S'' and ordering each of them in all possible ways we obtain all the ''k''-permutations of ''S''. The number of ''k''-combinations of an ''n''-set, ''C''(''n'',''k''), is therefore related to the number of ''k''-permutations of ''n'' by:\n: <math>C(n,k) = \\frac{P(n,k)}{P(k,k)} = \\frac{\\tfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{\\tfrac{k!}{0!}} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\,k!}.</math>\n\nThese numbers are also known as [[binomial coefficient]]s and are denoted by <math>\\binom{n}{k}</math>.\n<!--\n\n--- Duplicate of above ... hold for possible inclusion\n\n===Counting sequences without repetition===\nIn this section, a ''k''-permutation of a set ''S'' is an ordered sequence of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. For example, given the set of letters {<tt>C</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, <tt>I</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>R</tt>}, the sequence <tt>ICE</tt> is a 3-permutation, <tt>RING</tt> and  <tt>RICE</tt> are 4-permutations, <tt>NICER</tt> and <tt>REIGN</tt> are 5-permutations, and <tt>CRINGE</tt> is a 6-permutation; since the latter uses all letters, it is a permutation of the given set in the ordinary combinatorial sense. <tt>ENGINE</tt> on the other hand is not a permutation, because of the repetitions: it uses the elements <tt>E</tt> and <tt>N</tt> twice.\n\nLet ''n'' be the size of ''S'', the number of elements available for selection. In constructing a ''k''-permutation, there are ''n''&nbsp; possible choices for the first element of the sequence, and this is then number of 1-permutations. Once it has been chosen, there are {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} elements of ''S'' left to choose from, so a second element can be chosen in {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} ways, giving a total ''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) possible 2-permutations. For each successive element of the sequence, the number of possibilities decreases by 1&nbsp; which leads to the number of\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2)  ... \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 ''k'' + 1) possible ''k''-permutations.\nThis gives in particular the number of ''n''-permutations (which contain all elements of ''S'' once, and are therefore simply permutations of ''S''):\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1,\na number that occurs so frequently in mathematics that it is given a compact notation \"''n''!\", and is called \"''n'' [[factorial]]\". These ''n''-permutations are the longest sequences without repetition of elements of ''S'', which is reflected by the fact that the above formula for the number of ''k''-permutations gives zero whenever ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n''.\n\nThe number of ''k''-permutations of a set of ''n'' elements is sometimes denoted by ''P''(''n'',''k'') or a similar notation (usually accompanied by a notation for the number of ''k''-[[combination]]s of a set of ''n'' elements in which the \"''P''\" is replaced by \"''C''\"). That notation is rarely used in other contexts than that of counting ''k''-permutations, but the expression for the number does arise in many other situations. Being a product of ''k'' factors starting at ''n'' and decreasing by unit steps, it is called the ''k''-th falling factorial power of ''n'':\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times\\cdots\\times(n-k+1),</math>\nthough many other names and notations are in use, as detailed at [[Pochhammer symbol]]. When ''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n'' the factorial power can be completed by additional factors: ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k'')!&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''!, which allows writing\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\nThe right hand side is often given as expression for the number of ''k''-permutations, but its main merit is using the compact factorial notation. Expressing a product of ''k'' factors as a quotient of potentially much larger products, where all factors in the denominator are also explicitly present in the numerator, is not particularly efficient; as a method of computation there is the additional danger of overflow or rounding errors. It should also be noted that the expression is undefined when ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n'', whereas in those cases the number ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup> of ''k''-permutations is just&nbsp;0.\n-->\n\n===Permutations with repetition===\nOrdered arrangements of the elements of a set ''S'' of length ''n'' where repetition is allowed are called [[Tuple|''n''-tuples]], but have sometimes been referred to as '''permutations with repetition''' although they are not permutations in general. They are also called [[word (mathematics)|words]] over the alphabet ''S'' in some contexts. If the set ''S'' has ''k'' elements, the number of ''n''-tuples over ''S'' is:\n:<math>k^n.</math>\nThere is no restriction on how often an element can appear in an ''n''-tuple, but if restrictions are placed on how often an element can appear, this formula is no longer valid.\n\n===Permutations of multisets===\n[[File:Permutations with repetition.svg|thumb|Permutations of multisets]]\n\nIf ''M'' is a finite [[multiset]], then a '''multiset permutation''' is an ordered arrangement of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears exactly as often as is its multiplicity in ''M''. An [[anagram]] of a word having some repeated letters is an example of a multiset permutation.{{efn|The natural order in this example is the order of the letters in the original word.}} If the multiplicities of the elements of ''M'' (taken in some order) are <math>m_1</math>, <math>m_2</math>, ..., <math>m_l</math> and their sum (i.e., the size of ''M'') is ''n'', then the number of multiset permutations of ''M'' is given by the [[Multinomial coefficient#Multinomial coefficients|multinomial coefficient]],<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=p. 46, Theorem 2.4.2}}</ref>\n:<math>{n \\choose m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_l} = \\frac{n!}{m_1!\\, m_2!\\, \\cdots\\, m_l!}= \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^l{m_i})!}\n{\\prod_{i=1}^l{m_i!} }.</math>\n\nFor example, the number of distinct anagrams of the word MISSISSIPPI is:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=47}}</ref>\n:<math>\\frac{11!}{1!\\, 4!\\, 4!\\, 2!} = 34650</math>.\n\nA '''k-permutation''' of a multiset ''M'' is a sequence of length ''k'' of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears ''at most'' its multiplicity in ''M'' times (an element's ''repetition number'').\n\n===Circular permutations===\nPermutations, when considered as arrangements, are sometimes referred to as ''linearly ordered'' arrangements. In these arrangements there is a first element, a second element, and so on. If, however, the objects are arranged in a circular manner this distinguished ordering no longer exists, that is, there is no \"first element\" in the arrangement, any element can be considered as the start of the arrangement. The arrangements of objects in a circular manner are called '''circular permutations'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=39}}</ref>{{efn|In older texts ''circular permutation'' was sometimes used as a synonym for [[cyclic permutation]], but this is no longer done. See {{harvtxt|Carmichael|1956|p=7}}}} These can be formally defined as [[equivalence classes]] of ordinary permutations of the objects, for the [[equivalence relation]] generated by moving the final element of the linear arrangement to its front.\n\nTwo circular permutations are equivalent if one can be rotated into the other (that is, cycled without changing the relative positions of the elements). The following two circular permutations on four letters are considered to be the same.\n\n<pre>\n     1           4\n   4   3       2   1\n     2           3</pre>\n\nThe circular arrangements are to be read counterclockwise, so the following two are not equivalent since no rotation can bring one to the other.\n<pre>\n     1          1\n   4   3      3   4\n     2          2</pre>\n\nThe number of circular permutations of a set ''S'' with ''n'' elements is (''n''&thinsp;\u2013&thinsp;1)!.\n\n==Properties==\nThe number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}!.\n\nThe number of {{math|''n''}}-permutations with {{math|''k''}} disjoint cycles is the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], denoted by {{math|''c''(''n'', ''k'')}}.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=97\u2013103}}\n\n===Permutation type===\nThe cycles of a permutation partition the set <math>S_n</math> so the lengths of the cycles of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> forms a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of ''n'' called the [[cycle type]] of <math>\\sigma</math>. There is a \"1\" in the cycle type for every fixed point of \u03c3, a \"2\" for every transposition, and so on. The cycle type of <math>\\beta = (\\,1\\,2\\,5\\,)(\\,3\\,4\\,)(6\\,8\\,)(\\,7\\,)</math> is (3,2,2,1) which is sometimes written in a more compact form as [1<sup>1</sup>2<sup>2</sup>3<sup>1</sup>]. <!-- Biggs notation -->\n\nThe general form is <math>[1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}]</math>, where <math>\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n</math> are the number of cycles of respective length. The number of partitions of a certain type is then given by:\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}\\alpha_1!\\alpha_2!\\dotsm \\alpha_n!}</math>.\n\n===Conjugating permutations===\nIn general, composing permutations written in cycle notation follows no easily described pattern \u2013 the cycles of the composition can be different from those being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of [[conjugacy class|conjugating]] a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> by another permutation <math>\\pi</math>, which means forming the product <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math>. Here, <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math> is the ''conjugate'' of <math>\\sigma</math> and its cycle notation can be obtained by taking the cycle notation for ''\u03c3'' and applying ''\u03c0'' to all the entries in it.{{sfn|Humphreys|1996|p=84}} It follows that two permutations are conjugate exactly when they have the same type.\n\n===Permutation order===\nThe order of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> is the smallest positive integer ''m'' so that <math>\\sigma^m = \\mathrm{id}</math>. It is the [[least common multiple]] of its cycles lengths. For example, the order of <math>(\\,1\\,3\\,2)(\\,4\\,5\\,)</math> is <math>2\\cdot3 = 6</math>.\n\n===Parity of a permutation===\nEvery permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of transpositions.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=60}}</ref>\nAlthough many such expressions for a given permutation may exist, either they all contain an even or an odd number of transpositions. Thus all permutations can be classified as [[Even and odd permutations|even or odd]] depending on this number.\n\nThis result can be extended so as to assign a ''sign'', written <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma</math>, to each permutation. <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = +1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is even and <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = -1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is odd. Then for two permutations <math>\\sigma</math> and <math>\\pi</math>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\pi) = \\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma\\cdot\\operatorname{sgn}\\pi.</math>\n\nIt follows that <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\sigma^{-1}) = +1.</math>\n\n===Matrix representation===\n[[File:Symmetric group 3; Cayley table; matrices.svg|thumb|Composition of permutations corresponds to multiplication of permutation matrices.]]\nOne can represent a permutation of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} as an ''n''\u00d7''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. There are two natural ways to do so, but only one for which multiplications of matrices corresponds to multiplication of permutations in the same order: this is the one that associates to ''\u03c3'' the matrix ''M'' whose entry ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is 1 if ''i'' = ''\u03c3''(''j''), and 0 otherwise. The resulting matrix has exactly one entry 1 in each column and in each row, and is called a ''[[permutation matrix]]''. <br />\n[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg/1000px-Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg.png Here] <small>([[:File:Symmetric group 4; permutation list with matrices.svg|file]])</small> is a list of these matrices for permutations of 4 elements. The [[Cayley table]] on the right shows these matrices for permutations of 3 elements.\n\n=== Foata's transition lemma ===\nThere is a relationship between the one-line and the canonical cycle notation. Consider the permutation <math>(\\,2\\,)(\\,3\\,1\\,)</math>, in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain the permutation <math>(2, 3, 1)</math> in one-line notation. [[Dominique Foata|Foata]]'s transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of ''n''-permutations (to itself).{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the ''fundamental bijection''.<ref name=\"Stanley2012\"/> \n\nLet <math>f</math> be the parentheses-erasing transformation. The inverse of <math>q = f(p)</math> is a bit less intuitive. Starting with the one-line notation <math>q = q_1q_2\\cdots q_n</math>, the first cycle in canonical cycle notation must start with <math>q_1</math>. As long as the subsequent elements are smaller than <math>q_1</math>, we are in the same cycle. The second cycle starts at the smallest index <math>j</math> such that <math>q_j > q_1</math>. In other words, <math>q_j</math> is larger than everything else to its left, so it is called a ''left-to-right maximum''. Every cycle in the canonical cycle notation starts with a left-to-right maximum.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\nFor example, in the one-line notation <math>(3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 7, 6)</math>, 5 is the first element larger than 3, so the first cycle must be <math>(\\,3\\,1\\,2\\,)</math>. Then 8 is the next element larger than 5, so the second cycle is <math>(\\,5\\,4\\,)</math>. Since 9 is larger than 8, <math>(\\,8\\,)</math> is a cycle by itself. Finally, 9 is larger than all the remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is <math>(\\,9\\,7\\,6\\,)</math>.\n\nAs a first corollary, the number of n-permutations with exactly ''k'' left-to-right maxima is also equal to the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], <math>c(n, k)</math>. Furthermore, Foata's mapping takes an ''n''-permutation with ''k''-weak excedances to an ''n''-permutations with {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} ascents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  For example, (2)(31) = 321 has two weak excedances (at index 1 and 2), whereas {{nowrap|''f''(321) {{=}} 231}} has one ascent (at index 1; i.e., from 2 to 3).\n\n==Permutations of totally ordered sets==\nIn some applications, the elements of the set being permuted will be compared with each other. This requires that the set ''S'' has a [[total order]] so that any two elements can be compared. The set {1, 2, ..., ''n''} is totally ordered by the usual \"\u2264\" relation and so it is the most frequently used set in these applications, but in general, any totally ordered set will do. In these applications, the ordered arrangement view of a permutation is needed to talk about the ''positions'' in a permutation.\n\nThere are a number of properties that are directly related to the total ordering of ''S''.\n\n===Ascents, descents, runs and excedances===\nAn ''ascent'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' of ''n'' is any position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' where the following value is bigger than the current one. That is, if  ''\u03c3''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub>...''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub>, then ''i'' is an ascent if ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''i''+1</sub>.\n\nFor example, the permutation 3452167 has ascents (at positions) 1, 2, 5, and 6.\n\nSimilarly, a ''descent'' is a position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' with ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, so every ''i'' with <math>1 \\leq i<n</math> either is an ascent or  is a descent of&nbsp;''\u03c3''.\n\nAn ''ascending run'' of a permutation is a nonempty increasing contiguous subsequence of the permutation that cannot be extended at either end; it corresponds to a maximal sequence of successive ascents (the latter may be empty: between two successive descents there is still an ascending run of length&nbsp;1). By contrast an ''increasing subsequence'' of a permutation is not necessarily contiguous: it is an increasing sequence of elements obtained from the permutation by omitting the values at some positions.\nFor example, the permutation 2453167 has the ascending runs 245, 3, and 167, while it has an increasing subsequence 2367.\n\nIf a permutation has ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 descents, then it must be the union of ''k'' ascending runs.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=4f}}\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' ascents is (by definition) the [[Eulerian number]] <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math>; this is also the number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' descents. Some authors however define the Eulerian number <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math> as the number of permutations with ''k'' ascending runs, which corresponds to {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pages=4\u20135}}\n\nAn excedance of a permutation ''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub>...''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub> in an index ''j'' such that {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> > ''j''}}. If the inequality is not strict (i.e., {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2265 ''j''}}), then ''j'' is called a ''weak excedance''. The number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' excedances coincides with the number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|page=25}}\n\n===Inversions===\n{{main|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n[[Image:15-Puzzle.jpg|thumb|In the [[15 puzzle]] the goal is to get the squares in ascending order.  Initial positions which have an odd number of inversions are impossible to solve.<ref name=\"Slocum\">{{cite web\n  | last1     = Slocum\n  | first1    = Jerry\n  | last2     = Weisstein\n  | first2    = Eric W.\n  | title = 15 \u2013 puzzle\n  | work = MathWorld\n  | publisher = Wolfram Research, Inc.\n  | date = 1999\n  | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/15Puzzle.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = October 4, 2014\n}}</ref>]]\n\nAn ''[[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is a pair {{nowrap|(''i'',''j'')}} of positions where the entries of a permutation are in the opposite order: {{nowrap|''i'' < ''j''}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c3_i'' > ''\u03c3_j''}}.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=43}}  So a descent is just an inversion at two adjacent positions. For example, the permutation {{nowrap|''\u03c3'' {{=}} 23154}} has three inversions: (1,3), (2,3), (4,5), for the pairs of entries (2,1), (3,1), (5,4).\n\nSometimes an inversion is defined as the pair of values {{nowrap|(''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>,''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>)}} itself whose order is reversed; this makes no difference for the ''number'' of inversions, and this pair (reversed) is also an inversion in the above sense for the inverse permutation ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree to which the entries of a permutation are out of order; it is the same for ''\u03c3'' and for ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. To bring a permutation with ''k'' inversions into order (i.e., transform it into the identity permutation), by successively applying (right-multiplication by) [[adjacent transposition]]s, is always possible and requires a sequence of ''k'' such operations. Moreover, any reasonable choice for the adjacent transpositions will work: it suffices to choose at each step a transposition of ''i'' and {{nowrap|''i'' + 1}} where ''i'' is a descent of the permutation as modified so far (so that the transposition will remove this particular descent, although it might create other descents). This is so because applying such a transposition reduces the number of inversions by&nbsp;1; as long as this number is not zero, the permutation is not the identity, so it has at least one descent. [[Bubble sort]] and [[insertion sort]] can be interpreted as particular instances of this procedure to put a sequence into order. Incidentally this procedure proves that any permutation ''\u03c3'' can be written as a product of adjacent transpositions; for this one may simply reverse any sequence of such transpositions that transforms ''\u03c3'' into the identity. In fact, by enumerating all sequences of adjacent transpositions that would transform ''\u03c3'' into the identity, one obtains (after reversal) a ''complete'' list of all expressions of minimal length writing ''\u03c3'' as a product of adjacent transpositions.\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' inversions is expressed by a Mahonian number,{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|pp=43ff}} it is the coefficient of ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> in the expansion of the product\n:<math>\\prod_{m=1}^n\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}X^i = 1 \\left(1 + X\\right)\\left(1 + X + X^2\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 + X + X^2 + \\cdots + X^{n-1}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is also known (with ''q'' substituted for ''X'') as the [[q-factorial]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''n''<nowiki>]</nowiki><sub>''q''</sub>!&nbsp;. The expansion of the product appears in [[Necklace (combinatorics)]].\n\n==Permutations in computing==\n===Numbering permutations===\nOne way to represent permutations of ''n'' is by an integer ''N'' with 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n''!, provided convenient methods are given to convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when ''n'' is small enough that ''N'' can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;12, and for 64-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>, where ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> is a non-negative integer less than ''i'' (one may omit ''d''<sub>1</sub>, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express ''N'' in the ''[[factorial number system]]'', which is just a particular [[mixed radix]] representation, where for numbers up to ''n''! the bases for successive digits are ''n'', {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}}, ..., 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a [[Lehmer code]] or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin: 1em\"\n|+ Rothe diagram for <math>\\sigma = (6, 3, 8, 1, 4, 9, 7, 2, 5)</math>\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|<sub>''i''</sub>| <sup>''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}}\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 1\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 2\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 3\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 4\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 5\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 6\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 7\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 8\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 9\n!

More precisely, each ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> gives the number of ''remaining'' elements strictly less than the term ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. Since those remaining elements are bound to turn up as some later term ''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>, the digit ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> counts the ''inversions'' (''i'',''j'') involving ''i'' as smaller index (the number of values ''j'' for which ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''j'' and ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>). The '''inversion table''' for&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is quite similar, but here ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''k''</sub> counts the number of inversions (''i'',''j'') where ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> occurs as the smaller of the two values appearing in inverted order.{{sfn|Knuth|1973|p=12}}  Both encodings can be visualized by an ''n''&nbsp;by&nbsp;''n'' '''Rothe diagram'''{{#tag:ref|[[Heinrich August Rothe|H.

The Lehmer code lists the numbers of crosses in successive rows, while the inversion table lists the numbers of crosses in successive columns; it is just the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation, and vice versa.\n\nTo effectively convert a Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into a permutation of an ordered set ''S'', one can start with a list of the elements of ''S'' in increasing order, and for ''i'' increasing from 1 to ''n'' set ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub> to the element in the list that is preceded by ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from ''d''<sub>1</sub> to ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> while inserting the elements of ''S'' from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number ''d'' from the inversion table, the element from ''S'' inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by ''d'' elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of ''S'' both in the opposite order, starting with a row of ''n'' empty slots, and at each step place the element from ''S'' into the empty slot that is preceded by ''d'' other empty slots.\n\nConverting successive natural numbers to the factorial number system produces those sequences in [[lexicographic order]] (as is the case with any mixed radix number system), and further converting them to permutations preserves the lexicographic ordering, provided the Lehmer code interpretation is used (using inversion tables, one gets a different ordering, where one starts by comparing permutations by the ''place'' of their entries 1 rather than by the value of their first entries). The sum of the numbers in the factorial number system representation gives the number of inversions of the permutation, and the parity of that sum gives the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of the permutation. Moreover, the positions of the zeroes in the inversion table give the values of left-to-right maxima of the permutation (in the example 6, 8, 9) while the positions of the zeroes in the Lehmer code are the positions of the right-to-left minima (in the example positions the 4, 8, 9 of the values 1, 2, 5); this allows computing the distribution of such extrema among all permutations. A permutation with Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> has an ascent {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 ''i''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 ''d''<sub>''i+1''</sub>}}.\n\n===Algorithms to generate permutations===\nIn computing it may be required to generate permutations of a given sequence of values. The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another question is whether possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence.\n\nAn obvious way to generate permutations of ''n'' is to generate values for the Lehmer code (possibly using the [[factorial number system]] representation of integers up to ''n''!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires ''n'' operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an [[array data structure|array]] or a [[linked list]], both require (for different reasons) about ''n''<sup>2</sup>/4 operations to perform the conversion. With ''n'' likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too much of a problem, but it turns out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in [[big O notation|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')]] time.\n\n====Random generation of permutations====\n{{Main|Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle}}\nFor generating [[random permutation]]s of a given sequence of ''n'' values, it makes no difference whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of ''n'' to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of ''n'' that result in the same permuted sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large ''n'' due to the growth of the number ''n''!, there is no reason to assume that ''n'' will be small for random generation.\n\nThe basic idea to generate a random permutation is to generate at random one of the ''n''! sequences of integers ''d''<sub>1</sub>,''d''<sub>2</sub>,...,''d''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfying {{math|0 \u2264 ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> &lt; ''i''}} (since ''d''<sub>1</sub> is always zero it may be omitted) and to convert it to a permutation through a [[bijective]] correspondence. For the latter correspondence one could interpret the (reverse) sequence as a Lehmer code, and this gives a generation method first published in 1938 by [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Frank Yates]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Fisher, R.A. |author2=Yates, F. | title = Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research\n| origyear = 1938\n| edition = 3rd\n| year = 1948\n| pages = 26\u201327\n| publisher = Oliver & Boyd\n| location = London\n| oclc = 14222135\n}}</ref>\nWhile at the time computer implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> to select an element among ''i'' remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of ''i''), rather than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one [[swap (computer science)|swaps]] the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, even though they may not occur in the same order as they did in the original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate [[induction (mathematics)|induction]]. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.\n\nThe resulting algorithm for generating a random permutation of <code>''a''[0], ''a''[1], ..., ''a''[''n'' \u2212 1]</code> can be described as follows in [[pseudocode]]:\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' ''n'' '''downto''' 2 '''do'''\n     ''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' \u2212 1 }\n     '''swap''' ''a''[''d<sub>i</sub>''] and ''a''[''i'' \u2212 1]\n\nThis can be combined with the initialization of the array <code>''a''[''i''] = ''i''</code> as follows\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 0 '''to''' ''n''\u22121 '''do'''\n     ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' }\n     ''a''[''i''] \u2190 ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>]\n     ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>] \u2190 ''i''\n\nIf ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> = ''i'', the first assignment will copy an uninitialized value, but the second will overwrite it with the correct value ''i''.\n\nHowever, Fisher-Yates is not the fastest algorithm for generating a permutation, because Fisher-Yates is essentially a sequential algorithm and \"divide and conquer\" procedures can achieve the same result in parallel.<ref>{{cite article|author1=Bacher, A. |author2=Bodini, O.|author3=Hwang, H.K.|author4=Tsai, T.H. | title = Generating Random Permutations by Coin Tossing: Classical Algorithms, New Analysis, and Modern Implementation.\n| edition = ACM Trans.

It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates each distinct multiset permutation once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the [[factorial number system]]) and converting those to permutations. It begins by sorting the sequence in (weakly) [[increasing]] order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as long as one is found. The method goes back to [[Narayana Pandit]]a in 14th century India, and has been rediscovered frequently.{{sfn|Knuth|2005|pp=1\u201326}}\n\nThe following algorithm generates the next permutation lexicographically after a given permutation. It changes the given permutation in-place.\n\n# Find the largest index ''k'' such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1]}}.  If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n# Find the largest index ''l'' greater than k such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l'']}}.\n# Swap the value of ''a''[''k''] with that of ''a''[''l''].\n# Reverse the sequence from ''a''[''k'' + 1] up to and including the final element ''a''[''n''].\nFor example, given the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] (which is in increasing order), and given that the index is [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based]], the steps are as follows:\n# Index ''k'' = 2, because 3 is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the largest index that is still less than ''a''[''k'' + 1] which is 4.\n# Index ''l'' = 3, because 4 is the only value in the sequence that is greater than 3 in order to satisfy the condition ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l''].\n# The values of ''a''[2] and ''a''[3] are swapped to form the new sequence [1,2,4,3].\n# The sequence after ''k''-index ''a''[2] to the final element is reversed. Because only one value lies after this index (the 3), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance. Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted: [1,2,4,3].\nFollowing this algorithm, the next lexicographic permutation will be [1,3,2,4], and the 24th permutation will be [4,3,2,1] at which point ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1] does not exist, indicating that this is the last permutation.\n\nThis method uses about 3 comparisons and 1.5 swaps per permutation, amortized over the whole sequence, not counting the initial sort.<ref>{{cite web|title=std::next_permutation|url=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=cppreference.com|date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Generation with minimal changes====\n{{main|Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm|Heap's algorithm}}\nAn alternative to the above algorithm, the [[Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm]], generates an ordering on all the permutations of a given sequence with the property that any two consecutive permutations in its output differ by swapping two adjacent values. This ordering on the permutations was known to 17th-century English bell ringers, among whom it was known as \"plain changes\". One advantage of this method is that the small amount of change from one permutation to the next allows the method to be implemented in constant time per permutation. The same can also easily generate the subset of even permutations, again in constant time per permutation, by skipping every other output permutation.{{sfn|Knuth|2005|pp=1\u201326}}\n\nAn alternative to Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter is [[Heap's algorithm]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heap|first=B.

Meandric permutations are useful in the analysis of RNA secondary structure. Not all alternate permutations are meandric.

The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.<ref>{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}</ref>\n\nPermutations differ from [[combination]]s, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order. For example, written as [[tuple]]s, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all the possible orderings of this three-element set. [[Anagram]]s of words whose letters are different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of [[finite set]]s is an important topic in the fields of [[combinatorics]] and [[group theory]].\n\nPermutations are used in almost every branch of mathematics, and in many other fields of science. In [[computer science]], they are used for analyzing [[sorting algorithm]]s; in [[quantum physics]], for describing states of particles; and in [[biology]], for describing [[RNA]] sequences. \n\n{{anchor|n-factorial}}The number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}&nbsp;[[factorial]], usually written as {{math|''n''!}}, which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to {{math|''n''}}.\n\nTechnically, a permutation of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''S''}} is defined as a [[bijection]] from {{math|''S''}} to itself.<ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=152}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|p=86}}</ref>  That is, it is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from {{math|''S''}} to {{math|''S''}} for which every element occurs exactly once as an [[image (mathematics)|image]] value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of {{math|''S''}} in which each element {{math|''s''}} is replaced by the corresponding {{math|''f''(''s'')}}. For example, the permutation (3,1,2) mentioned above is described by the function <math>\\alpha</math> defined as:\n\n: <math>\\alpha(1) = 3, \\quad \\alpha(2) = 1, \\quad \\alpha(3) = 2</math>.\n\nThe collection of all permutations of a set form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[symmetric group]] of the set. The group operation is the [[function composition|composition]] (performing two given rearrangements in succession), which results in another rearrangement. As properties of permutations do not depend on the nature of the set elements, it is often the permutations of the set <math>\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}</math> that are considered for studying permutations. \n\nIn elementary combinatorics, the {{math|''k''}}-permutations, or [[partial permutation]]s, are the ordered arrangements of {{math|''k''}} distinct elements selected from a set. When {{math|''k''}} is equal to the size of the set, these are the permutations of the set.\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|In the popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]], each turn of the puzzle faces creates a permutation of the surface colors.]]\n\n==History==\n[[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|Al-Khalil]] (717\u2013786), an [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematician]] and [[cryptographer]], wrote the ''Book of Cryptographic Messages''.

The ''[[Lilavati]]'' by the Indian mathematician [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara II]] contains a passage that translates to:\n<blockquote>\nThe product of multiplication of the arithmetical series beginning and increasing by unity and continued to the number of places, will be the variations of number with specific figures.<ref>{{cite journal |first=N.

Starting from two bells: \"first, ''two'' must be admitted to be varied in two ways\" which he illustrates by showing 1 2 and 2 1.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=4}}  He then explains that with three bells there are \"three times two figures to be produced out of three\" which again is illustrated.  His explanation involves \"cast away 3, and 1.2 will remain; cast away 2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and 2.3 will remain\".{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=5}}  He then moves on to four bells and repeats the casting away argument showing that there will be four different sets of three.  Effectively this is a recursive process.  He continues with five bells using the \"casting away\" method and tabulates the resulting 120 combinations.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=6\u20147}}  At this point he gives up and remarks:\n<blockquote>\nNow the nature of these methods is such, that the changes on one number comprehends the changes on all lesser numbers, ... insomuch that a compleat Peal of changes on one number seemeth to be formed by uniting of the compleat Peals on all lesser numbers into one entire body;{{sfn|Stedman|1677|p=8}}\n</blockquote>\nStedman widens the consideration of permutations; he goes on to consider the number of permutations of the letters of the alphabet and of horses from a stable of 20.{{sfn|Stedman|1677|pp=13\u201418}}\n\nA first case in which seemingly unrelated mathematical questions were studied with the help of permutations occurred around 1770, when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the [[Polynomial#Solving polynomial equations|roots]] of an equation are related to the possibilities to solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in [[Galois theory]], which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn mathematics texts it is customary to denote permutations using lowercase Greek letters. Commonly, either <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>, or <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> and <math>\\pi</math> are used.<ref name=\"Scheinerman\">{{cite book |last1=Scheinerman |first1=Edward A. |date=March 5, 2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Functions |title=Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |url-status=live |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=188 |isbn=0840049420 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205212843/https://books.google.com/books?id=DZBHGD2sEYwC&pg=PA188 |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2020 |quote=It is customary to use lowercase Greek letters (especially \u03c0, \u03c3, and \u03c4) to stand for permutations.}}</ref>\n\nPermutations can be defined as bijections from a set {{math|''S''}} onto itself. All permutations of a set with ''n'' elements form a [[symmetric group]], denoted <math>S_n</math>, where the [[group operation]] is [[Composition of functions|function composition]]. Thus for two permutations, <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> in the group <math>S_n</math>, the four group axioms hold: \n\n# [[Closure (mathematics)|Closure]]: If <math>\\pi</math> and <math>\\sigma</math> are in <math>S_n</math> then so is <math>\\pi\\sigma.</math> \n# [[Associativity]]: For any three permutations <math>\\pi, \\sigma, \\tau \\in S_n</math>, <math>(\\pi\\sigma)\\tau = \\pi(\\sigma\\tau).</math>\n# [[Identity element|Identity]]: There is an identity permutation, denoted <math>\\operatorname{id}</math> and defined by <math>\\operatorname{id}(x) = x</math> for all <math>x \\in S</math>.

The older and more elementary view holds that permutations are the rearrangements. Sometimes to distinguish these two views, the words ''active'' and ''passive'' forms, or in older terminology ''substitutions'' and ''permutations'' are used.{{sfn|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 29, footnote 3}}\n\nA permutation can be decomposed into one or more disjoint ''cycles'', that is, the [[Orbit (group theory)|orbits]], which are found by repeatedly tracing the application of the permutation on some elements. For example, the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> defined by <math>\\sigma(7) = 7</math> has a 1-cycle, <math>(\\,7\\,)</math> while the permutation <math>\\pi</math> defined by <math>\\pi(2) = 3</math> and <math>\\pi(3) = 2</math> has a 2-cycle <math>(\\,2\\,3\\,)</math> (for details on the syntax see the section [[#Cycle notation|Cycle notation]] below). In general, a cycle of length ''k'', that is, consisting of ''k'' elements, is called a ''k''-cycle.\n\nAn element in a 1-cycle <math>(\\,x\\,)</math> is called a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the permutation. A permutation with no fixed points is called a [[derangement]]. 2-cycles are called [[transposition (mathematics)|transpositions]]; such permutations merely exchange two elements, leaving the others fixed.\n\n==Notations==\n{{anchor|Two-line notation}} Since writing permutations elementwise, that is, as [[piecewise]] functions, is cumbersome, several notations have been invented to represent them more compactly. ''Cycle notation'' is a popular choice for many mathematicians due to its compactness and the fact that it makes a permutation's structure transparent. It is the notation used in this article unless otherwise specified, but other notations are still widely used, especially in application areas. \n\n===Two-line notation===\nIn [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s ''two-line notation'',<ref>{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation\u2014in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses\u2014for the first time in 1815.}}</ref> one lists the elements of ''S'' in the first row, and for each one its image below it in the second row. For instance, a particular permutation of the set ''S'' = {1,2,3,4,5} can be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n  2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix};</math>\nthis means that ''\u03c3'' satisfies {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(1) {{=}} 2}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(2) {{=}} 5}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(3) {{=}} 4}}, {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(4) {{=}} 3}}, and {{nowrap|''\u03c3''(5) {{=}} 1}}. The elements of ''S'' may appear in any order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n  4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\nor\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  5 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 \\\\\n  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n===One-line notation===\nIf there is a \"natural\" order for the elements of ''S'',{{efn|The order is often implicitly understood. A set of integers is naturally written from smallest to largest; a set of letters is written in lexicographic order. For other sets, a natural order needs to be specified explicitly.}} say <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n</math>, then one uses this for the first row of the two-line notation:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  x_1         & x_2         & x_3         & \\cdots & x_n \\\\\n  \\sigma(x_1) & \\sigma(x_2) & \\sigma(x_3) & \\cdots & \\sigma(x_n)\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nUnder this assumption, one may omit the first row and write the permutation in ''one-line notation'' as\n: <math>(\\sigma(x_1) \\; \\sigma(x_2) \\; \\sigma(x_3) \\; \\cdots \\; \\sigma(x_n) )</math>,\nthat is, an ordered arrangement of S.<ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gerstein|1987|p=217}}</ref> Care must be taken to distinguish one-line notation from the [[#Cycle notation|cycle notation]] described below. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the ''[[Word (mathematics)|word]] representation'' of a permutation.<ref name=\"Aigner2007\"/> The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for the first row. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary [[combinatorics]] and [[computer science]]. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of ''S'' or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.\n\n===Cycle notation===\nCycle notation describes the effect of repeatedly applying the permutation on the elements of the set. It expresses the permutation as a product of [[cyclic permutation|cycles]]; since distinct cycles are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], this is referred to as \"decomposition into disjoint cycles\".{{efn|Due to the likely possibility of confusion, cycle notation is not used in conjunction with one-line notation (sequences) for permutations.}}\n\nTo write down the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> in cycle notation, one proceeds as follows:\n\n# Write an opening bracket then select an arbitrary element ''x'' of <math>S</math> and write it down: <math>(\\,x</math>\n# Then trace the orbit of ''x''; that is, write down its values under successive applications of <math>\\sigma</math>: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots</math>\n# Repeat until the value returns to ''x'' and write down a closing parenthesis rather than ''x'': <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Now continue with an element ''y'' of ''S'', not yet written down, and proceed in the same way: <math>(\\,x\\,\\sigma(x)\\,\\sigma(\\sigma(x))\\,\\ldots\\,)(\\,y\\,\\ldots\\,)</math>\n# Repeat until all elements of ''S'' are written in cycles.\n\nSince for every new cycle the starting point can be chosen in different ways, there are in general many different cycle notations for the same permutation; for the example above one has:\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}5 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n1-cycles are often omitted from the cycle notation, provided that the context is clear; for any element ''x'' in ''S'' not appearing in any cycle, one implicitly assumes <math>\\sigma(x) = x</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=54}}</ref> The [[identity permutation]], which consists only of 1-cycles, can be denoted by a single 1-cycle (x), by the number 1,{{efn|1 is frequently used to represent the [[identity element]] in a non-commutative group}} or by ''id''.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2002|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bogart|1990|p=487}}</ref>\n\nA convenient feature of cycle notation is that one can find a permutation's inverse simply by reversing the order of the elements in the permutation's cycles.

These are not permutations except in special cases, but are natural generalizations of the ordered arrangement concept. Indeed, this use often involves considering arrangements of a fixed length&nbsp;''k'' of elements taken from a given set of size ''n'', in other words, these '''''k''-permutations of ''n''''' are the different ordered arrangements of a ''k''-element subset of an ''n''-set (sometimes called '''variations''' in the older literature.{{efn|More precisely, ''variations without repetition''. The term is still common in other languages and appears in modern English most often in translation.}}) These objects are also known as '''[[Partial permutation#Restricted partial permutations|partial permutations]]''' or as '''sequences without repetition''', terms that avoid confusion with the other, more common, meaning of \"permutation\". The number of such <math>k</math>-permutations of <math>n</math> is denoted variously by such symbols as <math>P^n_k</math>,  <math>_nP_k</math>, <math>^nP_k</math>, <math>P_{n,k}</math>, or <math>P(n,k)</math>, and its value is given by the product<ref>{{cite book|author=Charalambides, Ch A.|title=Enumerative Combinatorics|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58488-290-9|page=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDMGA-v5G54C&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\n: <math>P(n,k) = \\underbrace{n\\cdot(n-1)\\cdot(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}_{k\\ \\mathrm{factors}}</math>,\nwhich is 0 when {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}, and otherwise is equal to\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\n\nThe product is well defined without the assumption that <math>n</math> is a non-negative integer and is of importance outside combinatorics as well; it is known as the [[Pochhammer symbol]] <math>(n)_k</math> or as the <math>k</math>-th falling factorial power <math>n^{\\underline k}</math> of <math>n</math>.\n\nThis usage of the term ''permutation'' is closely related to the term ''[[combination]]''. A ''k''-element combination of an ''n''-set ''S'' is a ''k'' element subset of ''S'', the elements of which are not ordered. By taking all the ''k'' element subsets of ''S'' and ordering each of them in all possible ways we obtain all the ''k''-permutations of ''S''. The number of ''k''-combinations of an ''n''-set, ''C''(''n'',''k''), is therefore related to the number of ''k''-permutations of ''n'' by:\n: <math>C(n,k) = \\frac{P(n,k)}{P(k,k)} = \\frac{\\tfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}}{\\tfrac{k!}{0!}} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\\,k!}.</math>\n\nThese numbers are also known as [[binomial coefficient]]s and are denoted by <math>\\binom{n}{k}</math>.\n<!--\n\n--- Duplicate of above ... hold for possible inclusion\n\n===Counting sequences without repetition===\nIn this section, a ''k''-permutation of a set ''S'' is an ordered sequence of ''k'' distinct elements of ''S''. For example, given the set of letters {<tt>C</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, <tt>I</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>R</tt>}, the sequence <tt>ICE</tt> is a 3-permutation, <tt>RING</tt> and  <tt>RICE</tt> are 4-permutations, <tt>NICER</tt> and <tt>REIGN</tt> are 5-permutations, and <tt>CRINGE</tt> is a 6-permutation; since the latter uses all letters, it is a permutation of the given set in the ordinary combinatorial sense. <tt>ENGINE</tt> on the other hand is not a permutation, because of the repetitions: it uses the elements <tt>E</tt> and <tt>N</tt> twice.\n\nLet ''n'' be the size of ''S'', the number of elements available for selection. In constructing a ''k''-permutation, there are ''n''&nbsp; possible choices for the first element of the sequence, and this is then number of 1-permutations. Once it has been chosen, there are {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} elements of ''S'' left to choose from, so a second element can be chosen in {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} ways, giving a total ''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) possible 2-permutations. For each successive element of the sequence, the number of possibilities decreases by 1&nbsp; which leads to the number of\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2)  ... \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 ''k'' + 1) possible ''k''-permutations.\nThis gives in particular the number of ''n''-permutations (which contain all elements of ''S'' once, and are therefore simply permutations of ''S''):\n:''n'' \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 2) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1,\na number that occurs so frequently in mathematics that it is given a compact notation \"''n''!\", and is called \"''n'' [[factorial]]\". These ''n''-permutations are the longest sequences without repetition of elements of ''S'', which is reflected by the fact that the above formula for the number of ''k''-permutations gives zero whenever ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n''.\n\nThe number of ''k''-permutations of a set of ''n'' elements is sometimes denoted by ''P''(''n'',''k'') or a similar notation (usually accompanied by a notation for the number of ''k''-[[combination]]s of a set of ''n'' elements in which the \"''P''\" is replaced by \"''C''\"). That notation is rarely used in other contexts than that of counting ''k''-permutations, but the expression for the number does arise in many other situations. Being a product of ''k'' factors starting at ''n'' and decreasing by unit steps, it is called the ''k''-th falling factorial power of ''n'':\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times\\cdots\\times(n-k+1),</math>\nthough many other names and notations are in use, as detailed at [[Pochhammer symbol]]. When ''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n'' the factorial power can be completed by additional factors: ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''k'')!&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''!, which allows writing\n:<math>n^{\\underline k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.</math>\nThe right hand side is often given as expression for the number of ''k''-permutations, but its main merit is using the compact factorial notation. Expressing a product of ''k'' factors as a quotient of potentially much larger products, where all factors in the denominator are also explicitly present in the numerator, is not particularly efficient; as a method of computation there is the additional danger of overflow or rounding errors. It should also be noted that the expression is undefined when ''k''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''n'', whereas in those cases the number ''n''<sup><u>''k''</u></sup> of ''k''-permutations is just&nbsp;0.\n-->\n\n===Permutations with repetition===\nOrdered arrangements of the elements of a set ''S'' of length ''n'' where repetition is allowed are called [[Tuple|''n''-tuples]], but have sometimes been referred to as '''permutations with repetition''' although they are not permutations in general. They are also called [[word (mathematics)|words]] over the alphabet ''S'' in some contexts. If the set ''S'' has ''k'' elements, the number of ''n''-tuples over ''S'' is:\n:<math>k^n.</math>\nThere is no restriction on how often an element can appear in an ''n''-tuple, but if restrictions are placed on how often an element can appear, this formula is no longer valid.\n\n===Permutations of multisets===\n[[File:Permutations with repetition.svg|thumb|Permutations of multisets]]\n\nIf ''M'' is a finite [[multiset]], then a '''multiset permutation''' is an ordered arrangement of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears exactly as often as is its multiplicity in ''M''. An [[anagram]] of a word having some repeated letters is an example of a multiset permutation.{{efn|The natural order in this example is the order of the letters in the original word.}} If the multiplicities of the elements of ''M'' (taken in some order) are <math>m_1</math>, <math>m_2</math>, ..., <math>m_l</math> and their sum (i.e., the size of ''M'') is ''n'', then the number of multiset permutations of ''M'' is given by the [[Multinomial coefficient#Multinomial coefficients|multinomial coefficient]],<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|loc=p. 46, Theorem 2.4.2}}</ref>\n:<math>{n \\choose m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_l} = \\frac{n!}{m_1!\\, m_2!\\, \\cdots\\, m_l!}= \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^l{m_i})!}\n{\\prod_{i=1}^l{m_i!} }.</math>\n\nFor example, the number of distinct anagrams of the word MISSISSIPPI is:<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=47}}</ref>\n:<math>\\frac{11!}{1!\\, 4!\\, 4!\\, 2!} = 34650</math>.\n\nA '''k-permutation''' of a multiset ''M'' is a sequence of length ''k'' of elements of ''M'' in which each element appears ''at most'' its multiplicity in ''M'' times (an element's ''repetition number'').\n\n===Circular permutations===\nPermutations, when considered as arrangements, are sometimes referred to as ''linearly ordered'' arrangements. In these arrangements there is a first element, a second element, and so on. If, however, the objects are arranged in a circular manner this distinguished ordering no longer exists, that is, there is no \"first element\" in the arrangement, any element can be considered as the start of the arrangement. The arrangements of objects in a circular manner are called '''circular permutations'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|p=39}}</ref>{{efn|In older texts ''circular permutation'' was sometimes used as a synonym for [[cyclic permutation]], but this is no longer done. See {{harvtxt|Carmichael|1956|p=7}}}} These can be formally defined as [[equivalence classes]] of ordinary permutations of the objects, for the [[equivalence relation]] generated by moving the final element of the linear arrangement to its front.\n\nTwo circular permutations are equivalent if one can be rotated into the other (that is, cycled without changing the relative positions of the elements). The following two circular permutations on four letters are considered to be the same.\n\n<pre>\n     1           4\n   4   3       2   1\n     2           3</pre>\n\nThe circular arrangements are to be read counterclockwise, so the following two are not equivalent since no rotation can bring one to the other.\n<pre>\n     1          1\n   4   3      3   4\n     2          2</pre>\n\nThe number of circular permutations of a set ''S'' with ''n'' elements is (''n''&thinsp;\u2013&thinsp;1)!.\n\n==Properties==\nThe number of permutations of {{math|''n''}} distinct objects is {{math|''n''}}!.\n\nThe number of {{math|''n''}}-permutations with {{math|''k''}} disjoint cycles is the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], denoted by {{math|''c''(''n'', ''k'')}}.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=97\u2013103}}\n\n===Permutation type===\nThe cycles of a permutation partition the set <math>S_n</math> so the lengths of the cycles of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> forms a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of ''n'' called the [[cycle type]] of <math>\\sigma</math>. There is a \"1\" in the cycle type for every fixed point of \u03c3, a \"2\" for every transposition, and so on. The cycle type of <math>\\beta = (\\,1\\,2\\,5\\,)(\\,3\\,4\\,)(6\\,8\\,)(\\,7\\,)</math> is (3,2,2,1) which is sometimes written in a more compact form as [1<sup>1</sup>2<sup>2</sup>3<sup>1</sup>]. <!-- Biggs notation -->\n\nThe general form is <math>[1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}]</math>, where <math>\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_n</math> are the number of cycles of respective length. The number of partitions of a certain type is then given by:\n: <math>\\frac{n!}{1^{\\alpha_1}2^{\\alpha_2}\\dotsm n^{\\alpha_n}\\alpha_1!\\alpha_2!\\dotsm \\alpha_n!}</math>.\n\n===Conjugating permutations===\nIn general, composing permutations written in cycle notation follows no easily described pattern \u2013 the cycles of the composition can be different from those being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of [[conjugacy class|conjugating]] a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> by another permutation <math>\\pi</math>, which means forming the product <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math>. Here, <math>\\pi\\sigma\\pi^{-1}</math> is the ''conjugate'' of <math>\\sigma</math> and its cycle notation can be obtained by taking the cycle notation for ''\u03c3'' and applying ''\u03c0'' to all the entries in it.{{sfn|Humphreys|1996|p=84}} It follows that two permutations are conjugate exactly when they have the same type.\n\n===Permutation order===\nThe order of a permutation <math>\\sigma</math> is the smallest positive integer ''m'' so that <math>\\sigma^m = \\mathrm{id}</math>. It is the [[least common multiple]] of its cycles lengths. For example, the order of <math>(\\,1\\,3\\,2)(\\,4\\,5\\,)</math> is <math>2\\cdot3 = 6</math>.\n\n===Parity of a permutation===\nEvery permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of transpositions.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1959|p=60}}</ref>\nAlthough many such expressions for a given permutation may exist, either they all contain an even or an odd number of transpositions. Thus all permutations can be classified as [[Even and odd permutations|even or odd]] depending on this number.\n\nThis result can be extended so as to assign a ''sign'', written <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma</math>, to each permutation. <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = +1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is even and <math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma = -1</math> if <math>\\sigma</math> is odd. Then for two permutations <math>\\sigma</math> and <math>\\pi</math>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\pi) = \\operatorname{sgn}\\sigma\\cdot\\operatorname{sgn}\\pi.</math>\n\nIt follows that <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma\\sigma^{-1}) = +1.</math>\n\n===Matrix representation===\n[[File:Symmetric group 3; Cayley table; matrices.svg|thumb|Composition of permutations corresponds to multiplication of permutation matrices.]]\nOne can represent a permutation of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} as an ''n''\u00d7''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. There are two natural ways to do so, but only one for which multiplications of matrices corresponds to multiplication of permutations in the same order: this is the one that associates to ''\u03c3'' the matrix ''M'' whose entry ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is 1 if ''i'' = ''\u03c3''(''j''), and 0 otherwise. The resulting matrix has exactly one entry 1 in each column and in each row, and is called a ''[[permutation matrix]]''. <br />\n[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg/1000px-Symmetric_group_4%3B_permutation_list_with_matrices.svg.png Here] <small>([[:File:Symmetric group 4; permutation list with matrices.svg|file]])</small> is a list of these matrices for permutations of 4 elements. The [[Cayley table]] on the right shows these matrices for permutations of 3 elements.\n\n=== Foata's transition lemma ===\nThere is a relationship between the one-line and the canonical cycle notation. Consider the permutation <math>(\\,2\\,)(\\,3\\,1\\,)</math>, in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain the permutation <math>(2, 3, 1)</math> in one-line notation. [[Dominique Foata|Foata]]'s transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of ''n''-permutations (to itself).{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the ''fundamental bijection''.<ref name=\"Stanley2012\"/> \n\nLet <math>f</math> be the parentheses-erasing transformation. The inverse of <math>q = f(p)</math> is a bit less intuitive. Starting with the one-line notation <math>q = q_1q_2\\cdots q_n</math>, the first cycle in canonical cycle notation must start with <math>q_1</math>. As long as the subsequent elements are smaller than <math>q_1</math>, we are in the same cycle. The second cycle starts at the smallest index <math>j</math> such that <math>q_j > q_1</math>. In other words, <math>q_j</math> is larger than everything else to its left, so it is called a ''left-to-right maximum''. Every cycle in the canonical cycle notation starts with a left-to-right maximum.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\nFor example, in the one-line notation <math>(3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9, 7, 6)</math>, 5 is the first element larger than 3, so the first cycle must be <math>(\\,3\\,1\\,2\\,)</math>. Then 8 is the next element larger than 5, so the second cycle is <math>(\\,5\\,4\\,)</math>. Since 9 is larger than 8, <math>(\\,8\\,)</math> is a cycle by itself. Finally, 9 is larger than all the remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is <math>(\\,9\\,7\\,6\\,)</math>.\n\nAs a first corollary, the number of n-permutations with exactly ''k'' left-to-right maxima is also equal to the signless [[Stirling number of the first kind]], <math>c(n, k)</math>. Furthermore, Foata's mapping takes an ''n''-permutation with ''k''-weak excedances to an ''n''-permutations with {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} ascents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pp=109\u2013110}}  For example, (2)(31) = 321 has two weak excedances (at index 1 and 2), whereas {{nowrap|''f''(321) {{=}} 231}} has one ascent (at index 1; i.e., from 2 to 3).\n\n==Permutations of totally ordered sets==\nIn some applications, the elements of the set being permuted will be compared with each other. This requires that the set ''S'' has a [[total order]] so that any two elements can be compared. The set {1, 2, ..., ''n''} is totally ordered by the usual \"\u2264\" relation and so it is the most frequently used set in these applications, but in general, any totally ordered set will do. In these applications, the ordered arrangement view of a permutation is needed to talk about the ''positions'' in a permutation.\n\nThere are a number of properties that are directly related to the total ordering of ''S''.\n\n===Ascents, descents, runs and excedances===\nAn ''ascent'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' of ''n'' is any position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' where the following value is bigger than the current one. That is, if  ''\u03c3''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub>...''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub>, then ''i'' is an ascent if ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''i''+1</sub>.\n\nFor example, the permutation 3452167 has ascents (at positions) 1, 2, 5, and 6.\n\nSimilarly, a ''descent'' is a position ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' with ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, so every ''i'' with <math>1 \\leq i<n</math> either is an ascent or  is a descent of&nbsp;''\u03c3''.\n\nAn ''ascending run'' of a permutation is a nonempty increasing contiguous subsequence of the permutation that cannot be extended at either end; it corresponds to a maximal sequence of successive ascents (the latter may be empty: between two successive descents there is still an ascending run of length&nbsp;1). By contrast an ''increasing subsequence'' of a permutation is not necessarily contiguous: it is an increasing sequence of elements obtained from the permutation by omitting the values at some positions.\nFor example, the permutation 2453167 has the ascending runs 245, 3, and 167, while it has an increasing subsequence 2367.\n\nIf a permutation has ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 descents, then it must be the union of ''k'' ascending runs.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=4f}}\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' ascents is (by definition) the [[Eulerian number]] <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math>; this is also the number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' descents. Some authors however define the Eulerian number <math>\\textstyle\\left\\langle{n\\atop k}\\right\\rangle</math> as the number of permutations with ''k'' ascending runs, which corresponds to {{nowrap|''k'' \u2212 1}} descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|pages=4\u20135}}\n\nAn excedance of a permutation ''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub>...''\u03c3''<sub>''n''</sub> in an index ''j'' such that {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> > ''j''}}. If the inequality is not strict (i.e., {{nowrap|''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2265 ''j''}}), then ''j'' is called a ''weak excedance''. The number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' excedances coincides with the number of ''n''-permutations with ''k'' descents.{{sfn|Bona|2012|page=25}}\n\n===Inversions===\n{{main|Inversion (discrete mathematics)}}\n[[Image:15-Puzzle.jpg|thumb|In the [[15 puzzle]] the goal is to get the squares in ascending order.  Initial positions which have an odd number of inversions are impossible to solve.<ref name=\"Slocum\">{{cite web\n  | last1     = Slocum\n  | first1    = Jerry\n  | last2     = Weisstein\n  | first2    = Eric W.\n  | title = 15 \u2013 puzzle\n  | work = MathWorld\n  | publisher = Wolfram Research, Inc.\n  | date = 1999\n  | url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/15Puzzle.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = October 4, 2014\n}}</ref>]]\n\nAn ''[[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]'' of a permutation&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is a pair {{nowrap|(''i'',''j'')}} of positions where the entries of a permutation are in the opposite order: {{nowrap|''i'' < ''j''}} and {{nowrap|''\u03c3_i'' > ''\u03c3_j''}}.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|p=43}}  So a descent is just an inversion at two adjacent positions. For example, the permutation {{nowrap|''\u03c3'' {{=}} 23154}} has three inversions: (1,3), (2,3), (4,5), for the pairs of entries (2,1), (3,1), (5,4).\n\nSometimes an inversion is defined as the pair of values {{nowrap|(''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>,''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>)}} itself whose order is reversed; this makes no difference for the ''number'' of inversions, and this pair (reversed) is also an inversion in the above sense for the inverse permutation ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. The number of inversions is an important measure for the degree to which the entries of a permutation are out of order; it is the same for ''\u03c3'' and for ''\u03c3''<sup>\u22121</sup>. To bring a permutation with ''k'' inversions into order (i.e., transform it into the identity permutation), by successively applying (right-multiplication by) [[adjacent transposition]]s, is always possible and requires a sequence of ''k'' such operations. Moreover, any reasonable choice for the adjacent transpositions will work: it suffices to choose at each step a transposition of ''i'' and {{nowrap|''i'' + 1}} where ''i'' is a descent of the permutation as modified so far (so that the transposition will remove this particular descent, although it might create other descents). This is so because applying such a transposition reduces the number of inversions by&nbsp;1; as long as this number is not zero, the permutation is not the identity, so it has at least one descent. [[Bubble sort]] and [[insertion sort]] can be interpreted as particular instances of this procedure to put a sequence into order. Incidentally this procedure proves that any permutation ''\u03c3'' can be written as a product of adjacent transpositions; for this one may simply reverse any sequence of such transpositions that transforms ''\u03c3'' into the identity. In fact, by enumerating all sequences of adjacent transpositions that would transform ''\u03c3'' into the identity, one obtains (after reversal) a ''complete'' list of all expressions of minimal length writing ''\u03c3'' as a product of adjacent transpositions.\n\nThe number of permutations of ''n'' with ''k'' inversions is expressed by a Mahonian number,{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2004|pp=43ff}} it is the coefficient of ''X''<sup>''k''</sup> in the expansion of the product\n:<math>\\prod_{m=1}^n\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}X^i = 1 \\left(1 + X\\right)\\left(1 + X + X^2\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 + X + X^2 + \\cdots + X^{n-1}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is also known (with ''q'' substituted for ''X'') as the [[q-factorial]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>''n''<nowiki>]</nowiki><sub>''q''</sub>!&nbsp;. The expansion of the product appears in [[Necklace (combinatorics)]].\n\n==Permutations in computing==\n===Numbering permutations===\nOne way to represent permutations of ''n'' is by an integer ''N'' with 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n''!, provided convenient methods are given to convert between the number and the representation of a permutation as an ordered arrangement (sequence). This gives the most compact representation of arbitrary permutations, and in computing is particularly attractive when ''n'' is small enough that ''N'' can be held in a machine word; for 32-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;12, and for 64-bit words this means ''n''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;20. The conversion can be done via the intermediate form of a sequence of numbers ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>, where ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> is a non-negative integer less than ''i'' (one may omit ''d''<sub>1</sub>, as it is always 0, but its presence makes the subsequent conversion to a permutation easier to describe). The first step then is to simply express ''N'' in the ''[[factorial number system]]'', which is just a particular [[mixed radix]] representation, where for numbers up to ''n''! the bases for successive digits are ''n'', {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}}, ..., 2, 1. The second step interprets this sequence as a [[Lehmer code]] or (almost equivalently) as an inversion table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin: 1em\"\n|+ Rothe diagram for <math>\\sigma = (6, 3, 8, 1, 4, 9, 7, 2, 5)</math>\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|<sub>''i''</sub>| <sup>''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>}}\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 1\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 2\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 3\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 4\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 5\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 6\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 7\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 8\n! style=\"width:20pt;\"| 9\n!

More precisely, each ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> gives the number of ''remaining'' elements strictly less than the term ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. Since those remaining elements are bound to turn up as some later term ''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>, the digit ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> counts the ''inversions'' (''i'',''j'') involving ''i'' as smaller index (the number of values ''j'' for which ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''j'' and ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>). The '''inversion table''' for&nbsp;''\u03c3'' is quite similar, but here ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''k''</sub> counts the number of inversions (''i'',''j'') where ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub> occurs as the smaller of the two values appearing in inverted order.{{sfn|Knuth|1973|p=12}}  Both encodings can be visualized by an ''n''&nbsp;by&nbsp;''n'' '''Rothe diagram'''{{#tag:ref|[[Heinrich August Rothe|H. A. Rothe]], ''Sammlung combinatorisch-analytischer Abhandlungen'' '''2''' (Leipzig, 1800), 263\u2013305. Cited in {{harvnb|Knuth|1973|p=14}}}} (named after [[Heinrich August Rothe]]) in which dots at (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>) mark the entries of the permutation, and a cross at (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>) marks the inversion (''i'',''j''); by the definition of inversions a cross appears in any square that comes both before the dot (''j'',''\u03c3''<sub>''j''</sub>) in its column, and before the dot (''i'',''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>) in its row. The Lehmer code lists the numbers of crosses in successive rows, while the inversion table lists the numbers of crosses in successive columns; it is just the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation, and vice versa.\n\nTo effectively convert a Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into a permutation of an ordered set ''S'', one can start with a list of the elements of ''S'' in increasing order, and for ''i'' increasing from 1 to ''n'' set ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub> to the element in the list that is preceded by ''d''<sub>''n''+1\u2212''i''</sub> other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from ''d''<sub>1</sub> to ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> while inserting the elements of ''S'' from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number ''d'' from the inversion table, the element from ''S'' inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by ''d'' elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of ''S'' both in the opposite order, starting with a row of ''n'' empty slots, and at each step place the element from ''S'' into the empty slot that is preceded by ''d'' other empty slots.\n\nConverting successive natural numbers to the factorial number system produces those sequences in [[lexicographic order]] (as is the case with any mixed radix number system), and further converting them to permutations preserves the lexicographic ordering, provided the Lehmer code interpretation is used (using inversion tables, one gets a different ordering, where one starts by comparing permutations by the ''place'' of their entries 1 rather than by the value of their first entries). The sum of the numbers in the factorial number system representation gives the number of inversions of the permutation, and the parity of that sum gives the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of the permutation. Moreover, the positions of the zeroes in the inversion table give the values of left-to-right maxima of the permutation (in the example 6, 8, 9) while the positions of the zeroes in the Lehmer code are the positions of the right-to-left minima (in the example positions the 4, 8, 9 of the values 1, 2, 5); this allows computing the distribution of such extrema among all permutations. A permutation with Lehmer code ''d''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>, ..., ''d''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub> has an ascent {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 ''i''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''d''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 ''d''<sub>''i+1''</sub>}}.\n\n===Algorithms to generate permutations===\nIn computing it may be required to generate permutations of a given sequence of values. The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another question is whether possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence.\n\nAn obvious way to generate permutations of ''n'' is to generate values for the Lehmer code (possibly using the [[factorial number system]] representation of integers up to ''n''!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires ''n'' operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an [[array data structure|array]] or a [[linked list]], both require (for different reasons) about ''n''<sup>2</sup>/4 operations to perform the conversion. With ''n'' likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not too much of a problem, but it turns out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in [[big O notation|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')]] time.\n\n====Random generation of permutations====\n{{Main|Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle}}\nFor generating [[random permutation]]s of a given sequence of ''n'' values, it makes no difference whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of ''n'' to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of ''n'' that result in the same permuted sequence, the number of such permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large ''n'' due to the growth of the number ''n''!, there is no reason to assume that ''n'' will be small for random generation.\n\nThe basic idea to generate a random permutation is to generate at random one of the ''n''! sequences of integers ''d''<sub>1</sub>,''d''<sub>2</sub>,...,''d''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfying {{math|0 \u2264 ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> &lt; ''i''}} (since ''d''<sub>1</sub> is always zero it may be omitted) and to convert it to a permutation through a [[bijective]] correspondence. For the latter correspondence one could interpret the (reverse) sequence as a Lehmer code, and this gives a generation method first published in 1938 by [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Frank Yates]].<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Fisher, R.A. |author2=Yates, F. | title = Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research\n| origyear = 1938\n| edition = 3rd\n| year = 1948\n| pages = 26\u201327\n| publisher = Oliver & Boyd\n| location = London\n| oclc = 14222135\n}}</ref>\nWhile at the time computer implementation was not an issue, this method suffers from the difficulty sketched above to convert from Lehmer code to permutation efficiently. This can be remedied by using a different bijective correspondence: after using ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> to select an element among ''i'' remaining elements of the sequence (for decreasing values of ''i''), rather than removing the element and compacting the sequence by shifting down further elements one place, one [[swap (computer science)|swaps]] the element with the final remaining element. Thus the elements remaining for selection form a consecutive range at each point in time, even though they may not occur in the same order as they did in the original sequence. The mapping from sequence of integers to permutations is somewhat complicated, but it can be seen to produce each permutation in exactly one way, by an immediate [[induction (mathematics)|induction]]. When the selected element happens to be the final remaining element, the swap operation can be omitted. This does not occur sufficiently often to warrant testing for the condition, but the final element must be included among the candidates of the selection, to guarantee that all permutations can be generated.\n\nThe resulting algorithm for generating a random permutation of <code>''a''[0], ''a''[1], ..., ''a''[''n'' \u2212 1]</code> can be described as follows in [[pseudocode]]:\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' ''n'' '''downto''' 2 '''do'''\n     ''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' \u2212 1 }\n     '''swap''' ''a''[''d<sub>i</sub>''] and ''a''[''i'' \u2212 1]\n\nThis can be combined with the initialization of the array <code>''a''[''i''] = ''i''</code> as follows\n\n '''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 0 '''to''' ''n''\u22121 '''do'''\n     ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> \u2190 random element of { 0, ..., ''i'' }\n     ''a''[''i''] \u2190 ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>]\n     ''a''[''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub>] \u2190 ''i''\n\nIf ''d''<sub>''i''+1</sub> = ''i'', the first assignment will copy an uninitialized value, but the second will overwrite it with the correct value ''i''.\n\nHowever, Fisher-Yates is not the fastest algorithm for generating a permutation, because Fisher-Yates is essentially a sequential algorithm and \"divide and conquer\" procedures can achieve the same result in parallel.<ref>{{cite article|author1=Bacher, A. |author2=Bodini, O.|author3=Hwang, H.K.|author4=Tsai, T.H. | title = Generating Random Permutations by Coin Tossing: Classical Algorithms, New Analysis, and Modern Implementation.\n| edition = ACM Trans.

It can handle repeated values, for which case it generates each distinct multiset permutation once. Even for ordinary permutations it is significantly more efficient than generating values for the Lehmer code in lexicographic order (possibly using the [[factorial number system]]) and converting those to permutations. It begins by sorting the sequence in (weakly) [[increasing]] order (which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation), and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as long as one is found. The method goes back to [[Narayana Pandit]]a in 14th century India, and has been rediscovered frequently.{{sfn|Knuth|2005|pp=1\u201326}}\n\nThe following algorithm generates the next permutation lexicographically after a given permutation. It changes the given permutation in-place.\n\n# Find the largest index ''k'' such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1]}}.  If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation.\n# Find the largest index ''l'' greater than k such that {{nowrap|''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l'']}}.\n# Swap the value of ''a''[''k''] with that of ''a''[''l''].\n# Reverse the sequence from ''a''[''k'' + 1] up to and including the final element ''a''[''n''].\nFor example, given the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4] (which is in increasing order), and given that the index is [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based]], the steps are as follows:\n# Index ''k'' = 2, because 3 is placed at an index that satisfies condition of being the largest index that is still less than ''a''[''k'' + 1] which is 4.\n# Index ''l'' = 3, because 4 is the only value in the sequence that is greater than 3 in order to satisfy the condition ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''l''].\n# The values of ''a''[2] and ''a''[3] are swapped to form the new sequence [1,2,4,3].\n# The sequence after ''k''-index ''a''[2] to the final element is reversed. Because only one value lies after this index (the 3), the sequence remains unchanged in this instance. Thus the lexicographic successor of the initial state is permuted: [1,2,4,3].\nFollowing this algorithm, the next lexicographic permutation will be [1,3,2,4], and the 24th permutation will be [4,3,2,1] at which point ''a''[''k''] < ''a''[''k'' + 1] does not exist, indicating that this is the last permutation.\n\nThis method uses about 3 comparisons and 1.5 swaps per permutation, amortized over the whole sequence, not counting the initial sort.<ref>{{cite web|title=std::next_permutation|url=http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=cppreference.com|date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Generation with minimal changes====\n{{main|Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm|Heap's algorithm}}\nAn alternative to the above algorithm, the [[Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter algorithm]], generates an ordering on all the permutations of a given sequence with the property that any two consecutive permutations in its output differ by swapping two adjacent values. This ordering on the permutations was known to 17th-century English bell ringers, among whom it was known as \"plain changes\". One advantage of this method is that the small amount of change from one permutation to the next allows the method to be implemented in constant time per permutation. The same can also easily generate the subset of even permutations, again in constant time per permutation, by skipping every other output permutation.{{sfn|Knuth|2005|pp=1\u201326}}\n\nAn alternative to Steinhaus\u2013Johnson\u2013Trotter is [[Heap's algorithm]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heap|first=B.

Meandric permutations are useful in the analysis of RNA secondary structure. Not all alternate permutations are meandric. A modification of Heap's algorithm has been used to generate all alternate permutations of order ''n'' (that is, of length 2''n'') without generating all (2''n'')! permutations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1=Alexiou | first1=A.\n | last2=Psiha | first2=M.\n | last3=Vlamos | first3=P.\n | title= Combinatorial permutation based algorithm for representation of closed RNA secondary structures\n | journal=Bioinformation | year=2011 | volume=7 | issue = 2\n | pages=91\u201395\n | pmc=3174042 | doi=10.6026/97320630007091 | pmid=21938211\n}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|reason=Bioinformation is on Beall's list of questionable journals; it may provide only token peer-review|date=September 2016}} Generation of these alternate permutations is needed before they are analyzed to determine if they are meandric or not.\n\nThe algorithm is recursive. The following table exhibits a step in the procedure. In the previous step, all alternate permutations of length 5 have been generated. Three copies of each of these have a \"6\" added to the right end, and then a different transposition involving this last entry and a previous entry in an even position is applied (including the identity; i.e., no transposition).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The football team currently competes in the [[Ballarat Football League]], having debuted there in 1978.\n\n==History==\nThe club was originally founded in 1893, and completed in the Ballarat Football Association wearing the colours of red and white before changing to blue and white in 1894. The club was a founding member of the competition in 1893 finishing in fourth place, and took until 1920 to win its inaugural premiership. In 1922 the club adopted the colours of blue and gold that prevail to the present day.\n\nAfter winning its second premiership in 1929, Sebastopol moved to the Ballarat and District Football League and won two premierships in a row in 1936 and 1937 before joining the [[Ballarat Football League]] in 1938. The club played off in the grand final in its first season and were defeated by South Ballarat, but then in 1939 it transferred to the Clunes Football Association winning the premiership before returning to the BFL in 1940. Consequent to this World War Two affected player numbers causing Sebastopol to form a temporary merger with South Ballarat before the BFL went into recess.\n\nSebastopol returned in its pre war form in 1946 rejoining the Clunes FA. In 1947 it moved back to the BFL in its B Grade competition, and won premierships from 1950 to 1953. In 1959 the B Grade competition separated from the BFL to form the Ballarat District Football League and Sebastopol won premierships in this competition in 1965, 1967 and 1969.

The football team currently competes in the [[Ballarat Football League]], having debuted there in 1978. Sebastopol was runners-up in 2000.\n\n==History==\nThe club was originally founded in 1893, and completed in the Ballarat Football Association wearing the colours of red and white before changing to blue and white in 1894. The club was a founding member of the competition in 1893 finishing in fourth place, and took until 1920 to win its inaugural premiership. In 1922 the club adopted the colours of blue and gold that prevail to the present day.\n\nAfter winning its second premiership in 1929, Sebastopol moved to the Ballarat and District Football League and won two premierships in a row in 1936 and 1937 before joining the [[Ballarat Football League]] in 1938. The club played off in the grand final in its first season and were defeated by South Ballarat, but then in 1939 it transferred to the Clunes Football Association winning the premiership before returning to the BFL in 1940. Consequent to this World War Two affected player numbers causing Sebastopol to form a temporary merger with South Ballarat before the BFL went into recess.\n\nSebastopol returned in its pre war form in 1946 rejoining the Clunes FA. In 1947 it moved back to the BFL in its B Grade competition, and won premierships from 1950 to 1953. In 1959 the B Grade competition separated from the BFL to form the Ballarat District Football League and Sebastopol won premierships in this competition in 1965, 1967 and 1969. The BDFL then merged in 1973 with the Bacchus Marsh Football League and Sebastopol won the premiership in this competition in 1975. This would be the club's last premiership to date.\n\nSebastopol rejoined the BFL in 1978 and has made three grand finals, losing them to North Ballarat in 1985, Melton in 2000 and East Point in 2019.<ref>[http://www.sebasfnc.com.au/history/club-history Club history] on Sebastopol website</ref>\n\n==Home Ground==\n[[File:Marty Busch Reserve.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marty Busch Reserve - Opening of redeveloped ground, 2017]]\nSebastopol play their home matches at Marty Busch Reserve, Sebastopol.\n\n==VFL/AFL players==\n* [[Mick McGuane]] - {{AFL Col}} and {{AFL Car}}\n* [[Steven Venner]] - {{AFL NM}}\n* [[Rowan Marshall]]- {{AFL STK}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''History of Football in the Ballarat District''  by John Stoward - {{ISBN|978-0-9805929-0-0}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sebasfnc.com.au/ Official website]\n\n{{Ballarat Football League}}\n\n[[Category:Ballarat Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1879 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1879]]\n[[Category:Australian netball teams]]\n", "name_user": "2402:b801:387f:1800:b9f4:3858:1e98:ee83", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eClub Song)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastopol_Football_Netball_Club"}
