In addition to written and visual content each issue contained an audio CD.\n\n==History==\n''The Sienese Shredder'' was launched in 2006 by [[New York City]]-based artists [[Brice Brown]] and Trevor Winkfield. They sought to bring attention to artists, art, poetry and writing that had been largely neglected or forgotten. Often this work was completed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Mark Shortliffe took over as co-editor in 2009 for issue 4.\n\nEach issue brings together poetry, critical writing, visual arts, unpublished rarities, oddball ephemera and other culturally significant material in a way that is exciting, contemporary and fresh.

Written in 1946 and premiered in Philadelphia that year, ''Street Scene'' is based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Street Scene (play)|play of the same name]] by Rice. \n\nIt was Weill who referred to the piece as an \"American opera\", intending it as a groundbreaking synthesis of European traditional opera and American musical theater. He received the first [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for his work, after the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] premiere in 1947.<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardscategoryinfo.cfm?catname=Score Tony Award for Best Original Score.]</ref> Considered far more an opera than a musical, ''Street Scene'' is regularly produced by professional opera companies and has never been revived on Broadway. Musically and culturally, even dramatically, the work inhabits the mid-ground between Weill's ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928) and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957).\n \nThe score contains operatic arias and ensembles, some of them, such as Anna Maurrant's \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" and Frank Maurrant's \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was,\" with links and references to the style of [[Giacomo Puccini]]. It also has jazz and blues influences, in \"I Got a Marble and a Star\" and \"Lonely House\".<ref name=Thuleen/> Some of the more Broadway-style musical numbers are \"Wrapped In a Ribbon and Tied In a Bow\", \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" and \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\", an extended song-and-dance sequence. [[Benny Goodman]] and His Orchestra recorded \"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed\" with [[Johnny Mercer]] on the vocal in 1947. It was also recorded by the jazz vocal group [[The Hi-Lo's]].\n\n==Background==\nIn Germany, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Weill had already begun to use American jazz and popular song elements in his operas.  After fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933, he worked in Paris, then England, and then, beginning in 1935, in New York, US. He made a study of American popular and stage music and worked to further adapt his music to new American styles in his writing for Broadway, film and radio.  He strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be successful both commercially and artistically.<ref name=Thuleen>Thuleen, Nancy, [http://www.nthuleen.com/papers/Mus928weill.html#(10) \"Realism in Language and Music: Kurt Weill's Street Scene\"]. May 1997, accessed May 4, 2008.</ref> Weill wrote:\n: \"It's my opinion that we can and will develop a musical-dramatic form in this country (America) but I don't think it will be called 'opera', or that it will grow out of the opera which has become a thing separate from the commercial theater, dependent upon other means than box-office appeal for its continuance.  It will develop from and remain a part of the American theater \u2013 'Broadway' theater, if you like.  More than anything else, I want to be a part in that development.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 253.</ref>\n\nWeill sought to create musical theatre that would \"integrate drama and music, spoken word, song, and movement.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 359.</ref>  He further wrote:\n:\"This form of theater has its special attraction for the composer, because it allows him to use a great variety of musical idioms, to write music that is both serious and light, operatic and popular, emotional and sophisticated, orchestral and vocal. Each show of this type has to create its own style, its own texture, its own relationship between words and music, because music becomes a truly integral part of the play \u2013 it helps deepen the emotions and clarify the structure.<ref>Quoted in Graziano, John. \"Musical Dialects in Down in the Valley\", ''A New Orpheus: Essays on Kurt Weill'', ed. Kim H. Kowalke (1986), New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 299.</ref>\n\nWeill saw Rice's naturalistic play in 1930 and wanted to adapt it.  As he wrote:\n:\"It was a simple story of everyday life in a big city, a story of love and passion and greed and death.  I saw great musical possibilities in its theatrical device \u2013 life in a tenement house between one evening and the next afternoon.  And it seemed like a great challenge to me to find the inherent poetry in these people and to blend my music with the stark realism of the play.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 348.</ref>  \n\nIn 1936, Weill met Rice in New York and suggested the adaptation, but Rice turned him down.  After the successes of Weill's ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' in 1938, ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' in 1940, and ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'' in 1943 (and after Weill had composed [[incidental music]] for Rice's ''Two on an Island'' in 1939), Weill asked again, and Rice agreed.  The two chose [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet Langston Hughes to \"lift the everyday language of the people into a simple, unsophisticated poetry\", as Weill put it.<ref>Quoted, in program notes by Jane Vial Jaffe, May 2008, [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[Chautauqua Opera]] production of ''Street Scene''.</ref>\n\nIn order to enhance the realism of the new work, the collaborators utilized dialogue scenes, sometimes underscored by music.  To create music that would portray the ethnic melting pot of characters described in Rice's book, Weill travelled to neighborhoods in New York, watching children at play and observing New Yorkers. Hughes took Weill to [[Harlem]] nightclubs to hear the newest musical idioms of black American jazz and blues. Hughes wrote: \"The resulting song was composed in a national American Negro idiom; but a German, or someone else, could sing it without sounding strange or out of place.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 350.</ref>  Weill and many critics have considered the score to be his masterpiece.<ref name=Thuleen/>\n\n==Production history==\nAfter a tryout in Philadelphia, revisions were made, and ''Street Scene'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]] on January 9, 1947. It closed on May 17, 1947, after 148 performances, experiencing high running costs. The production was directed by Charles Friedman, with choreography by [[Anna Sokolow]], and produced by [[Dwight Deere Wiman]] and the [[Playwrights' Company]] ([[Maxwell Anderson]]; [[S. N. Behrman]]; [[Elmer Rice]]; [[Robert E. Sherwood]]; [[Sidney Howard]]). Scenic and lighting design were by [[Jo Mielziner]]; costume design was by [[Lucinda Ballard]]. The production starred [[Anne Jeffreys]] as Rose Maurrant, Polyna Stoska as Anna Maurrant, [[Norman Cordon]] as Frank Maurrant, Brian Sullivan as Sam Kaplan, [[Hope Emerson]] as Emma Jones, [[Sheila Bond]] as Mae Jones, and [[Danny Daniels]] as Dick McGann. Weill received the first Tony Award for Best Original Score, and Ballard received the 1947 [[Tony Award]] for Best Costume Design, competing with other strong musicals that year, notably ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' by [[Burton Lane]] and ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' by [[Frederick Loewe]]. The [[New York City Opera]] revived ''Street Scene'' several times, notably in 1959, 1979, and 1990, as stated in the ''[[New York Times]]'' review of the 1990 production linked below.\n\nIt was staged by the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based [[Minnesota Opera]] in 2001.<ref>https://www.twincities.com%2F2011%2F07%2F03%2Fgirl-fridays-street-scene-features-26-actors-doing-60-characters%2F&usg=AOvVaw0AFrLrd8k6WY0xdvJO8U1c</ref>\n\nA production by the [[English National Opera]] at the London [[Coliseum Theatre]] in 1989 included [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Mae Jones. \n\nThe Opera Group, [[Young Vic]], and [[Watford Palace Theatre]] gave the first UK production in 20 years in July 2008 [https://www.thestage.co.uk/?s=street+scene], winning the [[Evening Standard Award]] 2008 for Best Musical. Another production was performed in the grounds of the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]] on July 19, 2008, with the cast largely drawn from students from [[Trinity College of Music]].

The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank.  The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.\n\n===Act 1===\nAs the curtain rises, we are introduced to some of the residents of the apartment block where the action takes place. Emma Jones and Greta Fiorentino lament the incredible heatwave that is gripping New York (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat?''). They are joined by another neighbor Olga Olsen, who tells of the stress of dealing with her newborn baby and her husband Carl, and an old man, Abraham Kaplan, who sings of the murders and scandals in the press, whilst joining in with the opening number. Henry Davis, the janitor, enters from the basement and sings of his ambitions to greater things (''I Got A Marble And A Star''). Young Willie Maurrant enters and calls for his mother, who enters at the window and throws him a dime to buy a soda. The three women (Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Olsen) persuade Mrs. Maurrant to come downstairs and be sociable, and as she descends, they gossip about the rumour that Mrs. Maurrant and Steve Sankey, the milkman, have been having an affair (''Get A Load Of That''). Mrs. Maurrant comes down to chat and Mrs. Olsen goes back down to her cellar apartment to tend to her baby. Sam Kaplan comes out of the house and asks after Mrs. Maurrant's daughter, Rose, but she hasn't got back from work yet. He leaves to go to the library. \n\nDaniel Buchanan enters, jittery; he's nervous because his wife is upstairs about to have a baby. He and the women sing of the perils of childbirth in a short Arietta, ''When A Woman Has A Baby''. Just as he runs upstairs to tend to his wife, Mrs. Maurrant's husband Frank comes home. He mentions that he is going on a business trip to New Haven tomorrow, and argues with his wife about Rose not being home yet (''She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights''). Fuming, he storms into the house, just as George Jones returns home from work and chats with the ladies for a while. Anna Maurrant sings an aria about the importance of putting your faith in a brighter tomorrow (''Somehow I Never Could Believe''). Steve Sankey enters and a tense scene ensues between him and the suspecting women. Almost immediately after he departs, Mrs. Maurrant heads off in the same direction, under the guise of going to look for her son. Mr. Jones, Mr. Olsen, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Fiorentino sing more about the scandal (''Whatcha Think Of That''). Mrs. Olsen runs in excited and says that she has just seen Sankey and Mrs. Maurrant standing close together around the back of a local warehouse. \n\nLippo Fiorentino returns home from work with an armful of ice cream cones for everybody. The two Fiorentinos, the two Olsens, Mr. Jones and Henry Davis sing a jubilant sextet praising ice cream (''Ice Cream Sextet''). Maurrant has been watching, and when his wife comes back he questions her about where she's been. She tells him she's been looking for Willie, and Maurrant and Abraham Kaplan argue about parenting, and later economics. Kaplan uses the example of the Hildebrand family who live upstairs, who are run by a struggling single mother who is unable to pay the rent, to illustrate his point. Maurrant and Kaplan's argument almost becomes physical, but the neighbors and Kaplan's granddaughter Shirley hold the two men back. Maurrant sings about how he longs for a return to traditional moral values in ''Let Things Be Like They Always Was''. Immediately after, Jennie Hildebrand and other high-school girls enter the street coming home from their graduation ceremony. The ensemble sings a jubilant celebration number, ''Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow''. Steve Sankey's entrance causes an abrupt end to the celebrations. After the awkward silence of the neighbors forces him to leave, Sam  brings Willie Maurrant on in tears. Willie has been fighting with a local kid and Sam stepped in to break it up. Mr. Maurrant leaves to go to the local bar to have a drink, warning that there'll be trouble if Rose isn't home by the time he gets back, whilst Mrs. Maurrant takes Willie upstairs. As soon as they leave, the neighbors all begin gossiping about the Maurrant family. Sam gets passionately upset, chiding the neighbors for gossiping so much behind their backs, and then storms off. \n\nAll the neighbors say goodnight and go to bed, except Mr. Jones, who goes to the bar to shoot some pool. Sam returns onstage and sings of his crippling loneliness (''Lonely House''). Sam goes into the house, then Rose enters with her boss, Harry Easter, who has walked her home. Easter attempts to charm Rose, taking her in his arms and kissing her. He then tries to win her over with a tempting song, promising her that if she were to run away with him he could get her a gig on Broadway (''Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?''). Rose, however, sticks to her convictions, and sings a Cavatina about how she will always choose true love over showy promises (''What Good Would The Moon Be?''). Rose sees her father returning home and tells Easter to leave. Maurrant questions her about who she was talking to, and gets angry when she tells him that they had been out dancing. He goes upstairs to bed, furious. Buchanan rushes out of the house and asks Rose to go and phone the doctor, as his wife's baby is about to be born. He heads back upstairs, and as Rose is leaving, she passes young Mae Jones and her suitor, Dick McGann. The two have been out dancing and are flirting, and they sing a fast-paced jitterbug about their infatuation with one another (''Moon-faced, Starry-eyed''). After they dance on the sidewalk, they passionately run upstairs into the house, after saying a drunken good-night to Rose, who has returned from phoning the doctor. \n\nMae's brutish elder brother Vincent returns home, and begins harassing Rose. Sam sees him hassling her out of the window, and comes outside to confront him, however Vincent violently lays him out on the sidewalk. Vincent is about to continue his attack when his mother, Mrs. Jones, comes outside to see what the commotion is. He immediately seizes up and innocently goes upstairs at his mother's order. Sam and Rose are left alone, and Sam is embarrassed that he was humiliated by Vincent in front of Rose. Sam laments the terrible strife of living in the slums, but Rose calms him down by reminding him of a poem he once read her (''Remember That I Care''). Dr. Wilson arrives and goes upstairs to tend to Mrs. Buchanan, and Mr. Maurrant calls Rose and tells her to go to bed. Sam and Rose share a kiss on the sidewalk, and then Rose runs up to bed, just as Henry Davis comes upstairs and starts sweeping the stoop for the night (''I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)''). Rose calls goodnight to Sam from the window and Sam is left alone on the midnight street as the curtain slowly falls to end Act 1.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Daybreak, the next morning''\n\nMr. Jones drunkenly returns home from the bar and reels into the stinky house. Dr. Wilson leaves the house, telling Buchanan to let his wife get plenty of rest, and Dick McGann and Mae Jones share a much less passionate goodbye in the cold light of day than their energetic exchanges the night before. Willie Maurrant, Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Henry's daughter Grace, and other local children play an energetic game (''Catch Me If You Can''), which ends in a large scuffle. Rose calls for them to stop it from the window, whilst Sam comes outside and physically breaks the fight up. The children all disperse. Sam and Rose have a brief conversation, as Rose tells him that she has to go to the funeral of the head of her  real estate firm this morning. Shirley comes outside and tells Sam to come in for breakfast, as Rose goes back inside to do the dishes. Buchanan comes outside and tells the Fiorentino's that he has had a little baby girl in the night. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Maurrant enter, and Mrs. Jones asks her about Mrs. Buchanan, who Mrs. Maurrant has been looking after all night. Mrs. Jones leaves to walk her dog, and Mrs. Maurrant leaves to go to the grocery store. Rose and Mr. Maurrant come out of the house and Rose tries to persuade him to be nicer to her mother. Mrs. Maurrant returns and the three have a family argument about Mr. Maurrant's behaviour. Mrs. Maurrant asks him nonchalantly how long he'll be gone on his business trip for, and Mr. Maurrant accuses her of having an affair, which she denies. He leaves in a rage, and Mrs. Maurrant and Rose lament his behaviour (''There'll Be Trouble''). Willie comes on and Rose chides him for looking scruffy. Willie and Rose have a verbal disagreement and Rose quickly storms into the house. Mrs. Maurrant tells him that that is no way to talk to his sister, and that she is relying on him to turn into a good man when he is older (''A Boy Like You''). Willie leaves for school and Mrs. Maurrant goes into the house, as Rose comes out. Shirley Kaplan comes out of the house and asks Rose why she spends so much time with Sam, when he should be concentrating on his work. Shirley leaves for work, and Vincent Jones comes out of the house and starts harassing Rose again, but promptly leaves as Sam comes out of the house. Rose mentions Easter's tempting offer of running away to Sam, and Sam gets upset, saying that she would be better off running away with him, and the two sing of their intention to run away together (''We'll Go Away Together''). Easter arrives to walk Rose to the funeral, and the two leave. Sam goes into the house, as Sankey appears. Mrs. Maurrant appears at her window and tells him to come upstairs, as Mr. Maurrant has gone on his business trip and Rose will be at the funeral all morning. As Sankey hurries upstairs he passes Sam coming out of the house, who looks up at the window and sees Mrs. Maurrant pulling the shades shut. Sam sits on the stoop and reads a book, as James Henry, a city-marshall, and Fred Cullen, his assistant, appear. They call Henry Davis up and tell him that they're here to dispossess the Hildebrand family, and that since she has made no arrangements to have the furniture taken away, they'll have to dump it on the sidewalk. Henry goes back into the cellar as the two men enter the house. Mr. Maurrant returns, having changed his mind about the business trip. He sees the shades pulled shut and becomes furious. Sam pleads with him not to enter the house but he pushes him aside and runs upstairs. Mrs. Maurrant is heard screaming, and then two gunshots. Sankey appears at the window in terror, he tries to escape but Maurrant pulls him back inside and shoots him. Panic ensues, as Maurrant exits the house, covered in blood, and points his revolver at the crowd of gatherers in order to make his escape. Policemen, paramedics, concerned neighbors flood the scene. Rose returns from the funeral and sees the concerned crowd. Sam tries to keep her back but she cannot be restrained. The ensemble sings a tragic chorus number about the killing, ''The Woman Who Lived Up There''. Mrs. Maurrant's body is brought out of the house on a stretcher and taken to the hospital and the citizens rush after the ambulance, as Rose, quietly crying in Sam's arms, follows. The curtain slowly falls as the two city-marshalls continue bringing the Hildebrand furniture out onto the sidewalk.\n\n''Scene 2: Mid-afternoon, the same day''\n\nTwo young nursemaids appear at the house and sing about the scandal of the murder that has already spread around the city, as they try to quiet the children they are looking after (''Lullaby''). As the nursemaids leave, Rose enters, dressed in black. She asks Officer Murphy, the policeman who is still in her apartment, if they have found her father yet, and he tells her that they haven't. Sam enters and tells Rose that he has taken Willie from school round to her aunt's house. Shirley enters and expresses her condolences to Rose, and the two of them go up to Rose's apartment together, as Rose is afraid to go up alone. Sam tells his grandfather that the police are going to make him testify against Maurrant, when two shots are heard in the distance. Buchanan and Olsen run on and tell Sam and Rose (who has run out of the house, alerted by the noise) that the police have found her father hiding in the basement of a house down the street. Two policemen bring on Maurrant, who is covered in blood and dirt. The officers are taking him away when he begs for one minute with his daughter, which they grant him. He and Rose talk about the murder, as the crowd looks on (''He Loved Her Too''). The officers take Maurrant off, and Rose and Sam are left alone onstage. Rose starts to enter the house when Sam asks what she's going to do. She tells him she'll go away, but when he says that he'll go with her as they discussed that morning, Rose says she has to go off alone. Sam finally confesses to Rose that he is in love with her, and that his life is nothing without her. Rose says that her parents have proved that two people do not belong together, and she says goodbye to Sam (''Don't Forget The Lilac Bush''). Shirley comes out of the house and hands Rose a suitcase full of her things. Rose starts walking off, then returns and swiftly kisses Sam, but he breaks away and goes abruptly into the house. Rose stands looking after him, then picks up her bag and walks off. Mrs. Fiorentino, Mrs. Olsen and Mrs. Jones appear and immediately begin gossiping about Rose and Easter hanging around on the street late last night (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat? (Reprise)''), as they once again lament the unbearable heat and the curtain slowly falls.\n\n====Songs====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Ain't It Awful, The Heat?\" \u2013 Greta Fiorentino, Emma Jones, Olga and Carl Olsen, Abraham Kaplan\n* \"I Got A Marble And A Star\" \u2013 Henry Davis\n* \"Get A Load Of That\" \u2013 Emma Jones, Greta Fiorentino, Olga Olsen\n* \"When A Woman Has A Baby\" \u2013 Daniel Buchanan, Greta Fiorentino, Emma Jones, Anna Maurrant\n* \"She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights\" \u2013 Frank and Anna Maurrant, Greta Fiorentino\n* \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" \u2013 Anna Maurrant\n* \"Whatcha Think Of That?\" \u2013 Emma and George Jones, Carl Olsen, Greta Fiorentino\n* \"Ice Cream Sextet\" \u2013 Lippo and Greta Fiorentino, Carl and Olga Olsen, George Jones, Henry Davis\n* \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was\" \u2013 Frank Maurrant\n* \"Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow\" \u2013 Jennie Hildebrand, Ensemble\n* \"Lonely House\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan\n* \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" \u2013 Harry Easter\n* \"What Good Would The Moon Be?\" \u2013 Rose Maurrant\n* \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\" \u2013 Dick McGann, Mae Jones\n* \"Remember That I Care\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan, Rose Maurrant\n* \"I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)\" \u2013 Henry Davis\n{{col-break}}\n\n;Act 2\n* \"Catch Me If You Can\" \u2013 Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Willie Maurrant, Grace Davis, Children\n* \"There'll Be Trouble\" \u2013 Frank, Rose and Anna Maurrant\n* \"A Boy Like You\" \u2013 Anna Maurrant\n* \"We'll Go Away Together\" \u2013 Rose Maurrant, Sam Kaplan\n* \"The Woman Who Lived Up There\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Lullaby\" \u2013 Nursemaid #1, Nursemaid #2\n* \"I Loved Her, Too\" \u2013 Frank and Rose Maurrant, Ensemble\n* \"Don't Forget The Lilac Bush\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan, Rose Maurrant\n* \"Ain't It Awful, The Heat?

Written in 1946 and premiered in Philadelphia that year, ''Street Scene'' is based on the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Street Scene (play)|play of the same name]] by Rice. \n\nIt was Weill who referred to the piece as an \"American opera\", intending it as a groundbreaking synthesis of European traditional opera and American musical theater. He received the first [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for his work, after the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] premiere in 1947.<ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardscategoryinfo.cfm?catname=Score Tony Award for Best Original Score.]</ref> Considered far more an opera than a musical, ''Street Scene'' is regularly produced by professional opera companies and has never been revived on Broadway. Musically and culturally, even dramatically, the work inhabits the mid-ground between Weill's ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928) and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957).\n \nThe score contains operatic arias and ensembles, some of them, such as Anna Maurrant's \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" and Frank Maurrant's \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was,\" with links and references to the style of [[Giacomo Puccini]]. It also has jazz and blues influences, in \"I Got a Marble and a Star\" and \"Lonely House\".<ref name=Thuleen/> Some of the more Broadway-style musical numbers are \"Wrapped In a Ribbon and Tied In a Bow\", \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" and \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\", an extended song-and-dance sequence. [[Benny Goodman]] and His Orchestra recorded \"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed\" with [[Johnny Mercer]] on the vocal in 1947. It was also recorded by the jazz vocal group [[The Hi-Lo's]].\n\n==Background==\nIn Germany, in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Weill had already begun to use American jazz and popular song elements in his operas.  After fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933, he worked in Paris, then England, and then, beginning in 1935, in New York, US. He made a study of American popular and stage music and worked to further adapt his music to new American styles in his writing for Broadway, film and radio.  He strove to find a new way of creating an American opera that would be successful both commercially and artistically.<ref name=Thuleen>Thuleen, Nancy, [http://www.nthuleen.com/papers/Mus928weill.html#(10) \"Realism in Language and Music: Kurt Weill's Street Scene\"]. May 1997, accessed May 4, 2008.</ref> Weill wrote:\n: \"It's my opinion that we can and will develop a musical-dramatic form in this country (America) but I don't think it will be called 'opera', or that it will grow out of the opera which has become a thing separate from the commercial theater, dependent upon other means than box-office appeal for its continuance.  It will develop from and remain a part of the American theater \u2013 'Broadway' theater, if you like.  More than anything else, I want to be a part in that development.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 253.</ref>\n\nWeill sought to create musical theatre that would \"integrate drama and music, spoken word, song, and movement.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 359.</ref>  He further wrote:\n:\"This form of theater has its special attraction for the composer, because it allows him to use a great variety of musical idioms, to write music that is both serious and light, operatic and popular, emotional and sophisticated, orchestral and vocal. Each show of this type has to create its own style, its own texture, its own relationship between words and music, because music becomes a truly integral part of the play \u2013 it helps deepen the emotions and clarify the structure.<ref>Quoted in Graziano, John. \"Musical Dialects in Down in the Valley\", ''A New Orpheus: Essays on Kurt Weill'', ed. Kim H. Kowalke (1986), New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 299.</ref>\n\nWeill saw Rice's naturalistic play in 1930 and wanted to adapt it.  As he wrote:\n:\"It was a simple story of everyday life in a big city, a story of love and passion and greed and death.  I saw great musical possibilities in its theatrical device \u2013 life in a tenement house between one evening and the next afternoon.  And it seemed like a great challenge to me to find the inherent poetry in these people and to blend my music with the stark realism of the play.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 348.</ref>  \n\nIn 1936, Weill met Rice in New York and suggested the adaptation, but Rice turned him down.  After the successes of Weill's ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' in 1938, ''[[Lady in the Dark]]'' in 1940, and ''[[One Touch of Venus]]'' in 1943 (and after Weill had composed [[incidental music]] for Rice's ''Two on an Island'' in 1939), Weill asked again, and Rice agreed.  The two chose [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet Langston Hughes to \"lift the everyday language of the people into a simple, unsophisticated poetry\", as Weill put it.<ref>Quoted, in program notes by Jane Vial Jaffe, May 2008, [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[Chautauqua Opera]] production of ''Street Scene''.</ref>\n\nIn order to enhance the realism of the new work, the collaborators utilized dialogue scenes, sometimes underscored by music.  To create music that would portray the ethnic melting pot of characters described in Rice's book, Weill travelled to neighborhoods in New York, watching children at play and observing New Yorkers. Hughes took Weill to [[Harlem]] nightclubs to hear the newest musical idioms of black American jazz and blues. Hughes wrote: \"The resulting song was composed in a national American Negro idiom; but a German, or someone else, could sing it without sounding strange or out of place.\"<ref>Sanders, p. 350.</ref>  Weill and many critics have considered the score to be his masterpiece.<ref name=Thuleen/>\n\n==Production history==\nAfter a tryout in Philadelphia, revisions were made, and ''Street Scene'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]] on January 9, 1947. It closed on May 17, 1947, after 148 performances, experiencing high running costs. The production was directed by Charles Friedman, with choreography by [[Anna Sokolow]], and produced by [[Dwight Deere Wiman]] and the [[Playwrights' Company]] ([[Maxwell Anderson]]; [[S. N. Behrman]]; [[Elmer Rice]]; [[Robert E. Sherwood]]; [[Sidney Howard]]). Scenic and lighting design were by [[Jo Mielziner]]; costume design was by [[Lucinda Ballard]]. The production starred [[Anne Jeffreys]] as Rose Maurrant, Polyna Stoska as Anna Maurrant, [[Norman Cordon]] as Frank Maurrant, Brian Sullivan as Sam Kaplan, [[Hope Emerson]] as Emma Jones, [[Sheila Bond]] as Mae Jones, and [[Danny Daniels]] as Dick McGann. Weill received the first Tony Award for Best Original Score, and Ballard received the 1947 [[Tony Award]] for Best Costume Design, competing with other strong musicals that year, notably ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' by [[Burton Lane]] and ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'' by [[Frederick Loewe]]. The [[New York City Opera]] revived ''Street Scene'' several times, notably in 1959, 1979, and 1990, as stated in the ''[[New York Times]]'' review of the 1990 production linked below.\n\nIt was staged by the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based [[Minnesota Opera]] in 2001. <ref>https://www.twincities.com%2F2011%2F07%2F03%2Fgirl-fridays-street-scene-features-26-actors-doing-60-characters%2F&usg=AOvVaw0AFrLrd8k6WY0xdvJO8U1c</ref>\n\nA production by the [[English National Opera]] at the London [[Coliseum Theatre]] in 1989 included [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Mae Jones. \n\nThe Opera Group, [[Young Vic]], and [[Watford Palace Theatre]] gave the first UK production in 20 years in July 2008 [https://www.thestage.co.uk/?s=street+scene], winning the [[Evening Standard Award]] 2008 for Best Musical. Another production was performed in the grounds of the [[Old Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]] on July 19, 2008, with the cast largely drawn from students from [[Trinity College of Music]]. In 2011 ''Street Scene'' was performed by the Opera/Music Theatre Workshop of [[Southeastern Louisiana University]]<ref>The production played to a packed Pottle Music Auditorium on February 4\u20135, 2011.{{cite news \n|first = Jordan\n|last = Whitworth\n|title = 'Street Scene' sees success\n|page = 4\n|date = February 8, 2011\n|url = http://media-newswire.com/release_1139700.html\n|newspaper = Lion's Roar\n|place = Hammond, Louisiana\n|publisher = Southeastern Louisiana University\n}} (Print article differs significantly from online press release.)</ref> and, in German, by the [[Bayerische Theaterakademie August Everding]] and the [[Munich Radio Orchestra]], led by [[Ulf Schirmer]].\n\nThe Opera Group presented the first performance in Austria in October 2011, and the [[Semper Oper]] in [[Dresden]] produced the work to great acclaim earlier in 2011.

The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank.  The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.\n\n===Act 1===\nAs the curtain rises, we are introduced to some of the residents of the apartment block where the action takes place. Emma Jones and Greta Fiorentino lament the incredible heatwave that is gripping New York (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat?''). They are joined by another neighbor Olga Olsen, who tells of the stress of dealing with her newborn baby and her husband Carl, and an old man, Abraham Kaplan, who sings of the murders and scandals in the press, whilst joining in with the opening number. Henry Davis, the janitor, enters from the basement and sings of his ambitions to greater things (''I Got A Marble And A Star''). Young Willie Maurrant enters and calls for his mother, who enters at the window and throws him a dime to buy a soda. The three women (Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Olsen) persuade Mrs. Maurrant to come downstairs and be sociable, and as she descends, they gossip about the rumour that Mrs. Maurrant and Steve Sankey, the milkman, have been having an affair (''Get A Load Of That''). Mrs. Maurrant comes down to chat and Mrs. Olsen goes back down to her cellar apartment to tend to her baby. Sam Kaplan comes out of the house and asks after Mrs. Maurrant's daughter, Rose, but she hasn't got back from work yet. He leaves to go to the library. \n\nDaniel Buchanan enters, jittery; he's nervous because his wife is upstairs about to have a baby. He and the women sing of the perils of childbirth in a short Arietta, ''When A Woman Has A Baby''. Just as he runs upstairs to tend to his wife, Mrs. Maurrant's husband Frank comes home. He mentions that he is going on a business trip to New Haven tomorrow, and argues with his wife about Rose not being home yet (''She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights''). Fuming, he storms into the house, just as George Jones returns home from work and chats with the ladies for a while. Anna Maurrant sings an aria about the importance of putting your faith in a brighter tomorrow (''Somehow I Never Could Believe''). Steve Sankey enters and a tense scene ensues between him and the suspecting women. Almost immediately after he departs, Mrs. Maurrant heads off in the same direction, under the guise of going to look for her son. Mr. Jones, Mr. Olsen, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Fiorentino sing more about the scandal (''Whatcha Think Of That''). Mrs. Olsen runs in excited and says that she has just seen Sankey and Mrs. Maurrant standing close together around the back of a local warehouse. \n\nLippo Fiorentino returns home from work with an armful of ice cream cones for everybody. The two Fiorentinos, the two Olsens, Mr. Jones and Henry Davis sing a jubilant sextet praising ice cream (''Ice Cream Sextet''). Maurrant has been watching, and when his wife comes back he questions her about where she's been. She tells him she's been looking for Willie, and Maurrant and Abraham Kaplan argue about parenting, and later economics. Kaplan uses the example of the Hildebrand family who live upstairs, who are run by a struggling single mother who is unable to pay the rent, to illustrate his point. Maurrant and Kaplan's argument almost becomes physical, but the neighbors and Kaplan's granddaughter Shirley hold the two men back. Maurrant sings about how he longs for a return to traditional moral values in ''Let Things Be Like They Always Was''. Immediately after, Jennie Hildebrand and other high-school girls enter the street coming home from their graduation ceremony. The ensemble sings a jubilant celebration number, ''Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow''. Steve Sankey's entrance causes an abrupt end to the celebrations. After the awkward silence of the neighbors forces him to leave, Sam  brings Willie Maurrant on in tears. Willie has been fighting with a local kid and Sam stepped in to break it up. Mr. Maurrant leaves to go to the local bar to have a drink, warning that there'll be trouble if Rose isn't home by the time he gets back, whilst Mrs. Maurrant takes Willie upstairs. As soon as they leave, the neighbors all begin gossiping about the Maurrant family. Sam gets passionately upset, chiding the neighbors for gossiping so much behind their backs, and then storms off. \n\nAll the neighbors say goodnight and go to bed, except Mr. Jones, who goes to the bar to shoot some pool. Sam returns onstage and sings of his crippling loneliness (''Lonely House''). Sam goes into the house, then Rose enters with her boss, Harry Easter, who has walked her home. Easter attempts to charm Rose, taking her in his arms and kissing her. He then tries to win her over with a tempting song, promising her that if she were to run away with him he could get her a gig on Broadway (''Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?''). Rose, however, sticks to her convictions, and sings a Cavatina about how she will always choose true love over showy promises (''What Good Would The Moon Be?''). Rose sees her father returning home and tells Easter to leave. Maurrant questions her about who she was talking to, and gets angry when she tells him that they had been out dancing. He goes upstairs to bed, furious. Buchanan rushes out of the house and asks Rose to go and phone the doctor, as his wife's baby is about to be born. He heads back upstairs, and as Rose is leaving, she passes young Mae Jones and her suitor, Dick McGann. The two have been out dancing and are flirting, and they sing a fast-paced jitterbug about their infatuation with one another (''Moon-faced, Starry-eyed''). After they dance on the sidewalk, they passionately run upstairs into the house, after saying a drunken good-night to Rose, who has returned from phoning the doctor. \n\nMae's brutish elder brother Vincent returns home, and begins harassing Rose. Sam sees him hassling her out of the window, and comes outside to confront him, however Vincent violently lays him out on the sidewalk. Vincent is about to continue his attack when his mother, Mrs. Jones, comes outside to see what the commotion is. He immediately seizes up and innocently goes upstairs at his mother's order. Sam and Rose are left alone, and Sam is embarrassed that he was humiliated by Vincent in front of Rose. Sam laments the terrible strife of living in the slums, but Rose calms him down by reminding him of a poem he once read her (''Remember That I Care''). Dr. Wilson arrives and goes upstairs to tend to Mrs. Buchanan, and Mr. Maurrant calls Rose and tells her to go to bed. Sam and Rose share a kiss on the sidewalk, and then Rose runs up to bed, just as Henry Davis comes upstairs and starts sweeping the stoop for the night (''I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)''). Rose calls goodnight to Sam from the window and Sam is left alone on the midnight street as the curtain slowly falls to end Act 1.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Scene 1: Daybreak, the next morning''\n\nMr. Jones drunkenly returns home from the bar and reels into the stinky house. Dr. Wilson leaves the house, telling Buchanan to let his wife get plenty of rest, and Dick McGann and Mae Jones share a much less passionate goodbye in the cold light of day than their energetic exchanges the night before. Willie Maurrant, Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Henry's daughter Grace, and other local children play an energetic game (''Catch Me If You Can''), which ends in a large scuffle. Rose calls for them to stop it from the window, whilst Sam comes outside and physically breaks the fight up. The children all disperse. Sam and Rose have a brief conversation, as Rose tells him that she has to go to the funeral of the head of her  real estate firm this morning. Shirley comes outside and tells Sam to come in for breakfast, as Rose goes back inside to do the dishes. Buchanan comes outside and tells the Fiorentino's that he has had a little baby girl in the night. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Maurrant enter, and Mrs. Jones asks her about Mrs. Buchanan, who Mrs. Maurrant has been looking after all night. Mrs. Jones leaves to walk her dog, and Mrs. Maurrant leaves to go to the grocery store. Rose and Mr. Maurrant come out of the house and Rose tries to persuade him to be nicer to her mother. Mrs. Maurrant returns and the three have a family argument about Mr. Maurrant's behaviour. Mrs. Maurrant asks him nonchalantly how long he'll be gone on his business trip for, and Mr. Maurrant accuses her of having an affair, which she denies. He leaves in a rage, and Mrs. Maurrant and Rose lament his behaviour (''There'll Be Trouble''). Willie comes on and Rose chides him for looking scruffy. Willie and Rose have a verbal disagreement and Rose quickly storms into the house. Mrs. Maurrant tells him that that is no way to talk to his sister, and that she is relying on him to turn into a good man when he is older (''A Boy Like You''). Willie leaves for school and Mrs. Maurrant goes into the house, as Rose comes out. Shirley Kaplan comes out of the house and asks Rose why she spends so much time with Sam, when he should be concentrating on his work. Shirley leaves for work, and Vincent Jones comes out of the house and starts harassing Rose again, but promptly leaves as Sam comes out of the house. Rose mentions Easter's tempting offer of running away to Sam, and Sam gets upset, saying that she would be better off running away with him, and the two sing of their intention to run away together (''We'll Go Away Together''). Easter arrives to walk Rose to the funeral, and the two leave. Sam goes into the house, as Sankey appears. Mrs. Maurrant appears at her window and tells him to come upstairs, as Mr. Maurrant has gone on his business trip and Rose will be at the funeral all morning. As Sankey hurries upstairs he passes Sam coming out of the house, who looks up at the window and sees Mrs. Maurrant pulling the shades shut. Sam sits on the stoop and reads a book, as James Henry, a city-marshall, and Fred Cullen, his assistant, appear. They call Henry Davis up and tell him that they're here to dispossess the Hildebrand family, and that since she has made no arrangements to have the furniture taken away, they'll have to dump it on the sidewalk. Henry goes back into the cellar as the two men enter the house. Mr. Maurrant returns, having changed his mind about the business trip. He sees the shades pulled shut and becomes furious. Sam pleads with him not to enter the house but he pushes him aside and runs upstairs. Mrs. Maurrant is heard screaming, and then two gunshots. Sankey appears at the window in terror, he tries to escape but Maurrant pulls him back inside and shoots him. Panic ensues, as Maurrant exits the house, covered in blood, and points his revolver at the crowd of gatherers in order to make his escape. Policemen, paramedics, concerned neighbors flood the scene. Rose returns from the funeral and sees the concerned crowd. Sam tries to keep her back but she cannot be restrained. The ensemble sings a tragic chorus number about the killing, ''The Woman Who Lived Up There''. Mrs. Maurrant's body is brought out of the house on a stretcher and taken to the hospital and the citizens rush after the ambulance, as Rose, quietly crying in Sam's arms, follows. The curtain slowly falls as the two city-marshalls continue bringing the Hildebrand furniture out onto the sidewalk.\n\n''Scene 2: Mid-afternoon, the same day''\n\nTwo young nursemaids appear at the house and sing about the scandal of the murder that has already spread around the city, as they try to quiet the children they are looking after (''Lullaby''). As the nursemaids leave, Rose enters, dressed in black. She asks Officer Murphy, the policeman who is still in her apartment, if they have found her father yet, and he tells her that they haven't. Sam enters and tells Rose that he has taken Willie from school round to her aunt's house. Shirley enters and expresses her condolences to Rose, and the two of them go up to Rose's apartment together, as Rose is afraid to go up alone. Sam tells his grandfather that the police are going to make him testify against Maurrant, when two shots are heard in the distance. Buchanan and Olsen run on and tell Sam and Rose (who has run out of the house, alerted by the noise) that the police have found her father hiding in the basement of a house down the street. Two policemen bring on Maurrant, who is covered in blood and dirt. The officers are taking him away when he begs for one minute with his daughter, which they grant him. He and Rose talk about the murder, as the crowd looks on (''He Loved Her Too''). The officers take Maurrant off, and Rose and Sam are left alone onstage. Rose starts to enter the house when Sam asks what she's going to do. She tells him she'll go away, but when he says that he'll go with her as they discussed that morning, Rose says she has to go off alone. Sam finally confesses to Rose that he is in love with her, and that his life is nothing without her. Rose says that her parents have proved that two people do not belong together, and she says goodbye to Sam (''Don't Forget The Lilac Bush''). Shirley comes out of the house and hands Rose a suitcase full of her things. Rose starts walking off, then returns and swiftly kisses Sam, but he breaks away and goes abruptly into the house. Rose stands looking after him, then picks up her bag and walks off. Mrs. Fiorentino, Mrs. Olsen and Mrs. Jones appear and immediately begin gossiping about Rose and Easter hanging around on the street late last night (''Ain't It Awful, The Heat? (Reprise)''), as they once again lament the unbearable heat and the curtain slowly falls.\n\n====Songs====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Ain't It Awful, The Heat?\" \u2013 Greta Fiorentino, Emma Jones, Olga and Carl Olsen, Abraham Kaplan\n* \"I Got A Marble And A Star\" \u2013 Henry Davis\n* \"Get A Load Of That\" \u2013 Emma Jones, Greta Fiorentino, Olga Olsen\n* \"When A Woman Has A Baby\" \u2013 Daniel Buchanan, Greta Fiorentino, Emma Jones, Anna Maurrant\n* \"She Shouldn't Be Staying Out Nights\" \u2013 Frank and Anna Maurrant, Greta Fiorentino\n* \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" \u2013 Anna Maurrant\n* \"Whatcha Think Of That?\" \u2013 Emma and George Jones, Carl Olsen, Greta Fiorentino\n* \"Ice Cream Sextet\" \u2013 Lippo and Greta Fiorentino, Carl and Olga Olsen, George Jones, Henry Davis\n* \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was\" \u2013 Frank Maurrant\n* \"Wrapped In A Ribbon And Tied In A Bow\" \u2013 Jennie Hildebrand, Ensemble\n* \"Lonely House\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan\n* \"Wouldn't You Like To Be On Broadway?\" \u2013 Harry Easter\n* \"What Good Would The Moon Be?\" \u2013 Rose Maurrant\n* \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\" \u2013 Dick McGann, Mae Jones\n* \"Remember That I Care\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan, Rose Maurrant\n* \"I Got A Marble And A Star (Reprise)\" \u2013 Henry Davis\n{{col-break}}\n\n;Act 2\n* \"Catch Me If You Can\" \u2013 Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Willie Maurrant, Grace Davis, Children\n* \"There'll Be Trouble\" \u2013 Frank, Rose and Anna Maurrant\n* \"A Boy Like You\" \u2013 Anna Maurrant\n* \"We'll Go Away Together\" \u2013 Rose Maurrant, Sam Kaplan\n* \"The Woman Who Lived Up There\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Lullaby\" \u2013 Nursemaid #1, Nursemaid #2\n* \"I Loved Her, Too\" \u2013 Frank and Rose Maurrant, Ensemble\n* \"Don't Forget The Lilac Bush\" \u2013 Sam Kaplan, Rose Maurrant\n* \"Ain't It Awful, The Heat?

The Ancient Romans were awestruck by the obelisks they saw, and looted the various [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes, in one case they destroyed walls at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]] to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.\n\nThe largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> More well known is the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]].<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Brought to Rome by the Emperor [[Caligula]] in AD 37, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica.\n\n{{quote|The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.\n\nThree more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [[Piazza del Popolo]], in 1589.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel \u2013 Titelansicht \u2013 ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich (NEBIS) \u2013 e-rara|publisher=|doi = 10.3931/e-rara-117|year = 1590|last1 = Fontana|first1 = Domenico}}</ref> An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]].

The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.\n\nNot all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome.

The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.\n\nThe Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu).

Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in \"stelae fields\".\n\n===Ancient Roman===\nThe Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations.

The Ancient Romans were awestruck by the obelisks they saw, and looted the various [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes, in one case they destroyed walls at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]] to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.\n\nThe largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> More well known is the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]].<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Brought to Rome by the Emperor [[Caligula]] in AD 37, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica.\n\n{{quote|The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.\n\nThree more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [[Piazza del Popolo]], in 1589.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel \u2013 Titelansicht \u2013 ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich (NEBIS) \u2013 e-rara|publisher=|doi = 10.3931/e-rara-117|year = 1590|last1 = Fontana|first1 = Domenico}}</ref> An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]].

The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.\n\nNot all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome.

The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers.

Long housed in the ''[[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda, Antropolog\u00eda e Historia del Per\u00fa]]'' in [[Lima]], it was relocated to the ''Museo Nacional de Chav\u00edn'', which opened in July 2008. The obelisk was named for the archeologist [[Julio C. Tello]], who discovered it and was considered the \"father of Peruvian archeology.\"  He was America's first [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] archeologist.<ref name=\"iowa\">[http://www.uiowapress.org/books/2009-spring/burger.htm Richard L.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000-year-old [[papyrus]] [[scroll]] in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for \"thy lord\". The scroll reads \"Empty the space that has been filled with sand beneath the monument of thy Lord.\"<ref>[[Nova (American TV program)|NOVA (TV series)]] ''Secrets of Lost Empire II'': \"Pharaoh's Obelisks\"</ref> To erect the obelisks at Luxor with this method would have involved using over a million cubic meters of stone, mud brick and sand for both the ramp and the platform used to lower the obelisk.<ref>''Time Life Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile'', New York: TIME/Life, 1993, pp. 56\u201357</ref> The largest obelisk successfully erected in ancient times weighed {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.
