Historically the term '''electric street railways''' was also used in the United States. In the United States, the term ''tram'' has sometimes been used for rubber-tired [[trackless train]]s, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.\n\nTram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and [[rapid transit]] trains. Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] sliding on an [[overhead line]]; older systems may use a [[trolley pole]] or a [[bow collector]]. In some cases, a [[contact shoe]] on a [[third rail]] is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems\u2014electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry [[freight (rail)|freight]].\n\nTrams are now commonly included in the wider term \"[[light rail]]\",<ref>Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014 \u00a9 HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014</ref> which also includes [[grade-separated]] systems. Some trams, known as [[tram-train]]s, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to [[interurban]] systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features.\n\nOne of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low [[rolling resistance]] of metal wheels on [[steel]] rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Problems included the high [[total cost of ownership]] of horses. Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in the mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence in recent years.\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\nThe English terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' are derived from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word {{lang|sco|tram}},<ref>{{cite web|url = https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/tram_n_2 |title = tram, n.<sup>2</sup> |work = A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (up to 1700)|publisher = Dictionary of the Scots Language}}</ref> referring respectively to a type of truck ([[goods wagon]] or freight [[railroad car]]) used in [[coal mining|coal mines]] and the tracks on which they ran. The word ''tram'' probably derived from [[Middle Dutch|Middle Flemish]] {{lang |dum|trame}} (\"beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung\"). The identical word {{lang|fr|la trame}} with the meaning \"crossbeam\" is also used in the [[French language]]. Etymologists believe that the word ''tram'' refers to the wooden beams the railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad pioneers switched to the much more wear-resistant tracks made of iron and, later, steel.<ref>Duden-das Herkunftsw\u00f6rterbuch-Etymologie der deutschen Sprache-Mannheim 2001 p859</ref> The word ''Tram-car'' is attested from 1873.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tram |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510061427/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tram |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Go by Streetcar sign - Portland Oregon.jpg|thumb|A sign in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] that reads \"go by streetcar.\" Trams are typically called streetcars in North America.]]\nAlthough the terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' have been adopted by many languages, they are not used universally in English; North Americans prefer ''streetcar'', ''trolley'', or ''trolleycar''. The term ''streetcar'' is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to [[horsecar]]s. When electrification came, Americans began to speak of ''trolleycars'' or later, ''trolleys''. A widely held belief holds the word to derive from the ''troller'' (said to derive from the words ''traveler'' and ''roller''), a four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car and collected electrical power from the [[overhead wire]]s;<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

Middleton|Middleton, William D.]] (1967). ''The Time of the Trolley'', p. 60. Milwaukee: Kalmbach Publishing. {{ISBN|0-89024-013-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe alternative North American term 'trolley' may strictly speaking be considered incorrect, as the term can also be applied to cable cars, or [[conduit car]]s that instead draw power from an underground supply. Conventional diesel [[bus|tourist buses]] decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called ''trolleys'' in the US ([[tourist trolley]]). Furthering confusion, the term ''tram'' has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed [[trackless train|segmented vehicles on rubber tires]] generally used to ferry tourists short distances, for example on the [[Universal Studios Backlot Tour|Universal Studios backlot tour]] and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]].\n\nAlthough the use of the term ''trolley'' for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later associated with the ''[[trolleybus]]'', a rubber-tyred vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called ''trackless trolleys'' (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply ''trolleys'' (in the UK, as well as the [[Pacific Northwest]], including [[Seattle]], and [[Vancouver]]).\n\nThe [[New South Wales]] government in Australia has decided to use the term \"light rail\" for their trams.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of trams}}\n\nThe history of trams, streetcars or trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth century. It can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of motive power used.\n\n===Horse-drawn===\n{{Main|Horsecar}}\n[[File:Horsetrain 1870.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn tram operated by [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]], 1870.

Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride. There are records of a street railway running in [[Baltimore]] as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America, was the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] developed by the Irish coach builder [[John Stephenson (coachbuilder)|John Stephenson]], in New York City which began service in the year 1832.{{sfn|Dunbar|1967|pp=16\u201317}}<ref>[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co].

In 1848, it was closed down after repeated economic failure..........No reference given for this claim, and it is contradicted by many sources but please unhide this if a suitable reference is found --> \nThe first permanent tram line in continental Europe was opened in Paris in 1855 by [[Alphonse Loubat]] who had previously worked on American streetcar lines.{{sfn|Dunbar|1967|p=21}} The tram was developed in numerous cities of Europe (some of the most extensive systems were found in Berlin, [[Budapest]], [[Birmingham Corporation Tramways|Birmingham]], [[Leningrad]], [[Lisbon]], [[London County Council Tramways|London]],  [[Manchester Corporation Tramways|Manchester]], [[Tramways in Paris#History|Paris]]).\n[[File:Horsedrawn tram which ran between Newtown Station and St Peters.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn [[Trams in Sydney|tram in Sydney]], 1894. The city saw Australia's first tram service open in 1860.]]\nThe first tram in South America opened in 1858 in [[List of town tramway systems in Chile|Santiago, Chile]]. The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. Africa's first tram service started in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]] on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].\n\nProblems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing of. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.\n\nHorsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.<ref name=\"siemens.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|title=Transportation Technology|website=www.siemens.com|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729124510/https://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|archive-date=29 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:The last of the Horse Drawn Carriages.JPG|thumb|Horse-drawn trams continued to be used in [[New York City]] until 1917.]]\nHorses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century, and many large metropolitan lines lasted into the early 20th century.

Generally, there were two types of steam tram. The first and most common had a small [[steam locomotive]] (called a [[tram engine]] in the UK) at the head of a line of one or more carriages, similar to a small train.

The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Trams in Rockhampton|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.\n\nTram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.\n\n===Cable-hauled===\n{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}\n[[File:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|Winding drums of the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway]]\nAnother motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \"powerhouse\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle. The [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal|publisher=Wiley & Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}</ref>\n\nThe first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.\n\nThe most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Cable cars in Chicago|Chicago]], having been built in stages between 1859 and 1892. New York City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bowery boys : adventures In Old New York : an unconventional exploration of Manhattan's historic neighborhoods, secret spots and colorful characters |publisher=Ulysses Press |isbn=1612435769 |page=179 |date=18 April 2016 }}</ref> Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.\n[[File:Melbourne\u2019s first cable tram.jpg|thumb|The first [[Melbourne cable tramway system|cable car service in Melbourne]], 1885. From its founding to 1940, Melbourne operated one of the largest cable car networks in the world.]]\nFrom 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track. There were also two isolated cable lines in [[Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,<ref>[[Trams in Sydney]]</ref> and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.\n\nIn [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1901 an elevated [[suspension railway|suspended]] cable car following the ''Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system'' started operating. Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around \"Upper Douglas\" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).\n\nCable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\"dropped\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \"picked up\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.\n[[File:San Francisco Cable Car MC.jpg|thumb|left|A [[San Francisco cable cars|San Francisco cable car]] in 2008. The cable car's effectiveness in hilly environments partially explains its continued use in San Francisco.]]\nCable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.\n\nThe [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the \"[[Wellington Cable Car]]\"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.\n\n===Gas===\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886\u20131888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1921\u20131951); between [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobiesz\u00f3w]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896\u20131920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897\u20131908).\n\nOn 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nComparatively little has been published about gas trams.

Derailed electric trams are a hazard, as it requires contact with the rails for the current's return path.]]\nThere is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC. In British terminology, such a tram was said to be \u2018grounded\u2019\u2014not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event, the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs.

The motivation now is to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and damage to road surfaces in city centres.\n\nOne recent proposal to bring cargo tramways back into wider use was the plan by [[City Cargo Amsterdam]] to reintroduce them into the city of [[Amsterdam]]. In the spring of 2007 the city piloted this cargo tram operation, which among its aims aimed to reduce [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] pollution in the city by 20% by halving the number of [[lorries]] (5,000) unloading in the [[inner city]] during the permitted timeframe from 07:00 till 10:30. The pilot involved two cargo trams, operating from a distribution centre and delivering to a \"hub\" where special electric trucks delivered the trams' small [[Shipping container|containers]] to their final destination. The trial was successful, releasing an intended investment of \u20ac100&nbsp;million in a [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]] of 52 cargo trams distributing from four peripheral \"cross docks\" to 15 inner-city hubs by 2012. These specially built vehicles would be {{convert|30|ft|m|2}} long with 12 [[axle]]s and a [[Cargo|payload]] of {{convert|30|t|ST LT|1|lk=on}}. On weekdays, trams are planned to make 4 deliveries per hour between 7&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;a.m. and two per hour between 11&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;p.m. With each unloading operation taking on average 10 minutes, this means that each site would be active for 40 minutes out of each hour during the morning rush hour.

Some double-decker trams have open tops. The earliest double-deck trams were horse drawn. The first electric double-deck trams were those built for the Blackpool Tramway in 1885, one of which survives at the [[National Tramway Museum]].\n\nDouble decker trams were commonplace in Great Britain and [[Dublin]] in Ireland before most tramways were torn up in the 1950s and 1960s. New York City's [[New York Railways]] experimented in 1912 with a [[JG Brill Company|Brill]] double deck Hedley-Doyle stepless centre entrance car, nicknamed the \"Broadway Battleship\", a term that spread to other large streetcars.<ref name=\"Bain Smithsonian\">{{cite web|last1=Bain|first1=George|title=New Double-deck Streetcar \u2013 N.Y.|url=http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.10615/|publisher=Bain News Service|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195932/http://loc.gov/pictures/resource/ggbain.10615/|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Hobart]], Tasmania, Australia made extensive use of double decker trams.

This made passenger access easier, reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. These cars were frequently referred to as \"drop-centres\". It is believed that the design first originated in [[Trams in Christchurch|Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1906 when Boon & Co Ltd. built 26 such trams in three series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|title=Tramway Historical Society \u2013 Welcome|website=www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406015134/http://ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|archivedate=6 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A number of these trams have been preserved.

This allows them to load passengers, including those in [[wheelchair]]s or with [[Baby transport|perambulator]]s directly from low-rise platforms that are not much more than raised footpaths/sidewalks. This satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive [[wheelchair lift]]s, while at the same time making boarding faster and easier for other passengers. Passengers appreciate the ease of boarding and alighting from low-floor trams and moving about inside 100 per cent low-floor trams. Passenger satisfaction with low-floor trams is high.<ref name=Yarra /> In some jurisdictions this has even been made mandatory since the 1990s, for example by [[Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate]] in Britain and the [[Disability Discrimination Act]] in the United Kingdom and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.\n\nVarious companies have developed particular low-floor designs, varying from part-low-floor (with internal steps between the low-floor section and the high-floor sections over the bogies), e.g. Citytram<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trampower.co.uk |title=TRAM Power home &#124; City Class Tram and LR55 rail system |publisher=Trampower.co.uk |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215222250/http://www.trampower.co.uk/ |archivedate=15 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[Siemens S70]], to 100 per cent low-floor, where the floor passes through a corridor between the drive wheels, thus maintaining a relatively constant (stepless) level from end to end of the tram.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the [[\u0160koda 15 T|\u0160koda ForCity]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, that carried the mechanical penalty of requiring bogies to be fixed and unable to pivot (except for less than 5 degrees in some trams) and thus reducing [[Minimum railway curve radius|curve negotiation]].

In contrast to other low-floor trams, the floor in the interior of ULF is at sidewalk height (about 18&nbsp;cm or 7&nbsp;inches above the road surface), which makes access to trams easy for passengers in wheelchairs or with baby carriages. This configuration required a new undercarriage. The axles had to be replaced by a complicated electronic steering of the [[traction motor]]s. Auxiliary devices are installed largely under the car's roof.\n\nMost low-floor trams carry the mechanical penalty of requiring [[bogie]]s to be fixed and unable to pivot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webak.upce.cz/~lata/konference/sbornik-clanky/79_86_zelingr_heptner.pdf |title=Zelingr, Heptner |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This creates undue wear on the tracks and wheels and reduces the speed at which a tram can drive through a curve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170646/http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-18 |title=\u010cVUT.cz \u2013 \u010capek, Kol\u00e1\u0159 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}</ref> Some manufacturers such as [[Citadis]] deal with the issue by introducing partially high floor trams.

Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of [[railroad switch|crossover points]] or Y-points.\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Prague Tram (8353420504).jpg\n | width1 = 167\n | caption1 = [[Uni-directional vehicle|Single-ended]] tram\n | footer= Trams are typically designed as uni-directional single-ended vehicles, or double-ended vehicles capable of being driven in both directions.\n | image2 = Pesa Jazz Plac Wile\u0144ski w Warszawie.JPG\n | caption2 = Double-ended tram\n | width2 = 200\n}}\nConversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at termini so that the operator's cab is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.\n\nA single-ended tram has operator's controls at only one end, and can safely be driven at speed in the forward direction but is also capable of reverse movement, typically at slower speed, using a small set of controls at the rear. The configuration of the doors is usually asymmetrical, favouring the side expected to be closest to the street [[kerb]] and [[footpath]]. At the end of a run, the tram must be turned around via a [[balloon loop]] or some other method, to face in the opposite direction for a return trip.\n\nIn addition, if overhead electrical power is fed from a [[trolley pole]], the direction of the trolley pole must be reversed at the end of the run, to ensure that the pole is \"pulled\" behind or \"trailing\" the vehicle, to avoid 'dewiring'. This was achieved by a member of the crew swinging the pole through 180 degrees (if there was only one pole) or lowering one pole and raising the other if there were two. More commonly nowadays, a bidirectional [[pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] may be used to feed power, eliminating the need for an extra procedure when reversing direction.\n\nTwo single-ended trams with doors on both sides may be coupled into a (semi-)permanently coupled [[married pair]] or [[Twin unit|twinset]], with operator's controls at each end of the combination. Such a setup is operated as if it were a double-ended tram, except that the operator must exit one vehicle and enter the other, when reversing at the end of the run.\n\n===Tourist tram===\n{{main|Heritage streetcar}}\n[[File:Port de soller to soller tram arp.jpg|thumb|left|A [[heritage streetcar|heritage tram]] operated by [[Tranv\u00eda de S\u00f3ller]]. Heritage trams are operated in an effort to draw tourists and tram enthusiasts.]]\nMany systems have retained historical trams which will often run over parts of the system for tourists and tram enthusiasts.\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, a number of the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W class]] run throughout each day in a set route which circles the Central Business District. They are primarily for the use of tourists, although often also used by regular commuters.\n\n===Tram-train===\n{{Main|Tram-train}}\n\nA [[tram-train]] is a [[Light rail|light-rail]] [[public transport]] system where trams run through from an urban tramway network to main-line [[railway]] lines which are shared with conventional trains. This allows passengers to travel from suburban areas into city-centre destinations without having to change from a train to a tram.\n\nTram-train operation uses vehicles such as the [[Flexity Link]] and Regio-[[Alstom Citadis]], which are suited for use on urban tram lines and also meet the necessary indication, power, and strength requirements for operation on main-line railways.\n\nIt has been primarily developed in Germanic countries, in particular Germany and Switzerland. [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn|Karlsruhe]] is a notable pioneer of the tram-train.\n\n===Contractors' mobile office===\nTwo former passenger cars from the [[Melbourne]] system were converted and used as mobile offices within the [[Preston Workshops]] between 1969 and 1974, by personnel from [[Commonwealth Engineering]] and [[Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]] who were connected with the construction of Melbourne's Z Class cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===Rubber-tyred tram===\n{{See also|Rubber-tyred tram}}\n[[File:Tram roue.jpg|thumb|upright|Rubber tyres used for the [[Translohr]] [[rubber-tyred trams]]. Rubber-tyred trams are trams that are guided by fixed rail, but also make use of rubber tyres.]]\nA rubber-tyred tram is a [[guided bus]] which is guided by a fixed rail on the ground and uses overhead cables like a conventional tram. This can allow the vehicles to match the capacity of conventional trams and cope with gradients up to 13% due to the rubber tyres. There are two systems which use this technology: the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit (GLT)]] and [[Translohr]]. The GLT \"trams\" are legally considered buses as they have steering wheels and can leave the fixed rail when requirements dictate e.g. when journeying to a depot while a Translohr \"tram\" cannot operate without a guidance rail and are generally not considered buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymtram.mashke.org/france/nancy/translohr_glt_en.html|title=Retrieved 21 September 2013.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWith the development of technologies for self-guided vehicles, it is now possible to dispense with the guide rail.  The [[Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit]] system planned for Zouzhou in China follows a virtual track.\n\n===Other designs===\n====Modern styling====\nThe ''[[Eurotram]]'' series was developed by [[Socimi]] of Italy. It is used by [[Strasbourg]], [[Milan]], and [[Porto]]. The Eurotram has a modern design that makes it look almost as much like a train as a tram, and has large windows along its entire length.<ref>[http://world.nycsubway.org/eu/pt/portometro.html Porto:Metro from NYCsubway.org].

Overhead wires are used for both trams and light rail systems.]]\nThere are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating in mixed traffic, and the later type which is most often associated with the tram system having its own right of way. Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called [[light rail]] but this does not always hold true. Though these two systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the same.\n\n===Controls===\nTrams were traditionally operated with separate levers for applying power and brakes. More modern vehicles use a [[locomotive]]-style controller which incorporate a [[dead man's switch]]. The success of the [[PCC streetcar]] had also seen trams use automobile-style [[Automobile pedal|foot controls]] allowing hands-free operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare collection.\n\n===Power supply===\nElectric trams use various devices to collect power from [[overhead line]]s. The most common device found today is the [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while some older systems use [[trolley pole]]s or [[bow collector]]s. [[Ground-level power supply]] has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses [[supercapacitor]]s; when an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large [[capacitor]] to drive the tram past the gap in the power feed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/lc/capac1.htm |title=An Introduction To Capacitors |publisher=Facstaff.bucknell.edu |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023326/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/LC/Capac1.htm |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A rather obsolete system for power supply is [[conduit current collection]].\n\nThe old tram systems in London, [[Manhattan]] (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a [[plough]]. It was called [[Conduit current collection]]. Washington's was the last of these to close, in 1962. Today, no commercial tramway uses this system. More recently, a modern equivalent to these systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a [[third rail]] on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or [[ground-level power supply]]; the main example of this is the new tramway in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n====Ground-level power supply====\n{{Main|Ground-level power supply}}\n[[File:Bordeaux-aps+isolation&joint.jpg|thumb|A section of [[Ground-level power supply|APS]] track in [[Bordeaux]] with powered and neutral sections.]]\nA ground-level power supply system also known as Surface current collection or Alimentation par le sol (APS) is an updated version of the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.\n\nOlder systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Wireless and solid state switching remove the mechanical problem.\n\nAlstom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of old [[Bordeaux]].<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature1096/ Allez le Tram from Railway-Technology.com]. Retrieved 15 February 2009.</ref>\n\n===Route===\nRoute patterns vary greatly among the world's tram systems, leading to different [[network topologies]]. \n* Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with residential suburbs and traffic hubs such as railway stations and hospitals, usually following main roads. Some of these, such as those in [[Hong Kong Tramways|Hong Kong]], [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]], [[Trams in Ulm|Ulm]] and [[Bergen Light Rail|Bergen]], still essentially comprise a single route. Some suburbs may be served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads. Some modern systems have started by reusing existing radial railway tracks, as in [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] and [[Midland Metro|Birmingham]], sometimes [[Cross-city route|joining them together]] by a section of street track through the city centre, as in [[Manchester Metrolink|Manchester]]. Later developments often include tangential routes linking adjacent suburbs directly, or multiple routes through the town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester's [[Manchester Metrolink#Lines|Second City Crossing]].\n* Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which already have well-developed metro and suburban railway systems, such as [[Tramlink|London]] and [[Tramways in \u00cele-de-France|Paris]], have started by building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations. In Paris these have then been linked by [[Circle route|ring lines]].\n* A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by [[BOGESTRA]] or the [[Silesian Interurbans]].\n* A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a [[downtown circulator]], as in [[Portland Streetcar|Portland]] or [[El Paso Streetcar|El Paso]].\n* Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in [[Trams in Stockholm|Stockholm]].\n\nThe resulting route patterns are very different. Some have a rational structure, covering their catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral to their layout \u2013 such is the case in [[Trams in Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]. [[Bordeaux Tramway|Bordeaux]] and [[Montpellier tramway|Montpellier]] have built comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interconnections, within the last two decades. Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin]] being the prime example, owing to the fact that trams survived the city's political division only in the Eastern part. Other systems have ended up with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have ceased operation (as with the ''tramways vicinaux/buurtspoorwegen'' in [[Trams in Brussels|Brussels]]) or where isolated outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin). In [[Trams in Rome|Rome]], the remnant of the system comprises 3 isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linked by a ring route. Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than continue operating an existing one.\n\nIn some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case in Leipzigerstra\u00dfe in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.\n\nTram systems operate across national borders in [[Trams in Basel#Cross-border routes|Basel]] (from Switzerland into France and Germany) and [[Strasbourg tramway#Future extensions|Strasbourg]] (From France into Germany). It is planned to open a [[Hasselt \u2013 Maastricht tramway|line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands)]] in 2021.\n\n===Track===\n{{Main|Tramway track}}\n[[File:Szyny G\u0142ogowska RB2.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Rail profile#Grooved rail|Cross section]] of a grooved tram rail.]]\nTramway track can have different [[rail profile]]s to accommodate the various operating environments of the vehicle. They may be embedded into [[concrete]] for street-running operation, or use standard [[ballast]]ed track with [[railroad tie]]s on high-speed sections. A more ecological solution is to embed tracks into [[sod|grass turf]].\n\nTramway tracks use a [[Rail profile#Grooved rail|grooved rail]] with a [[groove (engineering)|groove]] designed for tramway or railway track in [[Road surface|pavement]] or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by [[Alphonse Loubat]], a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.  The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.  The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \"scrubber\" tram.  Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.\n\nIn narrow situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid [[railroad switch|switches]], have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in [[Amsterdam]] on three short stretches (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024231501/http://adres.asp4all.nl/asp/get.asp?map_width=474&map_height=396&view=&laag=AmsterdamLite_Alleen_Kaart.mwf&xdl=Stadsplattegrond&xsl=Layout&straat=DAM&huisnummer=1&postcode_n=1012&postcode_a=JS&x_coord=121399&y_coord=487379&panning=true&point=&minx=120658.02971199994&maxx=120741.37028799993&miny=486378.4868480003&maxy=486448.11315200035&zoom=333 map detail]); this is known as interlaced or [[gauntlet track]]. There is a UK example of interlaced track on the [[Tramlink]], just west of Mitcham Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an obstruction. (See photo in [[Tramlink]] entry).\n\n===Track gauge===\nHistorically, the [[track gauge]] has had considerable variations, with [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now [[standard gauge]]. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.\n\nAnother factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout. Standard gauge also enables \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 a larger choice of manufacturers and thus lower procurement costs for new vehicles. However, other factors such as electrification or [[loading gauge]] for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.\n\n===Tram stop===\n{{Main|Tram stop}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Tram lyon 04.jpg\n | width1 = 200\n | footer= Tram stops can range from purpose-built, tram-exclusive facilities (left), to simple stops within a public road (right).\n | image2 = Stra\u00dfenbahnlinie 14, Oppenheimer Landstra\u00dfe.jpg\n | width2 = 180\n}}\nTram stops may be similar to [[bus stop]]s in design and use, particularly in street-running sections, where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors. Some stops may resemble to [[railway platform]]s, particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are boarded at standard [[railway platform height]], as opposed to using steps at the doorway or [[low-floor tram]]s.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nApproximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year.

This is especially compared to internal combustion buses, which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the vibrations of the engine.\n* In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than similar buses. This has been cited as a reason for the replacement of one of Europe's busiest bus lines (with three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe]].\n* Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than subways or other forms of [[heavy rail]]. In Berlin the commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs as much as ten kilometers of tramway.\n* Tramways can take advantage of old [[heavy rail]] alignments some examples include the [[Manchester Metrolink]] of which the [[Bury Line]] was part of the [[East Lancashire Railway]]. Other examples can be found in [[London]], [[Boston]], [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. They hence sometimes take advantage of high speed track while on train tracks.\n* Passengers can reach surface stations quicker than underground stations. Subjective safety at surface stations is often seen to be higher.\n* Trams can be tourist attractions in ways buses usually aren't.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n[[File:Midland Metro - Cyclist dismount sign - Andy Mabbett.jpg|thumb|A sign advising cyclists to dismount due to tram tracks.

The [[Toronto streetcar system]] had similarly become an iconic symbol of the city, operating the largest network in the Americas as well as the only large-scale tram system in Canada (not including light rail systems, or heritage lines).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/14/streetcars-are-our-neglected-stars-keenan.html|title=Streetcars are our neglected stars|work=The Toronto Star|last=Keenan|first=Edward|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Torstar Corporation|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915120009/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/14/streetcars-are-our-neglected-stars-keenan.html|archivedate=15 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/01/toronto_rides_new_streetcars_to_its_urban_future_hume.html|title=Toronto rides new streetcars to its urban future|work=The Toronto Star|first=Christopher|last=Hume|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Torstar Corporation|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909021538/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/01/toronto_rides_new_streetcars_to_its_urban_future_hume.html|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Major tram and light rail systems===\n{{main|List of largest town tramway systems}}\n====Current systems====\n[[File:Melbourne tram extension proposals.gif|thumb|Map of Melbourne's tram system in 2009 (with proposed extension).

However, a new tram system is in the process of being brought to Colombo as part of the plan of [[Western Region Megapolis]].\n\nOther countries with discontinued tram systems include Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan and Vietnam. However, a tram system is planned for construction in [[Gwadar]], Pakistan where construction started in late 2011. Trams are also under construction in [[DHA City, Karachi]]. In China the cities of Beijing, Zhuhai, Nanjing and Shenzhen are planning tram networks for the future.\n\n\n[Historic]\n\nIndonesia\n\nIn Batavia (now Jakarta), the capital of the former Dutch colony of the Netherlands East Indies, a horse tram service started in 1869. A steam tram ran from 1881, and electrification followed in 1897. All Jakarta trams were discontinued in the 1960 by an independent Indonesia due to pressure from Sukarno which saw tram network as \"antiquated\" and \"relic of colonial era\".\nThe other cities in Indonesia who used to have urban tram network were Surabaya and Semarang.\n\nSemarang tram network was constructed between 1882 and 1883, and it was essentially the inner suburb extension of Samarang Joana Railway (SJS) network, where they already had extensive rural tram network to the east of Semarang. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties that hampered SJS railway company, Semarang tram network was closed down in 1940 (despite public protest in Semarang) and their rolling stocks were transferred to Surabaya tram network.\n\nSurabaya tram network was first built in 1886. Initially consist of steam tram only, but later another network of electric tram was added in 1923. They served Surabaya commuters well into the independence era. The electric tram bowed out from service in 1968, while its steam counterpart outlived the electrics before bowed out from service in 1978, making it as the very last urban steam tram service in the world to see service.\n\nIn 2012 there is a talk of reviving Surabaya's tram network as a part of Surabaya Mass Rapid Transit project, which will see parts of the old electric tram right of way reactivated, and it will be combined with the future monorail network. The project is aimed to alleviate Surabaya's traffic congestion and provide cheap public transportation for Surabaya commuters. As in 2014 the project have entered tender phase.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Trams in Europe}}\n[[File:Chlodwigplatz Stadtbahnhaltestelle 2.jpg|thumb|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] is the largest tram network in the [[European Union]].]]\nIn many European cities much tramway infrastructure was lost in the mid-20th century, though not always on the same scale as in other parts of the world such as North America.

The streetcar system was established in 1861, and used a variety of vehicles in its history, including horse-drawn streetcars, [[Peter Witt streetcar]]s, the PCC streetcar, and the [[Canadian Light Rail Vehicle]] and its articulated counterpart, the [[Articulated Light Rail Vehicle]].

However, Canadian cities excluding Toronto, removed their streetcar systems in the mid-20th century. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, light rail systems were introduced in Calgary and Edmonton; with another light rail system established in Ottawa in 2001. In the late 20th century, several Canadian locales restored portions of their defunct streetcar lines, operating them as a heritage feature for tourists. Heritage streetcar lines in Canada include the [[High Level Bridge Streetcar]] in Edmonton, the [[Nelson Electric Tramway]] in [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], and the [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] in [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]\n[[File:Portland Streetcar B-Loop car on Broadway Bridge (2016).jpg|thumb|left|Opened in 2001, the [[Portland Streetcar]] was the first (non-heritage) tram network established in North America in decades.]]\nPittsburgh had kept most of its streetcar system serving the city and many suburbs, making it the longest-lasting large-network streetcar system in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, most of Pittsburgh's surviving streetcar lines were converted to light rail in the 1980s. San Francisco's [[Muni Metro]] system is the largest surviving streetcar system in the United States, and has even revived previously closed streetcar lines such as the [[F Market & Wharves]] heritage streetcar line. In the late 20th century, several cities installed modern light rail systems, in part along the same corridors as their old streetcars systems, the first of these being the [[San Diego Trolley]] in [[San Diego]] in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, some cities in the United States brought back streetcars lines, including [[MATA Trolley|Memphis]], [[TECO Line Streetcar System|Tampa]], and [[Metro Streetcar|Little Rock]]; However, these streetcar systems were designed as heritage streetcar lines, and used vintage or replica-vintage vehicles.

Sydney reintroduced tram services in 1997 on a modern [[Light rail in Sydney|light rail network]], while Ballarat and Bendigo retained their trams as heritage systems. In 2008 and 2009, Bendigo trialled using its heritage trams for regular public transport. [[Portland, Victoria]], introduced a tourist tram line in 1996, which uses two replicas of a Melbourne cable car dummy or [[cable grip|grip car]], driven by a hidden diesel motor, and two restored trailer cars. A completely new public transport system opened on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] on 20 July 2014, with a major extension completed in December 2017. The new system is known as the [[G:link]] and is the first tram/ light rail system in the state of Queensland since Brisbane closed its tram network in 1969.\n[[File:Canberra Light Rail construction in Harrison 2.jpg|left|thumb|Construction of [[light rail in Canberra]].

The local police did not recognise the ticket but images in newspapers led to it being identified as a Melbourne tram ticket. Serendipitously, the serial number on the ticket was intact. Victoria Police in Melbourne, acting as agents for The Met in London, contacted the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board. From the serial number, the M&MTB were able to tell which tram depot had issued the ticket, on what day and on which specific tram, and in which section of a particular route (North Balwyn). Police then interviewed regular commuters and discovered the identity of a man whom, they believed, had recently travelled to London. This led to the arrest and conviction of the murderer.

Note how the tram's efficiency surprises the European visitor; how two \"remarkably small\" horses sufficed to draw the \"huge\" tramcar.\n\n* Joseph Conrad described Amsterdam's trams in chapter 14 of ''The Mirror of the Sea'' (1906): \"From afar at the end of Tsar Peter Straat, issued in the frosty air the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars, appearing and disappearing in the opening between the buildings, like little toy carriages harnessed with toy horses and played with by people that appeared no bigger than children.\"\n* In episode 6 (\"[[Hades]]\") of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1918), the party on the way to Paddy Dignam's funeral in a horse-drawn carriage idly debates the merits of various tramway improvements:\n{{quote|\nI can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.\n\nInstead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite so. They ought to.\n\nYes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought is to have [[Tram#Hearse trams|municipal funeral trams]] like they have in Milan, you know.

Historically the term '''electric street railways''' was also used in the United States. In the United States, the term ''tram'' has sometimes been used for rubber-tired [[trackless train]]s, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.\n\nTram vehicles are usually lighter and shorter than [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and [[rapid transit]] trains. Today, most trams use electrical power, usually fed by a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] sliding on an [[overhead line]]; older systems may use a [[trolley pole]] or a [[bow collector]]. In some cases, a [[contact shoe]] on a [[third rail]] is used. If necessary, they may have dual power systems\u2014electricity in city streets and diesel in more rural environments. Occasionally, trams also carry [[freight (rail)|freight]].\n\nTrams are now commonly included in the wider term \"[[light rail]]\",<ref>Collins English Dictionary \u2013 Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014 \u00a9 HarperCollins Publishers 1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2014</ref> which also includes [[grade-separated]] systems. Some trams, known as [[tram-train]]s, may have segments that run on mainline railway tracks, similar to [[interurban]] systems. The differences between these modes of rail transport are often indistinct and a given system may combine multiple features.\n\nOne of the advantages over earlier forms of transit was the low [[rolling resistance]] of metal wheels on [[steel]] rails, allowing the trams to haul a greater load for a given effort. Problems included the high [[total cost of ownership]] of horses. Electric trams largely replaced animal power in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Improvements in other vehicles such as buses led to decline of trams in the mid 20th century. However, trams have seen resurgence in recent years.\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\nThe English terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' are derived from the [[Scots language|Scots]] word {{lang|sco|tram}},<ref>{{cite web|url = https://dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/tram_n_2 |title = tram, n.<sup>2</sup> |work = A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (up to 1700)|publisher = Dictionary of the Scots Language}}</ref> referring respectively to a type of truck ([[goods wagon]] or freight [[railroad car]]) used in [[coal mining|coal mines]] and the tracks on which they ran. The word ''tram'' probably derived from [[Middle Dutch|Middle Flemish]] {{lang |dum|trame}} (\"beam, handle of a barrow, bar, rung\"). The identical word {{lang|fr|la trame}} with the meaning \"crossbeam\" is also used in the [[French language]]. Etymologists believe that the word ''tram'' refers to the wooden beams the railway tracks were initially made of before the railroad pioneers switched to the much more wear-resistant tracks made of iron and, later, steel.<ref>Duden-das Herkunftsw\u00f6rterbuch-Etymologie der deutschen Sprache-Mannheim 2001 p859</ref> The word ''Tram-car'' is attested from 1873.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tram |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150510061427/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tram |archivedate=10 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Go by Streetcar sign - Portland Oregon.jpg|thumb|A sign in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] that reads \"go by streetcar.\" Trams are typically called streetcars in North America.]]\nAlthough the terms ''tram'' and ''tramway'' have been adopted by many languages, they are not used universally in English; North Americans prefer ''streetcar'', ''trolley'', or ''trolleycar''. The term ''streetcar'' is first recorded in 1840, and originally referred to [[horsecar]]s. When electrification came, Americans began to speak of ''trolleycars'' or later, ''trolleys''. A widely held belief holds the word to derive from the ''troller'' (said to derive from the words ''traveler'' and ''roller''), a four-wheeled device that was dragged along dual overhead wires by a cable that connected the troller to the top of the car and collected electrical power from the [[overhead wire]]s;<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

Middleton|Middleton, William D.]] (1967). ''The Time of the Trolley'', p. 60. Milwaukee: Kalmbach Publishing. {{ISBN|0-89024-013-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe alternative North American term 'trolley' may strictly speaking be considered incorrect, as the term can also be applied to cable cars, or [[conduit car]]s that instead draw power from an underground supply. Conventional diesel [[bus|tourist buses]] decorated to look like streetcars are sometimes called ''trolleys'' in the US ([[tourist trolley]]). Furthering confusion, the term ''tram'' has instead been applied to open-sided, low-speed [[trackless train|segmented vehicles on rubber tires]] generally used to ferry tourists short distances, for example on the [[Universal Studios Backlot Tour|Universal Studios backlot tour]] and, in many countries, as tourist transport to major destinations. The term may also apply to an aerial ropeway, e.g. the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]].\n\nAlthough the use of the term ''trolley'' for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later associated with the ''[[trolleybus]]'', a rubber-tyred vehicle running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called ''trackless trolleys'' (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply ''trolleys'' (in the UK, as well as the [[Pacific Northwest]], including [[Seattle]], and [[Vancouver]]).\n\nThe [[New South Wales]] government in Australia has decided to use the term \"light rail\" for their trams.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of trams}}\n\nThe history of trams, streetcars or trolley systems, began in the early nineteenth century. It can be divided up into several discrete periods defined by the principal means of motive power used.\n\n===Horse-drawn===\n{{Main|Horsecar}}\n[[File:Horsetrain 1870.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn tram operated by [[Swansea and Mumbles Railway]], 1870.

Running the horsecars on rails allowed for a much smoother ride. There are records of a street railway running in [[Baltimore]] as early as 1828, however the first authenticated streetcar in America, was the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] developed by the Irish coach builder [[John Stephenson (coachbuilder)|John Stephenson]], in New York City which began service in the year 1832.{{sfn|Dunbar|1967|pp=16\u201317}}<ref>[http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/stephenson1.htm The John Stephenson Car Co].

The first trams in Australia opened in 1860 in [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney]]. Africa's first tram service started in [[Trams in Alexandria|Alexandria]] on 8 January 1863. The first trams in Asia opened in 1869 in [[Trams in Asia|Batavia (now Jakarta), Netherlands East Indies (now Indonesia)]].\n\nProblems with horsecars included the fact that any given animal could only work so many hours on a given day, had to be housed, groomed, fed and cared for day in and day out, and produced prodigious amounts of manure, which the streetcar company was charged with storing and then disposing of. Since a typical horse pulled a streetcar for about a dozen miles a day and worked for four or five hours, many systems needed ten or more horses in stable for each horsecar.\n\nHorsecars were largely replaced by electric-powered trams following the improvement of an overhead trolley system on trams for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by [[Frank J. Sprague]]. His spring-loaded [[trolley pole]] used a wheel to travel along the wire. In late 1887 and early 1888, using his trolley system, Sprague installed the first successful large electric street railway system in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. Within a year, the economy of electric power had replaced more costly horsecars in many cities. By 1889, 110 electric railways incorporating Sprague's equipment had been begun or planned on several continents.<ref name=\"siemens.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|title=Transportation Technology|website=www.siemens.com|access-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729124510/https://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm|archive-date=29 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:The last of the Horse Drawn Carriages.JPG|thumb|Horse-drawn trams continued to be used in [[New York City]] until 1917.]]\nHorses continued to be used for light shunting well into the 20th century, and many large metropolitan lines lasted into the early 20th century.

The most notable system to adopt such trams was in Paris. French-designed steam trams also operated in [[Trams in Rockhampton|Rockhampton]], in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] between 1909 and 1939. [[Stockholm]], Sweden, had a steam tram line at the island of [[S\u00f6dermalm]] between 1887 and 1901.\n\nTram engines usually had modifications to make them suitable for street running in residential areas. The wheels, and other moving parts of the machinery, were usually enclosed for safety reasons and to make the engines quieter. Measures were often taken to prevent the engines from emitting visible smoke or steam. Usually the engines used [[coke (fuel)|coke]] rather than coal as fuel to avoid emitting smoke; [[Condensing steam locomotive|condensers]] or [[Superheater|superheating]] were used to avoid emitting visible steam. A major drawback of this style of tram was the limited space for the engine, so that these trams were usually underpowered. Steam tram engines faded out around the 1890s to 1900s, being replaced by electric trams.\n\n===Cable-hauled===\n{{Main|Cable car (railway)}}\n[[File:Minories stationLBR.jpg|thumb|Winding drums of the [[London and Blackwall Railway|London and Blackwall]] cable-operated railway]]\nAnother motive system for trams was the cable car, which was pulled along a [[rail track|fixed track]] by a moving steel cable. The power to move the cable was normally provided at a \"powerhouse\" site a distance away from the actual vehicle. The [[London and Blackwall Railway]], which opened for passengers in east London, England, in 1840 used such a system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Andrew|date=March 1848|title=Blackwall Railway Machinery|journal=The Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal|publisher=Wiley & Putnam|location=New York|volume=11}}</ref>\n\nThe first practical cable car line was tested in [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]], in 1873. Part of its success is attributed to the development of an effective and reliable [[cable grip]] mechanism, to grab and release the moving cable without damage. The second city to operate cable trams was [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Dunedin]] in New Zealand, from 1881 to 1957.\n\nThe most extensive cable system in the US was built in [[Cable cars in Chicago|Chicago]], having been built in stages between 1859 and 1892. New York City developed multiple cable car lines, that operated from 1883 to 1909.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bowery boys : adventures In Old New York : an unconventional exploration of Manhattan's historic neighborhoods, secret spots and colorful characters |publisher=Ulysses Press |isbn=1612435769 |page=179 |date=18 April 2016 }}</ref> Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898.\n[[File:Melbourne\u2019s first cable tram.jpg|thumb|The first [[Melbourne cable tramway system|cable car service in Melbourne]], 1885. From its founding to 1940, Melbourne operated one of the largest cable car networks in the world.]]\nFrom 1885 to 1940, the city of [[Melbourne cable tramway system|Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia operated one of the largest cable systems in the world, at its peak running 592 trams on {{convert|75|km|mi}} of track. There were also two isolated cable lines in [[Sydney]], New South Wales, Australia; the North Sydney line from 1886 to 1900,<ref>[[Trams in Sydney]]</ref> and the King Street line from 1892 to 1905.\n\nIn [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1901 an elevated [[suspension railway|suspended]] cable car following the ''Eugen Langen one-railed floating tram system'' started operating. Cable cars operated on [[Highgate Hill]] in North London and [[Kennington]] to [[Brixton]] Hill In South London.{{when|date=March 2013}} They also worked around \"Upper Douglas\" in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1897 to 1929 (cable car 72/73 is the sole survivor of the fleet).\n\nCable cars suffered from high [[infrastructure]] costs, since an expensive system of [[Wire rope|cables]], [[pulley]]s, [[stationary engine]]s and lengthy underground vault structures beneath the rails had to be provided. They also required physical strength and skill to operate, and alert operators to avoid obstructions and other cable cars. The cable had to be disconnected (\"dropped\") at designated locations to allow the cars to coast by inertia, for example when crossing another cable line. The cable would then have to be \"picked up\" to resume progress, the whole operation requiring precise timing to avoid damage to the cable and the grip mechanism. Breaks and frays in the cable, which occurred frequently, required the complete cessation of services over a cable route while the cable was repaired. Due to overall wear, the entire length of cable (typically several kilometres) would have to be replaced on a regular schedule. After the development of reliable electrically powered trams, the costly high-maintenance cable car systems were rapidly replaced in most locations.\n[[File:San Francisco Cable Car MC.jpg|thumb|left|A [[San Francisco cable cars|San Francisco cable car]] in 2008. The cable car's effectiveness in hilly environments partially explains its continued use in San Francisco.]]\nCable cars remained especially effective in hilly cities, since their nondriven wheels would not [[rail adhesion|lose traction]] as they climbed or descended a steep hill. The moving cable would physically pull the car up the hill at a steady pace, unlike a low-powered steam or horse-drawn car. Cable cars do have wheel brakes and [[track brake]]s, but the cable also helps restrain the car to going downhill at a constant speed. Performance in steep terrain partially explains the survival of cable cars in San Francisco.\n\nThe [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco cable cars]], though significantly reduced in number, continue to perform a regular transportation function, in addition to being a well-known [[tourist attraction]]. A single cable line also survives in [[Wellington]], New Zealand (rebuilt in 1979 as a [[funicular]] but still called the \"[[Wellington Cable Car]]\"). Another system, actually two separate cable lines with a shared power station in the middle, operates from the Welsh town of [[Llandudno]] up to the top of the [[Great Orme]] hill in [[North Wales]], UK.\n\n===Gas===\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries a number of systems in various parts of the world employed trams powered by gas, [[naphtha]] gas or [[coal gas]] in particular. Gas trams are known to have operated between [[Alphington, Victoria|Alphington]] and [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]] in the northern suburbs of [[Melbourne]], Australia (1886\u20131888); in Berlin and [[Dresden]], Germany; in [[Estonia]] (1921\u20131951); between [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra|Cieplice]], and [[Sobiesz\u00f3w]] in Poland (from 1897); and in the UK at [[Lytham St Annes]], [[Neath]] (1896\u20131920), and [[Trafford Park]], Manchester (1897\u20131908).\n\nOn 29 December 1886 the Melbourne newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' reprinted a report from the [[San Francisco Bulletin]] that Mr Noble had demonstrated a new 'motor car' for tramways 'with success'. The tramcar 'exactly similar in size, shape, and capacity to a cable grip car' had the 'motive power' of gas 'with which the reservoir is to be charged once a day at power stations by means of a rubber hose'. The car also carried an electricity generator for 'lighting up the tram and also for driving the engine on steep grades and effecting a start'.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11584473 |title=WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1886. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=29 December 1886 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nComparatively little has been published about gas trams.

This gave rise to the modern subway train. Following the improvement of an overhead \"trolley\" system on streetcars for collecting electricity from [[overhead wire]]s by Sprague, electric tram systems were rapidly adopted across the world.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nEarlier installations proved difficult or unreliable.

Derailed electric trams are a hazard, as it requires contact with the rails for the current's return path.]]\nThere is one particular hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley pole off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on contact with the rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as interior lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts DC. In British terminology, such a tram was said to be \u2018grounded\u2019\u2014not to be confused with the US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth return circuit and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event, the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley pole, before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram, the water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.{{citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nIn the 2000s, two companies introduced catenary-free designs.

The [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] was a case study of the decline of trams in the United States. In the 21st century, trams have been re-introduced in cities where they had been closed down for decades (such as [[Tramlink]] in London), or kept in heritage use (such as [[Sp\u00e5rv\u00e4g City]] in Stockholm).

The motivation now is to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and damage to road surfaces in city centres.\n\nOne recent proposal to bring cargo tramways back into wider use was the plan by [[City Cargo Amsterdam]] to reintroduce them into the city of [[Amsterdam]]. In the spring of 2007 the city piloted this cargo tram operation, which among its aims aimed to reduce [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] pollution in the city by 20% by halving the number of [[lorries]] (5,000) unloading in the [[inner city]] during the permitted timeframe from 07:00 till 10:30. The pilot involved two cargo trams, operating from a distribution centre and delivering to a \"hub\" where special electric trucks delivered the trams' small [[Shipping container|containers]] to their final destination. The trial was successful, releasing an intended investment of \u20ac100&nbsp;million in a [[Fleet vehicles|fleet]] of 52 cargo trams distributing from four peripheral \"cross docks\" to 15 inner-city hubs by 2012. These specially built vehicles would be {{convert|30|ft|m|2}} long with 12 [[axle]]s and a [[Cargo|payload]] of {{convert|30|t|ST LT|1|lk=on}}. On weekdays, trams are planned to make 4 deliveries per hour between 7&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;a.m. and two per hour between 11&nbsp;a.m. and 11&nbsp;p.m. With each unloading operation taking on average 10 minutes, this means that each site would be active for 40 minutes out of each hour during the morning rush hour. In early 2009 the scheme was suspended owing to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|financial crisis]] impeding fund-raising.<ref>\"Samenwest\"  ''5 December 2006, NOS3 television news 7 March 2007, ''Amsterdams Stadblad 4 June 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/delivering-goods-cargo-tram-amsterdam-netherlands|title=Delivering Case studies - Eltis goods by cargo tram in Amsterdam (Netherlands) |website=www.eltis.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820161058/http://www.eltis.org/discover/case-studies/delivering-goods-cargo-tram-amsterdam-netherlands|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Dog car===\nIn 1937, Melbourne passenger tramcar C class number 30 was converted for transporting dogs and their owners to the [[Royal Melbourne Showgrounds]].

This made passenger access easier, reducing the number of steps required to reach the inside of the vehicle. These cars were frequently referred to as \"drop-centres\". It is believed that the design first originated in [[Trams in Christchurch|Christchurch]], New Zealand, in 1906 when Boon & Co Ltd. built 26 such trams in three series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|title=Tramway Historical Society \u2013 Welcome|website=www.ferrymeadtramway.org.nz|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406015134/http://ferrymeadtramway.org.nz/collections/collection.php?cid=6&id=8|archivedate=6 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A number of these trams have been preserved.

This allows them to load passengers, including those in [[wheelchair]]s or with [[Baby transport|perambulator]]s directly from low-rise platforms that are not much more than raised footpaths/sidewalks. This satisfies requirements to provide access to disabled passengers without using expensive [[wheelchair lift]]s, while at the same time making boarding faster and easier for other passengers.

In contrast to other low-floor trams, the floor in the interior of ULF is at sidewalk height (about 18&nbsp;cm or 7&nbsp;inches above the road surface), which makes access to trams easy for passengers in wheelchairs or with baby carriages. This configuration required a new undercarriage. The axles had to be replaced by a complicated electronic steering of the [[traction motor]]s.

Three of the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W class trams]] were converted to restaurant tram since 1983. All three often run in tandem and there are usually multiple meal sittings. Bookings often close months in advance. As from mid-October 2018, Melbourne's restaurant trams were temporarily taken off the road after failing a [[Yarra Trams]]' safety assessment due to badly weathered underlying structures. Until the trams again meet safety standards, the trams are offering stationary dining.<ref>''Railway Digest'', journal of the [[Australian Railway Historical Society]], December 2018</ref> As at October 2019, they were still not running.<ref>https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/melbourne-s-famous-tram-restaurant-sues-yarra-trams-20191015-p530za.html</ref>\n\nBistro trams with buffets operated on ordinary services between 1924 and 2014 on the U76 [[Rheinbahn]] route between [[Krefeld]] and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] in Germany,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linied.net/aktuelles_2014/2014_bistro.html|title=Linie D - Aktuelles - Einsatz der Rheinbahn-Speisewagen endet|website=www.linied.net|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> and for a short period in 1911 on the Amsterdam-Zandvoort line.\n\n[[Helsinki]] in Finland has a [[Sp\u00e5rakoff|pub tram]]. [[Frankfurt]], Germany, has a tourist circle line called \"Ebbelwei-Express\", in which the traditional local drink \"Apfelwein\" (locally called \"Ebbelwei\", a type of [[hard cider]]) is served.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sightseeing in Frankfurt with the Ebbelwei-Express |url=http://www.ebbelwei-express.com/html/index_e.html |work=Verkehrsgesellschaft Frankfurt am Main |accessdate=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025000/http://www.ebbelwei-express.com/html/index_e.html |archivedate=11 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Single-ended versus double-ended===\nA double-ended tram has an operator's cab and controls at each end of the vehicle, which allows it to easily be driven at full speed in either direction on a continuous segment of track. Typically at the end of a run, the tram's operator will walk from one end of the tram to the other, and then commence the tram route in the other direction. The tram is usually switched to another track by use of [[railroad switch|crossover points]] or Y-points.\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Prague Tram (8353420504).jpg\n | width1 = 167\n | caption1 = [[Uni-directional vehicle|Single-ended]] tram\n | footer= Trams are typically designed as uni-directional single-ended vehicles, or double-ended vehicles capable of being driven in both directions.\n | image2 = Pesa Jazz Plac Wile\u0144ski w Warszawie.JPG\n | caption2 = Double-ended tram\n | width2 = 200\n}}\nConversely, a single-ended vehicle needs a method of turning at termini so that the operator's cab is in the front of the tram for the reverse journey. This usually necessitates a turning loop or triangle. On the other hand, the single cab and controls and fewer door spaces make the tram lighter, increases passenger accommodation (including many more seats) and effects reductions in equipment, weight, first-cost, maintenance cost, and operating expense.\n\nA single-ended tram has operator's controls at only one end, and can safely be driven at speed in the forward direction but is also capable of reverse movement, typically at slower speed, using a small set of controls at the rear. The configuration of the doors is usually asymmetrical, favouring the side expected to be closest to the street [[kerb]] and [[footpath]]. At the end of a run, the tram must be turned around via a [[balloon loop]] or some other method, to face in the opposite direction for a return trip.\n\nIn addition, if overhead electrical power is fed from a [[trolley pole]], the direction of the trolley pole must be reversed at the end of the run, to ensure that the pole is \"pulled\" behind or \"trailing\" the vehicle, to avoid 'dewiring'. This was achieved by a member of the crew swinging the pole through 180 degrees (if there was only one pole) or lowering one pole and raising the other if there were two. More commonly nowadays, a bidirectional [[pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] may be used to feed power, eliminating the need for an extra procedure when reversing direction.\n\nTwo single-ended trams with doors on both sides may be coupled into a (semi-)permanently coupled [[married pair]] or [[Twin unit|twinset]], with operator's controls at each end of the combination. Such a setup is operated as if it were a double-ended tram, except that the operator must exit one vehicle and enter the other, when reversing at the end of the run.\n\n===Tourist tram===\n{{main|Heritage streetcar}}\n[[File:Port de soller to soller tram arp.jpg|thumb|left|A [[heritage streetcar|heritage tram]] operated by [[Tranv\u00eda de S\u00f3ller]]. Heritage trams are operated in an effort to draw tourists and tram enthusiasts.]]\nMany systems have retained historical trams which will often run over parts of the system for tourists and tram enthusiasts.\n\nIn Melbourne, Australia, a number of the iconic [[W-class Melbourne tram|W class]] run throughout each day in a set route which circles the Central Business District. They are primarily for the use of tourists, although often also used by regular commuters.\n\n===Tram-train===\n{{Main|Tram-train}}\n\nA [[tram-train]] is a [[Light rail|light-rail]] [[public transport]] system where trams run through from an urban tramway network to main-line [[railway]] lines which are shared with conventional trains. This allows passengers to travel from suburban areas into city-centre destinations without having to change from a train to a tram.\n\nTram-train operation uses vehicles such as the [[Flexity Link]] and Regio-[[Alstom Citadis]], which are suited for use on urban tram lines and also meet the necessary indication, power, and strength requirements for operation on main-line railways.\n\nIt has been primarily developed in Germanic countries, in particular Germany and Switzerland. [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn|Karlsruhe]] is a notable pioneer of the tram-train.\n\n===Contractors' mobile office===\nTwo former passenger cars from the [[Melbourne]] system were converted and used as mobile offices within the [[Preston Workshops]] between 1969 and 1974, by personnel from [[Commonwealth Engineering]] and [[Allm\u00e4nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]] who were connected with the construction of Melbourne's Z Class cars.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n===Rubber-tyred tram===\n{{See also|Rubber-tyred tram}}\n[[File:Tram roue.jpg|thumb|upright|Rubber tyres used for the [[Translohr]] [[rubber-tyred trams]]. Rubber-tyred trams are trams that are guided by fixed rail, but also make use of rubber tyres.]]\nA rubber-tyred tram is a [[guided bus]] which is guided by a fixed rail on the ground and uses overhead cables like a conventional tram. This can allow the vehicles to match the capacity of conventional trams and cope with gradients up to 13% due to the rubber tyres. There are two systems which use this technology: the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit (GLT)]] and [[Translohr]]. The GLT \"trams\" are legally considered buses as they have steering wheels and can leave the fixed rail when requirements dictate e.g. when journeying to a depot while a Translohr \"tram\" cannot operate without a guidance rail and are generally not considered buses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymtram.mashke.org/france/nancy/translohr_glt_en.html|title=Retrieved 21 September 2013.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWith the development of technologies for self-guided vehicles, it is now possible to dispense with the guide rail.  The [[Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit]] system planned for Zouzhou in China follows a virtual track.\n\n===Other designs===\n====Modern styling====\nThe ''[[Eurotram]]'' series was developed by [[Socimi]] of Italy. It is used by [[Strasbourg]], [[Milan]], and [[Porto]]. The Eurotram has a modern design that makes it look almost as much like a train as a tram, and has large windows along its entire length.<ref>[http://world.nycsubway.org/eu/pt/portometro.html Porto:Metro from NYCsubway.org].

Overhead wires are used for both trams and light rail systems.]]\nThere are two main types of tramways, the classic tramway built in the early 20th century with the tram system operating in mixed traffic, and the later type which is most often associated with the tram system having its own right of way. Tram systems that have their own right of way are often called [[light rail]] but this does not always hold true. Though these two systems differ in their operation, their equipment is much the same.\n\n===Controls===\nTrams were traditionally operated with separate levers for applying power and brakes. More modern vehicles use a [[locomotive]]-style controller which incorporate a [[dead man's switch]]. The success of the [[PCC streetcar]] had also seen trams use automobile-style [[Automobile pedal|foot controls]] allowing hands-free operation, particularly when the driver was responsible for fare collection.\n\n===Power supply===\nElectric trams use various devices to collect power from [[overhead line]]s. The most common device found today is the [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]], while some older systems use [[trolley pole]]s or [[bow collector]]s. [[Ground-level power supply]] has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses [[supercapacitor]]s; when an [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]] at a track switch cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large [[capacitor]] to drive the tram past the gap in the power feed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/lc/capac1.htm |title=An Introduction To Capacitors |publisher=Facstaff.bucknell.edu |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309023326/http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/mastascu/elessonshtml/LC/Capac1.htm |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A rather obsolete system for power supply is [[conduit current collection]].\n\nThe old tram systems in London, [[Manhattan]] (New York City), and Washington, D.C., used live rails, like those on third-rail electrified railways, but in a conduit underneath the road, from which they drew power through a [[plough]]. It was called [[Conduit current collection]]. Washington's was the last of these to close, in 1962. Today, no commercial tramway uses this system. More recently, a modern equivalent to these systems has been developed which allows for the safe installation of a [[third rail]] on city streets, which is known as surface current collection or [[ground-level power supply]]; the main example of this is the new tramway in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n====Ground-level power supply====\n{{Main|Ground-level power supply}}\n[[File:Bordeaux-aps+isolation&joint.jpg|thumb|A section of [[Ground-level power supply|APS]] track in [[Bordeaux]] with powered and neutral sections.]]\nA ground-level power supply system also known as Surface current collection or Alimentation par le sol (APS) is an updated version of the original stud type system. APS uses a third rail placed between the running rails, divided electrically into eight-metre powered segments with three metre neutral sections between. Each tram has two power collection skates, next to which are antennas that send radio signals to energize the power rail segments as the tram passes over them.\n\nOlder systems required mechanical switching systems which were susceptible to environmental problems. At any one time no more than two consecutive segments under the tram should actually be live. Wireless and solid state switching remove the mechanical problem.\n\nAlstom developed the system primarily to avoid intrusive power supply cables in the sensitive area of the old city of old [[Bordeaux]].<ref>[http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature1096/ Allez le Tram from Railway-Technology.com]. Retrieved 15 February 2009.</ref>\n\n===Route===\nRoute patterns vary greatly among the world's tram systems, leading to different [[network topologies]]. \n* Most systems start by building up a strongly nucleated radial pattern of routes linking the city centre with residential suburbs and traffic hubs such as railway stations and hospitals, usually following main roads. Some of these, such as those in [[Hong Kong Tramways|Hong Kong]], [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]], [[Trams in Ulm|Ulm]] and [[Bergen Light Rail|Bergen]], still essentially comprise a single route. Some suburbs may be served by loop lines connecting two adjacent radial roads. Some modern systems have started by reusing existing radial railway tracks, as in [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] and [[Midland Metro|Birmingham]], sometimes [[Cross-city route|joining them together]] by a section of street track through the city centre, as in [[Manchester Metrolink|Manchester]]. Later developments often include tangential routes linking adjacent suburbs directly, or multiple routes through the town centre to avoid congestion (as in Manchester's [[Manchester Metrolink#Lines|Second City Crossing]].\n* Other new systems, particularly those in large cities which already have well-developed metro and suburban railway systems, such as [[Tramlink|London]] and [[Tramways in \u00cele-de-France|Paris]], have started by building isolated suburban lines feeding into railway or metro stations. In Paris these have then been linked by [[Circle route|ring lines]].\n* A third, weakly nucleated, route pattern may grow up where a number of nearby small settlements are linked, such as in the coal-mining areas served by [[BOGESTRA]] or the [[Silesian Interurbans]].\n* A fourth starting point may be a loop in the city centre, sometimes called a [[downtown circulator]], as in [[Portland Streetcar|Portland]] or [[El Paso Streetcar|El Paso]].\n* Occasionally a modern tramway system may grow from a preserved heritage line, as in [[Trams in Stockholm|Stockholm]].\n\nThe resulting route patterns are very different. Some have a rational structure, covering their catchment area as efficiently as possible, with new suburbs being planned with tramlines integral to their layout \u2013 such is the case in [[Trams in Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]. [[Bordeaux Tramway|Bordeaux]] and [[Montpellier tramway|Montpellier]] have built comprehensive networks, based on radial routes with numerous interconnections, within the last two decades. Some systems serve only parts of their cities, with [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin]] being the prime example, owing to the fact that trams survived the city's political division only in the Eastern part. Other systems have ended up with a rather random route map, for instance when some previous operating companies have ceased operation (as with the ''tramways vicinaux/buurtspoorwegen'' in [[Trams in Brussels|Brussels]]) or where isolated outlying lines have been preserved (as on the eastern fringe of Berlin). In [[Trams in Rome|Rome]], the remnant of the system comprises 3 isolated radial routes, not connecting in the ancient city centre, but linked by a ring route. Some apparently anomalous lines continue in operation where a new line would not on rational grounds be built, because it is much more costly to build a new line than continue operating an existing one.\n\nIn some places, the opportunity is taken when roads are being repaved to lay tramlines (though without erecting overhead cables) even though no service is immediately planned: such is the case in Leipzigerstra\u00dfe in Berlin, the Haarlemmer Houttuinen in Amsterdam, and Botermarkt in Ghent.\n\nTram systems operate across national borders in [[Trams in Basel#Cross-border routes|Basel]] (from Switzerland into France and Germany) and [[Strasbourg tramway#Future extensions|Strasbourg]] (From France into Germany). It is planned to open a [[Hasselt \u2013 Maastricht tramway|line linking Hasselt (Belgium) with Maastricht (Netherlands)]] in 2021.\n\n===Track===\n{{Main|Tramway track}}\n[[File:Szyny G\u0142ogowska RB2.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Rail profile#Grooved rail|Cross section]] of a grooved tram rail.]]\nTramway track can have different [[rail profile]]s to accommodate the various operating environments of the vehicle. They may be embedded into [[concrete]] for street-running operation, or use standard [[ballast]]ed track with [[railroad tie]]s on high-speed sections. A more ecological solution is to embed tracks into [[sod|grass turf]].\n\nTramway tracks use a [[Rail profile#Grooved rail|grooved rail]] with a [[groove (engineering)|groove]] designed for tramway or railway track in [[Road surface|pavement]] or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by [[Alphonse Loubat]], a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris.  The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove.  The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \"scrubber\" tram.  Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing.\n\nIn narrow situations double-track tram lines sometimes reduce to single track, or, to avoid [[railroad switch|switches]], have the tracks interlaced, e.g. in the Leidsestraat in [[Amsterdam]] on three short stretches (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024231501/http://adres.asp4all.nl/asp/get.asp?map_width=474&map_height=396&view=&laag=AmsterdamLite_Alleen_Kaart.mwf&xdl=Stadsplattegrond&xsl=Layout&straat=DAM&huisnummer=1&postcode_n=1012&postcode_a=JS&x_coord=121399&y_coord=487379&panning=true&point=&minx=120658.02971199994&maxx=120741.37028799993&miny=486378.4868480003&maxy=486448.11315200035&zoom=333 map detail]); this is known as interlaced or [[gauntlet track]]. There is a UK example of interlaced track on the [[Tramlink]], just west of Mitcham Station, where the formation is narrowed by an old landslip causing an obstruction. (See photo in [[Tramlink]] entry).\n\n===Track gauge===\nHistorically, the [[track gauge]] has had considerable variations, with [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now [[standard gauge]]. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment can be used on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be delivered and relocated conveniently using freight railways and locomotives.\n\nAnother factor favoring standard gauge is that low-floor vehicles are becoming popular, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow gauge layout. Standard gauge also enables \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 a larger choice of manufacturers and thus lower procurement costs for new vehicles. However, other factors such as electrification or [[loading gauge]] for which there is more variation may require costly custom built units regardless.\n\n===Tram stop===\n{{Main|Tram stop}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Tram lyon 04.jpg\n | width1 = 200\n | footer= Tram stops can range from purpose-built, tram-exclusive facilities (left), to simple stops within a public road (right).\n | image2 = Stra\u00dfenbahnlinie 14, Oppenheimer Landstra\u00dfe.jpg\n | width2 = 180\n}}\nTram stops may be similar to [[bus stop]]s in design and use, particularly in street-running sections, where in some cases other vehicles are legally required to stop clear of the tram doors. Some stops may resemble to [[railway platform]]s, particularly in private right-of-way sections and where trams are boarded at standard [[railway platform height]], as opposed to using steps at the doorway or [[low-floor tram]]s.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nApproximately 5,000 new trams are manufactured each year.

This is especially compared to internal combustion buses, which tend to require high amounts of maintenance and break down after less than 20 years, mostly due to the vibrations of the engine.\n* In many cases tram networks have a higher capacity than similar buses. This has been cited as a reason for the replacement of one of Europe's busiest bus lines (with three-minute headways in peak times) with a tram by [[Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe]].\n* Trams and light rail systems can be cheaper to install than subways or other forms of [[heavy rail]]. In Berlin the commonly cited figure is that one kilometer of subway costs as much as ten kilometers of tramway.\n* Tramways can take advantage of old [[heavy rail]] alignments some examples include the [[Manchester Metrolink]] of which the [[Bury Line]] was part of the [[East Lancashire Railway]]. Other examples can be found in [[London]], [[Boston]], [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]].

In the past 20 years their numbers have been augmented by modern tramway or light rail systems in cities that had discarded this form of transport. There have also been some new tram systems in cities that never previously had them.\n\n''Tramways with tramcars'' ([[British English]]) or ''street railways with streetcars'' ([[North American English]]) were common throughout the industrialised world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but they had disappeared from most British, Canadian, French and US cities by the mid-20th century.<ref>[http://lda.ucdavis.edu/LDA191/Course%20Handouts%20&%20Readings/08-ULI_Streetcars.pdf Jeffrey Spivak: Streetcars are back from Landscape Architecture Department, UC Davis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225095245/http://lda.ucdavis.edu/LDA191/Course%20Handouts%20%26%20Readings/08-ULI_Streetcars.pdf |date=25 February 2009 }}.

New systems have been built in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, France, Australia and many other countries.\n\nIn Milan, Italy, the old \"[[Peter Witt streetcar|Ventotto]]\" trams are considered by its inhabitants a \"symbol\" of the city.

The [[Toronto streetcar system]] had similarly become an iconic symbol of the city, operating the largest network in the Americas as well as the only large-scale tram system in Canada (not including light rail systems, or heritage lines).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/14/streetcars-are-our-neglected-stars-keenan.html|title=Streetcars are our neglected stars|work=The Toronto Star|last=Keenan|first=Edward|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Torstar Corporation|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915120009/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/09/14/streetcars-are-our-neglected-stars-keenan.html|archivedate=15 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/01/toronto_rides_new_streetcars_to_its_urban_future_hume.html|title=Toronto rides new streetcars to its urban future|work=The Toronto Star|first=Christopher|last=Hume|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Torstar Corporation|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909021538/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/09/01/toronto_rides_new_streetcars_to_its_urban_future_hume.html|archivedate=9 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Major tram and light rail systems===\n{{main|List of largest town tramway systems}}\n====Current systems====\n[[File:Melbourne tram extension proposals.gif|thumb|Map of Melbourne's tram system in 2009 (with proposed extension).

However the 21st century has seen a resurgence in development of tram transport as China struggles with urban traffic congestion and pollution with at least 15 systems operating. Hong Kong has an exclusive fleet of double-decker trams. As of 2017, [[Chengdu]], [[Sanya]], [[Wuyishan, Fujian|Wuyishan]] and [[Haikou]] have new tram systems under construction.

This system commenced operations about 1900 and was discontinued by 1960. However, a new tram system is in the process of being brought to Colombo as part of the plan of [[Western Region Megapolis]].\n\nOther countries with discontinued tram systems include Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan and Vietnam. However, a tram system is planned for construction in [[Gwadar]], Pakistan where construction started in late 2011. Trams are also under construction in [[DHA City, Karachi]]. In China the cities of Beijing, Zhuhai, Nanjing and Shenzhen are planning tram networks for the future.\n\n\n[Historic]\n\nIndonesia\n\nIn Batavia (now Jakarta), the capital of the former Dutch colony of the Netherlands East Indies, a horse tram service started in 1869. A steam tram ran from 1881, and electrification followed in 1897. All Jakarta trams were discontinued in the 1960 by an independent Indonesia due to pressure from Sukarno which saw tram network as \"antiquated\" and \"relic of colonial era\".\nThe other cities in Indonesia who used to have urban tram network were Surabaya and Semarang.\n\nSemarang tram network was constructed between 1882 and 1883, and it was essentially the inner suburb extension of Samarang Joana Railway (SJS) network, where they already had extensive rural tram network to the east of Semarang. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties that hampered SJS railway company, Semarang tram network was closed down in 1940 (despite public protest in Semarang) and their rolling stocks were transferred to Surabaya tram network.\n\nSurabaya tram network was first built in 1886. Initially consist of steam tram only, but later another network of electric tram was added in 1923. They served Surabaya commuters well into the independence era. The electric tram bowed out from service in 1968, while its steam counterpart outlived the electrics before bowed out from service in 1978, making it as the very last urban steam tram service in the world to see service.\n\nIn 2012 there is a talk of reviving Surabaya's tram network as a part of Surabaya Mass Rapid Transit project, which will see parts of the old electric tram right of way reactivated, and it will be combined with the future monorail network. The project is aimed to alleviate Surabaya's traffic congestion and provide cheap public transportation for Surabaya commuters. As in 2014 the project have entered tender phase.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|Trams in Europe}}\n[[File:Chlodwigplatz Stadtbahnhaltestelle 2.jpg|thumb|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] is the largest tram network in the [[European Union]].]]\nIn many European cities much tramway infrastructure was lost in the mid-20th century, though not always on the same scale as in other parts of the world such as North America. Most of Central and Eastern Europe retained the majority of its tramway systems and it is here that the largest and busiest tram systems in the world are found.\n\nWhereas most systems and vehicles in the tram sector are found in Central and Eastern Europe, in the 1960s and 1970s, tram systems were shut down in many places in Western Europe, however urban transportation has been experiencing a sustained long running revival since the 1990s.

Sydney reintroduced tram services in 1997 on a modern [[Light rail in Sydney|light rail network]], while Ballarat and Bendigo retained their trams as heritage systems. In 2008 and 2009, Bendigo trialled using its heritage trams for regular public transport. [[Portland, Victoria]], introduced a tourist tram line in 1996, which uses two replicas of a Melbourne cable car dummy or [[cable grip|grip car]], driven by a hidden diesel motor, and two restored trailer cars. A completely new public transport system opened on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] on 20 July 2014, with a major extension completed in December 2017.

Decades after the event, the M&MTB were still citing the incident in training courses as a reason for tram conductors, etc., to keep proper and efficient records.\n\n==Tram modelling==\n{{see also|Rail transport modelling}}\n[[File:Blackburn and East Lancs MRS - 44th annual exhibition - DSC03803.JPG|thumb|A model of a town with a [[Rail transport modelling|tram model]] built into it.]]\nModel trams are popular in [[HO scale]] (1:87) and [[O scale]] (1:48 in the US and generally 1:43,5 and 1:45 in Europe and Asia).

Note how the tram's efficiency surprises the European visitor; how two \"remarkably small\" horses sufficed to draw the \"huge\" tramcar.\n\n* Joseph Conrad described Amsterdam's trams in chapter 14 of ''The Mirror of the Sea'' (1906): \"From afar at the end of Tsar Peter Straat, issued in the frosty air the tinkle of bells of the horse tramcars, appearing and disappearing in the opening between the buildings, like little toy carriages harnessed with toy horses and played with by people that appeared no bigger than children.\"\n* In episode 6 (\"[[Hades]]\") of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1918), the party on the way to Paddy Dignam's funeral in a horse-drawn carriage idly debates the merits of various tramway improvements:\n{{quote|\nI can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.

The force consisted of approximately 20,000 troops, with contingents from: Japan, 10,000; Russia, 4,000; Great Britain, 3,000; United States, 2,000; France, 800; Germany, 200; and Austria and Italy, 100.<ref>War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 567</ref> Reconnaissance indicated that the Chinese forces were entrenched at Beicang, six miles from Tianjin, on both sides of the [[Hai River]]. The Americans, British and Japanese advanced on the west side of the river and the Russians and French on the east. The armies bivouacked the night of August 4/5 near [[Great Hsi-Ku Arsenal|Xigu Fort]]. The Alliance plan was for the Japanese, supported by the British and Americans, to turn the right flank of the Chinese lines and for the Russians and French to turn the left flank on the opposite side of the Hay River.<ref>War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 570</ref> The Chinese force, estimated at between 8,000 and 12,000, was positioned behind several lines of well-constructed earthworks with approximately 26 artillery pieces at key positions. It was, according to contemorary accounts, \"a formidable position to attack\".<ref>Landor, A. Henry Savage. ''China and the Allies''. New York: Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1901, p. 339</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAt 3:00&nbsp;a.m. the Japanese launched the attack by capturing a battery on the extreme right of the Chinese lines. They then pushed forward on the flank of the Chinese positions. At dawn an artillery duel began between the Japanese and Chinese that lasted about a half-hour. During the artillery barrage a Japanese regiment crept forward and launched a direct assault on the Chinese positions near the river, advancing in close order through fields of millet and corn with a barrage of fire from the Chinese trenches pouring onto them.<ref>Thompson, Larry Clinton, ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary''.

However, the Japanese victory on the west bank forced the Chinese to retreat, which they did in good order. The Chinese preserved most of their artillery by withdrawing it early in the battle, an action that, according to a United States' War Department report, \"must have predisposed the rest of their army to its prompt retreat\".<ref name=\"War Department p. 571\">War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 571</ref>\n\nAbout 50 Chinese were killed in the battle. Almost all the Alliance casualties were Japanese, amounting to 60 dead and 240 wounded.

The Alliance army bivouacked at Beicang and its supply train from Tianjin came up during the day. The first battle during the march to Beijing had been a relatively easy victory, albeit costly in casualties for the Japanese. The Chinese now awaited the Alliance in strong defensive positions at [[Battle of Yangcun|Yangcun]].<ref name=\"War Department p. 571\"/>\n\nThe assessment of one participant at the Battle of Beicang was that the \"Chinese troops received a blow from which they never recovered.

The force consisted of approximately 20,000 troops, with contingents from: Japan, 10,000; Russia, 4,000; Great Britain, 3,000; United States, 2,000; France, 800; Germany, 200; and Austria and Italy, 100.<ref>War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 567</ref> Reconnaissance indicated that the Chinese forces were entrenched at Beicang, six miles from Tianjin, on both sides of the [[Hai River]]. The Americans, British and Japanese advanced on the west side of the river and the Russians and French on the east. The armies bivouacked the night of August 4/5 near [[Great Hsi-Ku Arsenal|Xigu Fort]]. The Alliance plan was for the Japanese, supported by the British and Americans, to turn the right flank of the Chinese lines and for the Russians and French to turn the left flank on the opposite side of the Hay River.<ref>War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 570</ref> The Chinese force, estimated at between 8,000 and 12,000, was positioned behind several lines of well-constructed earthworks with approximately 26 artillery pieces at key positions. It was, according to contemorary accounts, \"a formidable position to attack\".<ref>Landor, A. Henry Savage. ''China and the Allies''.

They then pushed forward on the flank of the Chinese positions. At dawn an artillery duel began between the Japanese and Chinese that lasted about a half-hour. During the artillery barrage a Japanese regiment crept forward and launched a direct assault on the Chinese positions near the river, advancing in close order through fields of millet and corn with a barrage of fire from the Chinese trenches pouring onto them.<ref>Thompson, Larry Clinton, ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary''.

However, the Japanese victory on the west bank forced the Chinese to retreat, which they did in good order. The Chinese preserved most of their artillery by withdrawing it early in the battle, an action that, according to a United States' War Department report, \"must have predisposed the rest of their army to its prompt retreat\".<ref name=\"War Department p. 571\">War Department, Adjutant General\u2019s Office, p. 571</ref>\n\nAbout 50 Chinese were killed in the battle.

The Alliance army bivouacked at Beicang and its supply train from Tianjin came up during the day. The first battle during the march to Beijing had been a relatively easy victory, albeit costly in casualties for the Japanese.

Following their split with producer [[Brian Eno]] and a short hiatus, which allowed the individual members to pursue side projects, recording began in 1982. It became the band's commercial breakthrough and produced the band's sole US top-ten hit, \"[[Burning Down the House]]\".\n\nThe album's tour was documented in [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 1984 film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'', which generated [[Stop Making Sense (album)|a live album of the same name]]. The album also crossed over to the dance charts, where it peaked at number two for six weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=253}}</ref> It is the group's highest-charting album on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Artwork==\nDavid Byrne designed the cover for the general release of the album. Artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] won a [[Grammy Award]] for his work on the limited-edition LP version.  This album featured a clear vinyl disc in clear plastic packaging along with three clear plastic discs printed with similar collages in three different colors.\n\n==Release==\nOriginal cassette and later CD copies of the album have \"extended versions\" of \"Making Flippy Floppy\", \"[[Girlfriend Is Better]]\", \"Slippery People\", \"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\" and \"Moon Rocks\".

It contains the extended versions of the songs found on the original cassette, and includes two additional tracks (\"Two Note Swivel\" and an alternate mix of \"[[Burning Down the House]]\"). The DVD-A side includes both stereo and 5.1 surround high resolution (96&nbsp;kHz/24bit) mixes, as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of the album, a new alternate version of \"Burning Down the House\" with the emphasis on experimenting with the possibilities of surround sound, and videos for \"Burning Down the House\" and \"This Must Be the Place\" (videos are two-channel [[Dolby Digital]] only).

Following their split with producer [[Brian Eno]] and a short hiatus, which allowed the individual members to pursue side projects, recording began in 1982. It became the band's commercial breakthrough and produced the band's sole US top-ten hit, \"[[Burning Down the House]]\".\n\nThe album's tour was documented in [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 1984 film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'', which generated [[Stop Making Sense (album)|a live album of the same name]]. The album also crossed over to the dance charts, where it peaked at number two for six weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=253}}</ref> It is the group's highest-charting album on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Artwork==\nDavid Byrne designed the cover for the general release of the album. Artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] won a [[Grammy Award]] for his work on the limited-edition LP version.  This album featured a clear vinyl disc in clear plastic packaging along with three clear plastic discs printed with similar collages in three different colors.\n\n==Release==\nOriginal cassette and later CD copies of the album have \"extended versions\" of \"Making Flippy Floppy\", \"[[Girlfriend Is Better]]\", \"Slippery People\", \"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\" and \"Moon Rocks\". The album was re-released in February 2006 as a remastered [[DualDisc]]. It contains the extended versions of the songs found on the original cassette, and includes two additional tracks (\"Two Note Swivel\" and an alternate mix of \"[[Burning Down the House]]\"). The DVD-A side includes both stereo and 5.1 surround high resolution (96&nbsp;kHz/24bit) mixes, as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of the album, a new alternate version of \"Burning Down the House\" with the emphasis on experimenting with the possibilities of surround sound, and videos for \"Burning Down the House\" and \"This Must Be the Place\" (videos are two-channel [[Dolby Digital]] only). In Europe it was released as a CD+DVDA two-disc set rather than a single DualDisc.

Some of his charming goofiness had returned since the overly serious ''[[Remain in Light]]'' and ''[[Fear of Music]]'', and the accompanying music, filled with odd percussive and synthesizer sounds, could be unusually light and bouncy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/speaking-in-tongues-mw0000196011|title=Speaking in Tongues - Talking Heads - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n===LP/early CD version===\n{{tracklist\n| total_length      = 20:35\n| headline    = Side A\n| all_writing = [[David Byrne]], [[Chris Frantz]], [[Jerry Harrison]], and [[Tina Weymouth]]\n| title1      = [[Burning Down the House]]\n| length1     = 4:01\n| title2      = Making Flippy Floppy\n| length2     = 4:34\n| title3      = [[Girlfriend Is Better]]\n| length3     = 4:22\n| title4      = Slippery People\n| length4     = 3:31\n| title5      = I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\n| length5     = 4:07\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| total_length      = 20:16 (40:51)\n| headline    = Side B\n| title6      = Swamp\n| length6     = 5:12\n| title7      = Moon Rocks\n| length7     = 5:03\n| title8      = Pull Up the Roots\n| length8     = 5:08\n| title9      = [[This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)]]\n| length9     = 4:53\n}}\n===Cassette/later CD versions===\n{{tracklist\n| total_length      = 25:59\n| headline    = Side A\n| title1      = Burning Down the House\n| length1     = 4:01\n| title2      = Making Flippy Floppy (extended version)\n| length2     = 5:54\n| title3      = Girlfriend is Better (extended version)\n| length3     = 5:44\n| title4      = Slippery People (extended version)\n| length4     = 5:05\n| title5      = I Get Wild/Wild Gravity (extended version)\n| length5     = 5:15\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| total_length      = 20:57 (46:56)\n| headline    = Side B\n| title1      = Swamp\n| length1     = 5:12\n| title2      = Moon Rocks (extended version)\n| length2     = 5:44\n| title3      = Pull Up the Roots\n| length3     = 5:08\n| title4      = This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\n| length4     = 4:53\n}}\n\n===2006 DualDisc reissue bonus tracks ===\n{{tracklist\n| total_length      = 57:56\n| title10      = Two Note Swivel (unfinished outtake)\n| length10     = 5:51\n| title11     = Burning Down the House (alternate version)\n| length11     = 5:09\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n[[File:Robert rauschenberg speaking in tongues talking heads.jpg|thumb|''Speaking in Tongues'' limited edition cover designed by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]]]\n<small>Source: <ref>https://www.allmusic.com/album/speaking-in-tongues-mw0000196011/credits</ref></small>\n===Talking Heads===\n*[[David Byrne]] \u2013 [[singing|vocals]], [[Keyboard synthesizer|keyboards]], [[guitar]]s, [[bass guitar]], [[synthesizer]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*[[Chris Frantz]] \u2013 [[drum]]s, backing vocals, synthesizer\n*[[Jerry Harrison]] \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer, guitars, backing vocals\n*[[Tina Weymouth]] \u2013 [[bass guitar]], backing vocals, synthesizer, guitar\n\n===Additional musicians===\n*[[Wally Badarou]] \u2013 synthesizer on \"Burning Down The House\", \"Swamp\" and \"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\"\n*Raphael DeJesus \u2013 percussion on \"Slippery People\", \"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\" and \"Pull Up the Roots\"\n*[[Nona Hendryx]] \u2013 backing vocals on \"Slippery People\"\n*Richard Landry \u2013 [[saxophone]] on \"Slippery People\"\n*Dolette McDonald \u2013 backing vocals on \"Slippery People\"\n*Steve Scales \u2013 percussion on \"Burning Down The House\" and \"Moon Rocks\"\n*[[L.

He started learning music and piano when he was 12 years old. A year later, he received a tape recorder and a guitar for Christmas, and formed a band with school friends. They were playing songs of [[The Shadows]], and some early compositions.\n\nHe then discovered the music of [[the Beatles]] with their huge hit \"[[She Loves You]]\", and started composing more intensely, recording demo songs in his parent's dining room, which gradually became his first home studio, with the purchase of a second tape recorder and more instruments like a drumkit and a second-hand Fender Jazz Bass.\n\nIn those days he composed the music of a song which would become later \"Laat me nu toch niet alleen\", made successful by Belgian artist [[Johan Verminnen]], and more recently by the group [[Clouseau]].\n\nIn 1968, after high school, he decided to become a professional [[recording engineer]]. After a few months in a specialised school, frustrated by the slowness of the studies and the lack of practice, he looked for something more \"in the field\", and was lucky enough to find a job as tape-operator in Studio Madeleine, in Brussels. Working every day in a \"hit making\" studio with some of the top engineers and musicians in Belgium was a dream come true for Dan.\n\nHe soon became captivated by synthesizers, and thanks to his family, bought his first one (the first one in Belgium) in 1970. It was an [[EMS VCS 3]], and Lacksman still owns it : it is part of his collection of vintage analog synthesizers.\n\nAs composer and artist, he had several international hit records in the seventies, and was working as a synthesizer specialist in Belgian and European studios for a lot of famous artists like [[Patrick Hernandez]] (more than 25 million records sold with \"[[Born to Be Alive]]\u201d), [[Plastic Bertrand]] and [[Thijs Van Leer]], from the Dutch band [[Focus (band)|Focus]].\n\nLacksman recorded an album and several singles under his name, and also several instrumental albums of electronic music, using mainly a big [[Moog Music|Moog]] modular system, under the name [[Electronic System]].\n\nIn 1978, he founded the then avant-garde electronic [[Telex (band)|Telex]] together with [[Marc Moulin]] and [[Michel Moers]]. They had some international hits like \u201c[[Moskow Diskow]]\u201d, \u201c[[Spike Jones]]\u201d and \u201cPeanuts\u201d.\n\nIn 1979, he co-produced with Marc Moulin [[Lio]]'s first album, and her first multi-million selling single, \"Le Banana Split\u201d.\n\nIn 1980, he founded Synsound studio I in Brussels, and has worked there with many Belgian and international artists like [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Alain Chamfort]], [[Etienne Daho]], and [[Haruomi Hosono]] from [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. In 1983, he recorded [[Thomas Dolby]]'s second album, ''[[The Flat Earth]]''.\n\nIn 1990, he co-produced with Sacha Chaty, and engineered two albums of French female vocalist, [[Sara Mandiano]], which included her biggest hit  \"J'ai des doutes\". He also co-produced and engineered for the German label Metronome, [[Camouflage (band)|Camouflage]]'s albums ''[[Methods of Silence]]'' and ''[[Bodega Bohemia]]''.\n\nIn March 1995, he opened the second Synsound studio in an old brewery close to his home. The new studio's acoustics were designed by the famous designer [[Andy Munro]] (more than 200 studio designs including [[George Martin|George Martin's]] [[Air studios]] in London).\n\nHe has worked there with artists like [[Will Tura]], [[Maurane]], [[K's Choice]], [[Clouseau (band)|Clouseau]], [[Ozark Henry]], [[Arno]], [[Marie Daulne]] ([[Zap Mama]]), [[Youssou N\u2019Dour]], [[Alain Chamfort]], [[Benabar]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Hooverphonic]], [[David Bowie]], [[Viktor Lazlo]]...\n\nIn 1993 Lacksman produced the first album of [[Deep Forest]] which became a huge hit worldwide. In 1996, he produced, the first album of [[Ozark Henry]], ''[[I'm Seeking Something That Has Already Found Me]]''.\n\nDuring all those years, Lacksman has recorded, mixed and produced albums in all genres, including jazz, [[classic]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[dance music|dance]], and of course electronic music, one of his first passions.

They were playing songs of [[The Shadows]], and some early compositions.\n\nHe then discovered the music of [[the Beatles]] with their huge hit \"[[She Loves You]]\", and started composing more intensely, recording demo songs in his parent's dining room, which gradually became his first home studio, with the purchase of a second tape recorder and more instruments like a drumkit and a second-hand Fender Jazz Bass.\n\nIn those days he composed the music of a song which would become later \"Laat me nu toch niet alleen\", made successful by Belgian artist [[Johan Verminnen]], and more recently by the group [[Clouseau]].\n\nIn 1968, after high school, he decided to become a professional [[recording engineer]]. After a few months in a specialised school, frustrated by the slowness of the studies and the lack of practice, he looked for something more \"in the field\", and was lucky enough to find a job as tape-operator in Studio Madeleine, in Brussels. Working every day in a \"hit making\" studio with some of the top engineers and musicians in Belgium was a dream come true for Dan.\n\nHe soon became captivated by synthesizers, and thanks to his family, bought his first one (the first one in Belgium) in 1970. It was an [[EMS VCS 3]], and Lacksman still owns it : it is part of his collection of vintage analog synthesizers.\n\nAs composer and artist, he had several international hit records in the seventies, and was working as a synthesizer specialist in Belgian and European studios for a lot of famous artists like [[Patrick Hernandez]] (more than 25 million records sold with \"[[Born to Be Alive]]\u201d), [[Plastic Bertrand]] and [[Thijs Van Leer]], from the Dutch band [[Focus (band)|Focus]].\n\nLacksman recorded an album and several singles under his name, and also several instrumental albums of electronic music, using mainly a big [[Moog Music|Moog]] modular system, under the name [[Electronic System]].\n\nIn 1978, he founded the then avant-garde electronic [[Telex (band)|Telex]] together with [[Marc Moulin]] and [[Michel Moers]]. They had some international hits like \u201c[[Moskow Diskow]]\u201d, \u201c[[Spike Jones]]\u201d and \u201cPeanuts\u201d.\n\nIn 1979, he co-produced with Marc Moulin [[Lio]]'s first album, and her first multi-million selling single, \"Le Banana Split\u201d.\n\nIn 1980, he founded Synsound studio I in Brussels, and has worked there with many Belgian and international artists like [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Alain Chamfort]], [[Etienne Daho]], and [[Haruomi Hosono]] from [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. In 1983, he recorded [[Thomas Dolby]]'s second album, ''[[The Flat Earth]]''.\n\nIn 1990, he co-produced with Sacha Chaty, and engineered two albums of French female vocalist, [[Sara Mandiano]], which included her biggest hit  \"J'ai des doutes\". He also co-produced and engineered for the German label Metronome, [[Camouflage (band)|Camouflage]]'s albums ''[[Methods of Silence]]'' and ''[[Bodega Bohemia]]''.\n\nIn March 1995, he opened the second Synsound studio in an old brewery close to his home. The new studio's acoustics were designed by the famous designer [[Andy Munro]] (more than 200 studio designs including [[George Martin|George Martin's]] [[Air studios]] in London).\n\nHe has worked there with artists like [[Will Tura]], [[Maurane]], [[K's Choice]], [[Clouseau (band)|Clouseau]], [[Ozark Henry]], [[Arno]], [[Marie Daulne]] ([[Zap Mama]]), [[Youssou N\u2019Dour]], [[Alain Chamfort]], [[Benabar]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]], [[Hooverphonic]], [[David Bowie]], [[Viktor Lazlo]]...\n\nIn 1993 Lacksman produced the first album of [[Deep Forest]] which became a huge hit worldwide. In 1996, he produced, the first album of [[Ozark Henry]], ''[[I'm Seeking Something That Has Already Found Me]]''.\n\nDuring all those years, Lacksman has recorded, mixed and produced albums in all genres, including jazz, [[classic]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[dance music|dance]], and of course electronic music, one of his first passions. He has combined the big modular Moog IIIP and more vintage analog synthesizers with some of the best virtual plugin synthesizers to form a powerful electronic music studio.\n\n==References==\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synsound.be/team.htm |title=SynSound :: Recording Studios :: Team :: Dan Lacksman |publisher=Synsound.be |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Dan+Lacksman |title=Dan Lacksman \u2013 Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and pictures at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/artist/Dan+Lacksman/a/albums.htm |title=Dan Lacksman Discography and Music at CD Universe |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=2014-06-08 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/goedseel/telex-prod.html |title=Telex - Producing Other Artists/Bands |publisher=Users.skynet.be |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orange-lab.com/tequeno/solo.htm |title=Telex Solo |publisher=Orange-lab.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.danlacksman.be www.danlacksman.be Official website]\n* [http://www.synsound.be/events.htm SynSound Recording Studios]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061205033935/http://telex-music.com/ TELEX-MUSIC.COM]\n* {{Discogs artist|Dan Lacksman}}\n\n{{Telex (band)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lacksman, Dan}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Werl]]\n[[Category:Belgian experimental musicians]]\n[[Category:Synth-pop musicians]]\n[[Category:Belgian composers]]\n[[Category:Belgian audio engineers]]\n[[Category:Belgian record producers]]\n", "name_user": "Deb", "label": "safe", "comment": "bring intro into line with bio standards", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Lacksman"}

W. Awdry]].\n\nThis article lists and details episodes from the thirteenth series of  the show, which was first broadcast in 2010. This series was narrated by [[Michael Angelis]] for the U.K.audiences, although [[Michael Brandon]] narrates the episodes for the U.S. audiences. [[Mark Moraghan]] later re-narrated \"Snow Tracks\" for the ''Santa's Little Engine'' DVD.\n\nThis was Marion Edwards' first series as executive producer.\n\nFollowing the release of the feature-length special DVD ''[[Hero of the Rails]]'' in September 2009 and the theatrical and video releases of select episodes, this series introduces [[computer-generated imagery]] as a replacement for the show's long-standing model animation, as well as a voice cast rather than an individual actor's narration.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news| title = All aboard a refurbished 'Thomas the Tank Engine'| author = Gary Strauss\n | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-06-18-thomas-the-tank-engine_N.htm| work = USA Today| publisher = Gannett Co.

Christopher Skala was joined by Marion Edwards as executive producer. [[Ed Welch]] left after ''The Great Discovery'', while Robert Hartshorne remained. Greg Tiernan and Nicole Stinn replaced Asquith and Spencer as the director and producer.\n\n==Episodes==\nOn 7 November 2009, 4 select episodes were screened theatrically in an event called \"[[Splish, Splash, Splosh]]\". The episodes were then released on DVD of the same name in the U.S., which was later released in the UK on 1 March 2010. Another event, \"Thomas and the Runaway Kite\" screened on January 9, 2010 showed a further 4 episodes, again in the U.S. Series 13 forgot to put the same Play-Along game, Dots-to-Dots, telling which engine it is, the same music video from Series 8-10, and a recurring mini-story which features major locations and recaps episodes from Series 8-11 that take place at the location during the middle of Series 13 in the U.S. The two songs, \"Sounds\" and \"Determination\" by Ed Welch, were introduced during Series 13 after the story.

W. Awdry]].\n\nThis article lists and details episodes from the thirteenth series of  the show, which was first broadcast in 2010. This series was narrated by [[Michael Angelis]] for the U.K.audiences, although [[Michael Brandon]] narrates the episodes for the U.S. audiences. [[Mark Moraghan]] later re-narrated \"Snow Tracks\" for the ''Santa's Little Engine'' DVD.\n\nThis was Marion Edwards' first series as executive producer.\n\nFollowing the release of the feature-length special DVD ''[[Hero of the Rails]]'' in September 2009 and the theatrical and video releases of select episodes, this series introduces [[computer-generated imagery]] as a replacement for the show's long-standing model animation, as well as a voice cast rather than an individual actor's narration.<ref name=usatoday>{{cite news| title = All aboard a refurbished 'Thomas the Tank Engine'| author = Gary Strauss\n | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-06-18-thomas-the-tank-engine_N.htm| work = USA Today| publisher = Gannett Co.

Christopher Skala was joined by Marion Edwards as executive producer. [[Ed Welch]] left after ''The Great Discovery'', while Robert Hartshorne remained. Greg Tiernan and Nicole Stinn replaced Asquith and Spencer as the director and producer.\n\n==Episodes==\nOn 7 November 2009, 4 select episodes were screened theatrically in an event called \"[[Splish, Splash, Splosh]]\". The episodes were then released on DVD of the same name in the U.S., which was later released in the UK on 1 March 2010. Another event, \"Thomas and the Runaway Kite\" screened on January 9, 2010 showed a further 4 episodes, again in the U.S. Series 13 forgot to put the same Play-Along game, Dots-to-Dots, telling which engine it is, the same music video from Series 8-10, and a recurring mini-story which features major locations and recaps episodes from Series 8-11 that take place at the location during the middle of Series 13 in the U.S. The two songs, \"Sounds\" and \"Determination\" by Ed Welch, were introduced during Series 13 after the story. The thirteenth series aired in the U.S. on September 4, 2010.<ref>http://www.ket.org/tvschedules/episode.php?nola=THOF++000601&layout=popup&framed=1</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#FF7B7B|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|airdate=|aux4=|aux4T=TV Order|episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Thomas & Friends (series 13)\n |EpisodeNumber=309\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Aux4=601a\n |Title=Creaky Cranky \n |DirectedBy=[[Greg Tiernan]]\n |WrittenBy=Sharon Miller\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2009|10|26|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary=After Thomas teases him for creaking, Cranky boasts that he is stronger than the little tank engine.
