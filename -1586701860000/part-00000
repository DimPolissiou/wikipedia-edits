He had lived in a decrepit house in the poor section of his town.\n\nWithers recalled to [[SongFacts]] the original inspiration for the song: <blockquote>\"I bought a little piano and I was sitting there just running my fingers up and down the piano. In the course of doing the music, that phrase crossed my mind, so then you go back and say, 'OK, I like the way that phrase, Lean On Me, sounds with this song.'\" <ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/bill_withers/ |title=Songfacts Interview with Bill Withers |website=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWithers stated in the same interview that he made an effort to keep the lyrics simple. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral members of the [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band|Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]] were used for the recording session in 1972. A string section was also included as well.\n\nWithers' version is noted for its bridge section: (\"Just call on me, brother\"), as well as the coda section, where the words \u201dcall me\u201d are repeated a total of 14 times, before the song ends on a cadenza on the strings. Several radio stations, as well as the single version, fade out during the repeated coda, due to time limits as well as the repetition of the lyrics. Some radio versions cut the number of \"Call Me's\" to six times before the song's end.\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Bill Withers]] \u2013 piano, vocals\n* Benorce Blackmon \u2013 guitar\n* Raymond Jackson \u2013 [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], string arrangement\n* Melvin Dunlap \u2013 bass\n* [[James Gadson]] \u2013 drums\n\n==Track listings==\n'''7-inch single'''\n# \"Lean on Me\" \u2013 3:45\n# \"Better Off Dead\" \u2013 2:13\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|Australia<ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226032423/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |archive-date=February 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|UK Singles ([[Official Charts Company]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|title=Cash Box Top 100 7/22/72|author=|date=|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228163555/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|archive-date=February 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2020)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Switzerland|84|artist=Bill Withers|song=Lean on Me|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1972)\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|title=Top 100 Hits of 1972/Top 100 Songs of 1972|author=|date=|website=www.musicoutfitters.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427223218/http://musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|title=Cash Box YE Pop Singles - 1972|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928150812/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Certifications==\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United Kingdom|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Silver|relyear=1972|certyear=2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Gold|relyear=1972|certyear=1972|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom|nosales=true|streaming=true}}\n\n== Club Nouveau version ==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Lean on Me\n| cover      = LeanOnMeCN.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Club Nouveau]]\n| album      = [[Life, Love & Pain]]\n| released   = {{Start date|1987}}\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1986\n| studio     =\n| genre      = \n*[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n*[[Soul music|soul]]\n*[[funk]]\n*[[new jack swing]]\n| length     = \n*{{Duration|6:01}} (LP version)\n*{{Duration|3:58}} (radio edit)\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.

He had lived in a decrepit house in the poor section of his town.\n\nWithers recalled to [[SongFacts]] the original inspiration for the song: <blockquote>\"I bought a little piano and I was sitting there just running my fingers up and down the piano.

A string section was also included as well.\n\nWithers' version is noted for its bridge section: (\"Just call on me, brother\"), as well as the coda section, where the words \u201dcall me\u201d are repeated a total of 14 times, before the song ends on a cadenza on the strings. Several radio stations, as well as the single version, fade out during the repeated coda, due to time limits as well as the repetition of the lyrics. Some radio versions cut the number of \"Call Me's\" to six times before the song's end.\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Bill Withers]] \u2013 piano, vocals\n* Benorce Blackmon \u2013 guitar\n* Raymond Jackson \u2013 [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], string arrangement\n* Melvin Dunlap \u2013 bass\n* [[James Gadson]] \u2013 drums\n\n==Track listings==\n'''7-inch single'''\n# \"Lean on Me\" \u2013 3:45\n# \"Better Off Dead\" \u2013 2:13\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n|Australia<ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992]]|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|24\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226032423/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.7662&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=90ugs3f4f7ud02puqd6m8e23b3 |archive-date=February 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|UK Singles ([[Official Charts Company]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|title=Cash Box Top 100 7/22/72|author=|date=|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228163555/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19720722.html|archive-date=February 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2020)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{single chart|Switzerland|84|artist=Bill Withers|song=Lean on Me|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1972)\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|title=Top 100 Hits of 1972/Top 100 Songs of 1972|author=|date=|website=www.musicoutfitters.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427223218/http://musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1972.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|title=Cash Box YE Pop Singles - 1972|website=tropicalglen.com|accessdate=March 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928150812/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1972YESP.html|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Certifications==\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United Kingdom|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Silver|relyear=1972|certyear=2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=United States|type=single|artist=Bill Withers|title=Lean on Me|award=Gold|relyear=1972|certyear=1972|accessdate=November 9, 2018}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom|nosales=true|streaming=true}}\n\n== Club Nouveau version ==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Lean on Me\n| cover      = LeanOnMeCN.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Club Nouveau]]\n| album      = [[Life, Love & Pain]]\n| released   = {{Start date|1987}}\n| format     =\n| recorded   = 1986\n| studio     =\n| genre      = \n*[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]\n*[[Soul music|soul]]\n*[[funk]]\n*[[new jack swing]]\n| length     = \n*{{Duration|6:01}} (LP version)\n*{{Duration|3:58}} (radio edit)\n| label      = [[Warner Bros.

Their use is also known as \"[[numerical integration]]\", although this term is sometimes taken to mean the computation of [[integral]]s.\n\nMany differential equations cannot be solved using [[symbolic computation]] (\"analysis\"). For practical purposes, however&nbsp;\u2013 such as in engineering&nbsp;\u2013 a numeric approximation to the solution is often sufficient. The [[algorithm]]s studied here can be used to compute such an approximation. An alternative method is to use techniques from [[calculus]] to obtain a [[series expansion]] of the solution.\n\nOrdinary differential equations occur in many scientific disciplines, for instance in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. In addition, some methods in [[numerical partial differential equations]] convert the [[partial differential equation]] into an ordinary differential equation, which must then be solved.\n\n== The problem ==\n\nA first-order differential equation is an [[Initial value problem]] (IVP) of the form,<ref>{{harvtxt|Bradie|2006|pp=533\u2013655}}</ref>\n:<math>y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \\qquad y(t_0)=y_0, \\qquad\\qquad (1)</math>\nwhere ''f'' is a function that maps [''t''<sub>0</sub>,\u221e)&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>d</sup> to '''R'''<sup>d</sup>, and the initial condition ''y''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>d</sup> is a given vector.  ''First-order'' means that only the first derivative of ''y'' appears in the equation, and higher derivatives are absent.\n\nWithout loss of generality to higher-order systems, we restrict ourselves to ''first-order'' differential equations, because a higher-order ODE can be converted into a larger system of first-order equations by introducing extra variables.  For example, the second-order equation \n''y''<nowiki>''</nowiki>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''y'' \ncan be rewritten as two first-order equations: ''y''<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'' and ''z''<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''y''.\n\nIn this section, we describe numerical methods for IVPs, and remark that ''[[boundary value problem]]s'' (BVPs) require a different set of tools.  In a BVP, one defines values, or components of the solution ''y'' at more than one point.  Because of this, different methods need to be used to solve BVPs.  For example, the [[shooting method]] (and its variants) or global methods like [[finite difference]]s, [[Galerkin method]]s, or [[collocation method]]s are appropriate for that class of problems.\n\nThe [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] states that there is a unique solution, provided ''f'' is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz-continuous]].\n\n== Methods ==\n\nNumerical methods for solving first-order IVPs often fall into one of two large categories: [[linear multistep method]]s, or [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]]. A further division can be realized by dividing methods into those that are explicit and those that are implicit. For example,  implicit [[linear multistep method]]s include [[Linear multistep method#Adams\u2013Moulton methods|Adams-Moulton methods]], and [[Backward differentiation formula|backward differentiation methods]] (BDF), whereas [[implicit Runge\u2013Kutta methods]]<ref>{{harvtxt|Hairer|N\u00f8rsett|Wanner|1993|pages=204\u2013215}}</ref> include [[diagonally implicit Runge\u2013Kutta]] (DIRK), [[singly diagonally implicit Runge\u2013Kutta]] (SDIRK), and [[Gauss\u2013Radau]] (based on [[Gaussian quadrature]]) numerical methods. Explicit examples from the [[Linear multistep method|linear multistep family]] include the [[Adams\u2013Bashforth methods]], and any Runge\u2013Kutta method with a lower diagonal [[Butcher tableau]] is [[explicit Runge\u2013Kutta methods|explicit]]. A loose rule of thumb dictates that [[stiff equation|stiff]] differential equations require the use of implicit schemes, whereas non-stiff problems can be solved more efficiently with explicit schemes.\n\nThe so-called [[general linear methods]] (GLMs) are a generalization of the above two large classes of methods.\n\n===Euler method===\n<!--Linked from [[Trigonometric tables]]-->\n{{details|Euler method}}\nFrom any point on a curve, you can find an approximation of a nearby point on the curve by moving a short distance along a line [[tangent]] to the curve.\n\nStarting with the differential equation (1), we replace the derivative ''y''<nowiki>'</nowiki> by the [[finite difference]] approximation\n:<math> y'(t) \\approx \\frac{y(t+h) - y(t)}{h}, \\qquad\\qquad (2) </math>\nwhich when re-arranged yields the following formula\n:<math> y(t+h) \\approx y(t) + hy'(t) \\qquad\\qquad </math>\nand using (1) gives:\n:<math> y(t+h) \\approx y(t) + hf(t,y(t)). \\qquad\\qquad (3) </math>\nThis formula is usually applied in the following way. We choose a step size ''h'', and we construct the sequence ''t''<sub>0</sub>, ''t''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''h'', ''t''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''h'', \u2026 We denote by ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> a numerical estimate of the exact solution ''y''(''t''<sub>''n''</sub>). Motivated by (3), we compute these estimates by the following [[recursion|recursive]] scheme \n:<math> y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n). \\qquad\\qquad (4) </math>\nThis is the ''[[Euler method]]'' (or ''[[forward Euler method]]'', in contrast with the ''backward Euler method'', to be described below). The method is named after [[Leonhard Euler]] who described it in 1768.\n\nThe Euler method is an example of an [[explicit and implicit methods|''explicit'']] method. This means that the new value ''y''<sub>''n+1''</sub> is defined in terms of things that are already known, like ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\n===Backward Euler method===\n{{details|Backward Euler method}}\nIf, instead of (2), we use the approximation\n:<math> y'(t) \\approx \\frac{y(t) - y(t-h)}{h}, \\qquad\\qquad (5)</math>\nwe get the ''backward Euler method'':\n:<math> y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}). \\qquad\\qquad (6)</math>\nThe backward Euler method is an [[explicit and implicit methods|''implicit'']] method, meaning that we have to solve an equation to find ''y''<sub>''n''+1</sub>. One often uses [[fixed-point iteration]] or (some modification of) the [[Newton's method|Newton\u2013Raphson method]] to achieve this.\n\nIt costs more time to solve this equation than explicit methods; this cost must be taken into consideration when one selects the method to use. The advantage of implicit methods such as (6) is that they are usually more stable for solving a [[stiff equation]], meaning that a larger step size ''h'' can be used.\n\n===First-order exponential integrator method===\n{{details|Exponential integrator}}\nExponential integrators describe a large class of integrators that have recently seen a lot of development.<ref name=\"Exponential integrators\">{{harvtxt|Hochbruck|2010|pp=209\u2013286}} This is a modern and extensive review paper for exponential integrators</ref>  They date back to at least the 1960s.\n\nIn place of (1), we assume the differential equation is either of the form\n:<math>y'(t) = -A\\, y+ \\mathcal{N}(y), \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad (7)</math>\nor it has been locally linearized about a background state to produce a linear term <math>-Ay</math> and a nonlinear term <math>\\mathcal{N}(y)</math>.\n\nExponential integrators are constructed by multiplying (7) by <math>e^{A t}</math>, and exactly integrating the result over\na time interval <math>[t_n, t_{n+1} = t_n + h]</math>:\n:<math> y_{n+1} = e^{-A h } y_n + \\int_{0}^{h} e^{ -(h-\\tau) A } \\mathcal{N}\\left( y\\left( t_n+\\tau \\right) \\right)\\, d\\tau. </math>\nThis integral equation is exact, but it doesn't define the integral.\n\nThe first-order exponential integrator can be realized by holding <math>\\mathcal{N}( y( t_n+\\tau ) )</math> constant over the full interval:\n:<math>y_{n+1} = e^{-Ah}y_n + A^{-1}(1-e^{-Ah}) \\mathcal{N}( y( t_n ) )\\ . \\qquad\\qquad (8)</math>\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe Euler method is often not accurate enough. In more precise terms, it only has order one (the concept of ''order'' is explained below). This caused mathematicians to look for higher-order methods.\n\nOne possibility is to use not only the previously computed value ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> to determine ''y''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, but to make the solution depend on more past values. This yields a so-called ''multistep method''. Perhaps the simplest is the [[leapfrog method]] which is second order and (roughly speaking) relies on two time values.\n\nAlmost all practical multistep methods fall within the family of [[linear multistep method]]s, which have the form\n:<math> \\alpha_k y_{n+k} + \\alpha_{k-1} y_{n+k-1} + \\cdots \n+ \\alpha_0 y_n</math>\n::<math> = h \\left[ \\beta_k f(t_{n+k},y_{n+k}) + \\beta_{k-1}\nf(t_{n+k-1},y_{n+k-1}) + \\cdots + \\beta_0 f(t_n,y_n) \\right]. </math>\n\nAnother possibility is to use more points in the interval [''t''<sub>''n''</sub>,''t''<sub>''n''+1</sub>]. This leads to the family of [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]], named after [[Carl David Tolm\u00e9 Runge|Carl Runge]] and [[Martin Kutta]]. One of their fourth-order methods is especially popular.\n\n===Advanced features===\nA good implementation of one of these methods for solving an ODE entails more than the time-stepping formula.\n\nIt is often inefficient to use the same step size all the time, so ''variable step-size methods'' have been developed. Usually, the step size is chosen such that the (local) error per step is below some tolerance level. This means that the methods must also compute an ''error indicator'', an estimate of the local error.\n\nAn extension of this idea is to choose dynamically between different methods of different orders (this is called a ''variable order method''). Methods based on [[Richardson extrapolation]], such as the [[Bulirsch\u2013Stoer algorithm]], are often used to construct various methods of different orders.\n\nOther desirable features include: \n* ''dense output'': cheap numerical approximations for the whole integration interval, and not only at the points ''t''<sub>0</sub>, ''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub>, ...\n* ''event location'': finding the times where, say, a particular function vanishes. This typically requires the use of a [[root-finding algorithm]].\n* support for [[parallel computing]].\n* when used for integrating with respect to time, time reversibility\n\n===Alternative methods===\nMany methods do not fall within the framework discussed here. Some classes of alternative methods are:\n* ''multiderivative methods'', which use not only the function ''f'' but also its derivatives. This class includes ''Hermite\u2013Obreschkoff methods'' and ''[[Runge\u2013Kutta\u2013Fehlberg method|Fehlberg methods]]'', as well as methods like the [[Parker\u2013Sochacki method]] or [[Bychkov\u2013Scherbakov method]], which compute the coefficients of the [[Taylor series]] of the solution ''y'' recursively.\n* ''methods for second order ODEs''. We said that all higher-order ODEs can be transformed to first-order ODEs of the form&nbsp;(1). While this is certainly true, it may not be the best way to proceed. In particular, ''[[Nystr\u00f6m method]]s'' work directly with second-order equations.\n* ''[[geometric integrator|geometric integration methods]]'' are especially designed for special classes of ODEs (e.g., [[symplectic integrator]]s for the solution of [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian equations]]). They take care that the numerical solution respects the underlying structure or geometry of these classes.\n* ''[[Quantized state systems methods]]'' are a family of ODE integration methods based on the idea of state quantization. They are efficient when simulating sparse systems with frequent discontinuities.\n\n===Parallel-in-time methods===\nFor applications that require [[parallel computing]] on [[supercomputer]]s, the degree of concurrency offered by a numerical method becomes relevant. \nIn view of the challenges from [[exascale computing|exascale]] computing systems, numerical methods for [[initial value problem]]s which can provide concurrency in temporal direction are being studied.<ref>{{cite conference\n | last = Gander\n | first = Martin J.\n | authorlink =\n | title = 50 years of Time Parallel Time Integration\n | publisher = Springer International Publishing\n | series = Contributions in Mathematical and Computational Sciences\n | volume = 9\n | edition = 1\n | date = \n | location =\n | pages =\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-23321-5\n | id =\n | isbn = 978-3-319-23321-5\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>\n[[Parareal]] is a relatively well known example of such a ''parallel-in-time'' integration method, but early ideas go back into the 1960s.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Nievergelt\n| first      = J\u00fcrg\n| date       = 1964\n| title      = Parallel methods for integrating ordinary differential equations\n| journal    = Communications of the ACM\n| volume     = 7\n| issue      =  12\n| pages      =  731\u2013733\n| bibcode    = \n| doi        = 10.1145/355588.365137\n}}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n[[Numerical analysis]] is not only the design of numerical methods, but also their analysis. Three central concepts in this analysis are:\n* ''convergence'': whether the method approximates the solution,\n* ''order'': how well it approximates the solution, and\n* [[numerical stability|''stability'']]: whether errors are damped out.\n\n===Convergence===\n{{main|Sequence|Limit (mathematics)|Limit of a sequence}}\nA numerical method is said to be ''convergent'' if the numerical solution approaches the exact solution as the step size ''h'' goes to 0. More precisely, we require that for every ODE (1) with a [[Lipschitz continuous|Lipschitz]] function ''f'' and every ''t''<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to0+} \\max_{n=0,1,\\dots,\\lfloor t^*/h\\rfloor} \\| y_{n,h} - y(t_n) \\| = 0. </math>\n\nAll the methods mentioned above are convergent.\n\n===Consistency and order===\n{{details|Truncation error (numerical integration)}}\nSuppose the numerical method is\n\n:<math> y_{n+k} = \\Psi(t_{n+k}; y_n, y_{n+1}, \\dots, y_{n+k-1}; h). \\, </math>\n\nThe ''local (truncation) error'' of the method is the error committed by one step of the method. That is, it is the difference between the result given by the method, assuming that no error was made in earlier steps, and the exact solution:\n\n:<math> \\delta^h_{n+k} = \\Psi \\left( t_{n+k}; y(t_n), y(t_{n+1}), \\dots, y(t_{n+k-1}); h \\right) - y(t_{n+k}). </math>\n\nThe method is said to be ''consistent'' if \n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\delta^h_{n+k}}{h} = 0. </math>\nThe method has ''order'' <math>p</math> if\n:<math> \\delta^h_{n+k} = O(h^{p+1}) \\quad\\mbox{as } h\\to0. </math>\nHence a method is consistent if it has an order greater than 0. The (forward) Euler method (4) and the backward Euler method (6) introduced above both have order 1, so they are consistent. Most methods being used in practice attain higher order. Consistency is a necessary condition for convergence{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}, but not sufficient; for a method to be convergent, it must be both consistent and [[zero-stable]].\n\nA related concept is the ''global (truncation) error'', the error sustained in all the steps one needs to reach a fixed time ''t''. Explicitly, the global error at time ''t'' is ''y''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''y''(''t'') where ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''t''&minus;''t''<sub>0</sub>)/''h''. The global error of a ''p''th order one-step method is O(''h''<sup>''p''</sup>); in particular, such a method is convergent.  This statement is not necessarily true for multi-step methods.\n\n===Stability and stiffness===\n{{details|Stiff equation}}\nFor some differential equations, application of standard methods\u2014such as the Euler method, explicit [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]], or [[multistep method]]s (e.g., Adams\u2013Bashforth methods)\u2014exhibit instability in the solutions, though other methods may produce stable solutions. This \"difficult behaviour\" in the equation (which may not necessarily be complex itself) is described as ''stiffness'', and is often caused by the presence of different time scales in the underlying problem. For example, a collision in a mechanical system like in an [[impact oscillator]] typically occurs at much smaller time scale than the time for the motion of objects; this discrepancy makes for very \"sharp turns\" in the curves of the state parameters.\n\nStiff problems are ubiquitous in [[chemical kinetics]], [[control theory]], [[solid mechanics]], [[weather forecasting]], [[biology]], [[plasma physics]], and [[electronics]]. One way to overcome stiffness is to extend the notion of differential equation to that of [[differential inclusion]], which allows for and models non-smoothness.<ref name=\"Fiedler2001\">{{cite book|editor=Bernold Fiedler|title=Ergodic Theory, Analysis, and Efficient Simulation of Dynamical Systems|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-41290-8|page=431|chapter=Non-smooth Dynamical Systems: An Overview|authors=Markus Kunze and Tassilo Kupper}}</ref><ref name=\"ZanderSchieferdecker2011\">{{cite book|editor=Justyna Zander, Ina Schieferdecker and Pieter J.

Curtiss]] and [[Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder]] coin the term ''[[stiff equation]]s''.\n* 1963 - [[Germund Dahlquist]] introduces ''[[Stiff equation#A-stability|A-stability]]'' of integration methods.\n\n== Numerical solutions to second-order one-dimensional boundary value problems ==\n\nBoundary value problems (BVPs) are usually solved numerically by solving an approximately equivalent matrix problem obtained by discretizing the original BVP. The most commonly used method for numerically solving BVPs in one dimension is called the [[Finite Difference Method]].  This method takes advantage of linear combinations of point values to construct [[finite difference coefficient]]s that describe derivatives of the function. For example, the second-order [[central difference]] approximation to the first derivative is given by:\n\n: <math> \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2h} = u'(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2), </math>\n\nand the second-order [[central difference]] for the second derivative is given by:\n\n: <math> \\frac{u_{i+1}- 2 u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} = u''(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2). </math>\n\nIn both of these formulae, <math> h=x_i-x_{i-1}</math> is the distance between neighbouring ''x'' values on the discretized domain. One then constructs a linear system that can then be solved by standard [[numerical linear algebra|matrix methods]]. For instance, suppose the equation to be solved is:\n\n: <math> \\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} -u =0, </math>\n\n: <math> u(0)=0, </math>\n\n: <math> u(1)=1. </math>\n\nThe next step would be to discretize the problem and use linear derivative approximations such as\n\n: <math> u''_i =\\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_{i}+u_{i-1}}{h^2} </math>\n\nand solve the resulting system of linear equations. This would lead to equations such as:\n\n: <math> \\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_{i}+u_{i-1}}{h^2}-u_i = 0, \\quad \\forall i={1,2,3,...,n-1}.</math>\n\nOn first viewing, this system of equations appears to have difficulty associated with the fact that the equation involves no terms that are not multiplied by variables, but in fact this is false. At ''i'' = 1 and ''n'' &minus; 1 there is a term involving the boundary values <math>u(0)=u_0 </math> and <math> u(1)=u_n  </math> and since these two values are known, one can simply substitute them into this equation and as a result have a non-homogeneous linear system of equations that has non-trivial solutions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition]]\n* [[Energy drift]]\n* [[General linear methods]]\n* [[List of numerical analysis topics#Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations]]\n* [[Reversible reference system propagation algorithm]]\n*[[Modelica]] Language and [[OpenModelica]] software\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book|last=Bradie|first=Brian|title=A Friendly Introduction to Numerical Analysis|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-013054-9}}\n*[[John C.

Their use is also known as \"[[numerical integration]]\", although this term is sometimes taken to mean the computation of [[integral]]s.\n\nMany differential equations cannot be solved using [[symbolic computation]] (\"analysis\"). For practical purposes, however&nbsp;\u2013 such as in engineering&nbsp;\u2013 a numeric approximation to the solution is often sufficient. The [[algorithm]]s studied here can be used to compute such an approximation. An alternative method is to use techniques from [[calculus]] to obtain a [[series expansion]] of the solution.\n\nOrdinary differential equations occur in many scientific disciplines, for instance in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. In addition, some methods in [[numerical partial differential equations]] convert the [[partial differential equation]] into an ordinary differential equation, which must then be solved.\n\n== The problem ==\n\nA first-order differential equation is an [[Initial value problem]] (IVP) of the form,<ref>{{harvtxt|Bradie|2006|pp=533\u2013655}}</ref>\n:<math>y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \\qquad y(t_0)=y_0, \\qquad\\qquad (1)</math>\nwhere ''f'' is a function that maps [''t''<sub>0</sub>,\u221e)&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>d</sup> to '''R'''<sup>d</sup>, and the initial condition ''y''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>d</sup> is a given vector.  ''First-order'' means that only the first derivative of ''y'' appears in the equation, and higher derivatives are absent.\n\nWithout loss of generality to higher-order systems, we restrict ourselves to ''first-order'' differential equations, because a higher-order ODE can be converted into a larger system of first-order equations by introducing extra variables.  For example, the second-order equation \n''y''<nowiki>''</nowiki>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''y'' \ncan be rewritten as two first-order equations: ''y''<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'' and ''z''<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''y''.\n\nIn this section, we describe numerical methods for IVPs, and remark that ''[[boundary value problem]]s'' (BVPs) require a different set of tools.  In a BVP, one defines values, or components of the solution ''y'' at more than one point.  Because of this, different methods need to be used to solve BVPs.  For example, the [[shooting method]] (and its variants) or global methods like [[finite difference]]s, [[Galerkin method]]s, or [[collocation method]]s are appropriate for that class of problems.\n\nThe [[Picard&ndash;Lindel\u00f6f theorem]] states that there is a unique solution, provided ''f'' is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz-continuous]].\n\n== Methods ==\n\nNumerical methods for solving first-order IVPs often fall into one of two large categories: [[linear multistep method]]s, or [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]]. A further division can be realized by dividing methods into those that are explicit and those that are implicit. For example,  implicit [[linear multistep method]]s include [[Linear multistep method#Adams\u2013Moulton methods|Adams-Moulton methods]], and [[Backward differentiation formula|backward differentiation methods]] (BDF), whereas [[implicit Runge\u2013Kutta methods]]<ref>{{harvtxt|Hairer|N\u00f8rsett|Wanner|1993|pages=204\u2013215}}</ref> include [[diagonally implicit Runge\u2013Kutta]] (DIRK), [[singly diagonally implicit Runge\u2013Kutta]] (SDIRK), and [[Gauss\u2013Radau]] (based on [[Gaussian quadrature]]) numerical methods. Explicit examples from the [[Linear multistep method|linear multistep family]] include the [[Adams\u2013Bashforth methods]], and any Runge\u2013Kutta method with a lower diagonal [[Butcher tableau]] is [[explicit Runge\u2013Kutta methods|explicit]]. A loose rule of thumb dictates that [[stiff equation|stiff]] differential equations require the use of implicit schemes, whereas non-stiff problems can be solved more efficiently with explicit schemes.\n\nThe so-called [[general linear methods]] (GLMs) are a generalization of the above two large classes of methods.\n\n===Euler method===\n<!--Linked from [[Trigonometric tables]]-->\n{{details|Euler method}}\nFrom any point on a curve, you can find an approximation of a nearby point on the curve by moving a short distance along a line [[tangent]] to the curve.\n\nStarting with the differential equation (1), we replace the derivative ''y''<nowiki>'</nowiki> by the [[finite difference]] approximation\n:<math> y'(t) \\approx \\frac{y(t+h) - y(t)}{h}, \\qquad\\qquad (2) </math>\nwhich when re-arranged yields the following formula\n:<math> y(t+h) \\approx y(t) + hy'(t) \\qquad\\qquad </math>\nand using (1) gives:\n:<math> y(t+h) \\approx y(t) + hf(t,y(t)). \\qquad\\qquad (3) </math>\nThis formula is usually applied in the following way. We choose a step size ''h'', and we construct the sequence ''t''<sub>0</sub>, ''t''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''h'', ''t''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''h'', \u2026 We denote by ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> a numerical estimate of the exact solution ''y''(''t''<sub>''n''</sub>). Motivated by (3), we compute these estimates by the following [[recursion|recursive]] scheme \n:<math> y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_n,y_n). \\qquad\\qquad (4) </math>\nThis is the ''[[Euler method]]'' (or ''[[forward Euler method]]'', in contrast with the ''backward Euler method'', to be described below). The method is named after [[Leonhard Euler]] who described it in 1768.\n\nThe Euler method is an example of an [[explicit and implicit methods|''explicit'']] method. This means that the new value ''y''<sub>''n+1''</sub> is defined in terms of things that are already known, like ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\n===Backward Euler method===\n{{details|Backward Euler method}}\nIf, instead of (2), we use the approximation\n:<math> y'(t) \\approx \\frac{y(t) - y(t-h)}{h}, \\qquad\\qquad (5)</math>\nwe get the ''backward Euler method'':\n:<math> y_{n+1} = y_n + hf(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}). \\qquad\\qquad (6)</math>\nThe backward Euler method is an [[explicit and implicit methods|''implicit'']] method, meaning that we have to solve an equation to find ''y''<sub>''n''+1</sub>. One often uses [[fixed-point iteration]] or (some modification of) the [[Newton's method|Newton\u2013Raphson method]] to achieve this.\n\nIt costs more time to solve this equation than explicit methods; this cost must be taken into consideration when one selects the method to use. The advantage of implicit methods such as (6) is that they are usually more stable for solving a [[stiff equation]], meaning that a larger step size ''h'' can be used.\n\n===First-order exponential integrator method===\n{{details|Exponential integrator}}\nExponential integrators describe a large class of integrators that have recently seen a lot of development.<ref name=\"Exponential integrators\">{{harvtxt|Hochbruck|2010|pp=209\u2013286}} This is a modern and extensive review paper for exponential integrators</ref>  They date back to at least the 1960s.\n\nIn place of (1), we assume the differential equation is either of the form\n:<math>y'(t) = -A\\, y+ \\mathcal{N}(y), \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad (7)</math>\nor it has been locally linearized about a background state to produce a linear term <math>-Ay</math> and a nonlinear term <math>\\mathcal{N}(y)</math>.\n\nExponential integrators are constructed by multiplying (7) by <math>e^{A t}</math>, and exactly integrating the result over\na time interval <math>[t_n, t_{n+1} = t_n + h]</math>:\n:<math> y_{n+1} = e^{-A h } y_n + \\int_{0}^{h} e^{ -(h-\\tau) A } \\mathcal{N}\\left( y\\left( t_n+\\tau \\right) \\right)\\, d\\tau. </math>\nThis integral equation is exact, but it doesn't define the integral.\n\nThe first-order exponential integrator can be realized by holding <math>\\mathcal{N}( y( t_n+\\tau ) )</math> constant over the full interval:\n:<math>y_{n+1} = e^{-Ah}y_n + A^{-1}(1-e^{-Ah}) \\mathcal{N}( y( t_n ) )\\ . \\qquad\\qquad (8)</math>\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe Euler method is often not accurate enough. In more precise terms, it only has order one (the concept of ''order'' is explained below). This caused mathematicians to look for higher-order methods.\n\nOne possibility is to use not only the previously computed value ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> to determine ''y''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, but to make the solution depend on more past values. This yields a so-called ''multistep method''. Perhaps the simplest is the [[leapfrog method]] which is second order and (roughly speaking) relies on two time values.\n\nAlmost all practical multistep methods fall within the family of [[linear multistep method]]s, which have the form\n:<math> \\alpha_k y_{n+k} + \\alpha_{k-1} y_{n+k-1} + \\cdots \n+ \\alpha_0 y_n</math>\n::<math> = h \\left[ \\beta_k f(t_{n+k},y_{n+k}) + \\beta_{k-1}\nf(t_{n+k-1},y_{n+k-1}) + \\cdots + \\beta_0 f(t_n,y_n) \\right]. </math>\n\nAnother possibility is to use more points in the interval [''t''<sub>''n''</sub>,''t''<sub>''n''+1</sub>]. This leads to the family of [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]], named after [[Carl David Tolm\u00e9 Runge|Carl Runge]] and [[Martin Kutta]]. One of their fourth-order methods is especially popular.\n\n===Advanced features===\nA good implementation of one of these methods for solving an ODE entails more than the time-stepping formula.\n\nIt is often inefficient to use the same step size all the time, so ''variable step-size methods'' have been developed. Usually, the step size is chosen such that the (local) error per step is below some tolerance level. This means that the methods must also compute an ''error indicator'', an estimate of the local error.\n\nAn extension of this idea is to choose dynamically between different methods of different orders (this is called a ''variable order method''). Methods based on [[Richardson extrapolation]], such as the [[Bulirsch\u2013Stoer algorithm]], are often used to construct various methods of different orders.\n\nOther desirable features include: \n* ''dense output'': cheap numerical approximations for the whole integration interval, and not only at the points ''t''<sub>0</sub>, ''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub>, ...\n* ''event location'': finding the times where, say, a particular function vanishes. This typically requires the use of a [[root-finding algorithm]].\n* support for [[parallel computing]].\n* when used for integrating with respect to time, time reversibility\n\n===Alternative methods===\nMany methods do not fall within the framework discussed here. Some classes of alternative methods are:\n* ''multiderivative methods'', which use not only the function ''f'' but also its derivatives. This class includes ''Hermite\u2013Obreschkoff methods'' and ''[[Runge\u2013Kutta\u2013Fehlberg method|Fehlberg methods]]'', as well as methods like the [[Parker\u2013Sochacki method]] or [[Bychkov\u2013Scherbakov method]], which compute the coefficients of the [[Taylor series]] of the solution ''y'' recursively.\n* ''methods for second order ODEs''. We said that all higher-order ODEs can be transformed to first-order ODEs of the form&nbsp;(1). While this is certainly true, it may not be the best way to proceed. In particular, ''[[Nystr\u00f6m method]]s'' work directly with second-order equations.\n* ''[[geometric integrator|geometric integration methods]]'' are especially designed for special classes of ODEs (e.g., [[symplectic integrator]]s for the solution of [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian equations]]). They take care that the numerical solution respects the underlying structure or geometry of these classes.\n* ''[[Quantized state systems methods]]'' are a family of ODE integration methods based on the idea of state quantization. They are efficient when simulating sparse systems with frequent discontinuities.\n\n===Parallel-in-time methods===\nFor applications that require [[parallel computing]] on [[supercomputer]]s, the degree of concurrency offered by a numerical method becomes relevant. \nIn view of the challenges from [[exascale computing|exascale]] computing systems, numerical methods for [[initial value problem]]s which can provide concurrency in temporal direction are being studied.<ref>{{cite conference\n | last = Gander\n | first = Martin J.\n | authorlink =\n | title = 50 years of Time Parallel Time Integration\n | publisher = Springer International Publishing\n | series = Contributions in Mathematical and Computational Sciences\n | volume = 9\n | edition = 1\n | date = \n | location =\n | pages =\n | language =\n | url =\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-23321-5\n | id =\n | isbn = 978-3-319-23321-5\n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>\n[[Parareal]] is a relatively well known example of such a ''parallel-in-time'' integration method, but early ideas go back into the 1960s.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Nievergelt\n| first      = J\u00fcrg\n| date       = 1964\n| title      = Parallel methods for integrating ordinary differential equations\n| journal    = Communications of the ACM\n| volume     = 7\n| issue      =  12\n| pages      =  731\u2013733\n| bibcode    = \n| doi        = 10.1145/355588.365137\n}}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n[[Numerical analysis]] is not only the design of numerical methods, but also their analysis. Three central concepts in this analysis are:\n* ''convergence'': whether the method approximates the solution,\n* ''order'': how well it approximates the solution, and\n* [[numerical stability|''stability'']]: whether errors are damped out.\n\n===Convergence===\n{{main|Sequence|Limit (mathematics)|Limit of a sequence}}\nA numerical method is said to be ''convergent'' if the numerical solution approaches the exact solution as the step size ''h'' goes to 0. More precisely, we require that for every ODE (1) with a [[Lipschitz continuous|Lipschitz]] function ''f'' and every ''t''<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to0+} \\max_{n=0,1,\\dots,\\lfloor t^*/h\\rfloor} \\| y_{n,h} - y(t_n) \\| = 0. </math>\n\nAll the methods mentioned above are convergent.\n\n===Consistency and order===\n{{details|Truncation error (numerical integration)}}\nSuppose the numerical method is\n\n:<math> y_{n+k} = \\Psi(t_{n+k}; y_n, y_{n+1}, \\dots, y_{n+k-1}; h). \\, </math>\n\nThe ''local (truncation) error'' of the method is the error committed by one step of the method. That is, it is the difference between the result given by the method, assuming that no error was made in earlier steps, and the exact solution:\n\n:<math> \\delta^h_{n+k} = \\Psi \\left( t_{n+k}; y(t_n), y(t_{n+1}), \\dots, y(t_{n+k-1}); h \\right) - y(t_{n+k}). </math>\n\nThe method is said to be ''consistent'' if \n:<math> \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\delta^h_{n+k}}{h} = 0. </math>\nThe method has ''order'' <math>p</math> if\n:<math> \\delta^h_{n+k} = O(h^{p+1}) \\quad\\mbox{as } h\\to0. </math>\nHence a method is consistent if it has an order greater than 0. The (forward) Euler method (4) and the backward Euler method (6) introduced above both have order 1, so they are consistent. Most methods being used in practice attain higher order. Consistency is a necessary condition for convergence{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}, but not sufficient; for a method to be convergent, it must be both consistent and [[zero-stable]].\n\nA related concept is the ''global (truncation) error'', the error sustained in all the steps one needs to reach a fixed time ''t''. Explicitly, the global error at time ''t'' is ''y''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''y''(''t'') where ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''t''&minus;''t''<sub>0</sub>)/''h''. The global error of a ''p''th order one-step method is O(''h''<sup>''p''</sup>); in particular, such a method is convergent.  This statement is not necessarily true for multi-step methods.\n\n===Stability and stiffness===\n{{details|Stiff equation}}\nFor some differential equations, application of standard methods\u2014such as the Euler method, explicit [[Runge\u2013Kutta methods]], or [[multistep method]]s (e.g., Adams\u2013Bashforth methods)\u2014exhibit instability in the solutions, though other methods may produce stable solutions. This \"difficult behaviour\" in the equation (which may not necessarily be complex itself) is described as ''stiffness'', and is often caused by the presence of different time scales in the underlying problem. For example, a collision in a mechanical system like in an [[impact oscillator]] typically occurs at much smaller time scale than the time for the motion of objects; this discrepancy makes for very \"sharp turns\" in the curves of the state parameters.\n\nStiff problems are ubiquitous in [[chemical kinetics]], [[control theory]], [[solid mechanics]], [[weather forecasting]], [[biology]], [[plasma physics]], and [[electronics]]. One way to overcome stiffness is to extend the notion of differential equation to that of [[differential inclusion]], which allows for and models non-smoothness.<ref name=\"Fiedler2001\">{{cite book|editor=Bernold Fiedler|title=Ergodic Theory, Analysis, and Efficient Simulation of Dynamical Systems|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-41290-8|page=431|chapter=Non-smooth Dynamical Systems: An Overview|authors=Markus Kunze and Tassilo Kupper}}</ref><ref name=\"ZanderSchieferdecker2011\">{{cite book|editor=Justyna Zander, Ina Schieferdecker and Pieter J.

In this proof, Cauchy uses the implicit Euler method.\n* 1855 - First mention of the [[multistep method]]s of [[John Couch Adams]] in a letter written by [[Francis Bashforth]].\n* 1895 - [[Carl David Tolm\u00e9 Runge|Carl Runge]] publishes the first [[Runge\u2013Kutta method]].\n* 1901 - [[Martin Kutta]] describes the popular fourth-order [[Runge\u2013Kutta method]].\n* 1910 - [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] announces his [[extrapolation method]], [[Richardson extrapolation]].\n* 1952 - [[Charles F. Curtiss]] and [[Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder]] coin the term ''[[stiff equation]]s''.\n* 1963 - [[Germund Dahlquist]] introduces ''[[Stiff equation#A-stability|A-stability]]'' of integration methods.\n\n== Numerical solutions to second-order one-dimensional boundary value problems ==\n\nBoundary value problems (BVPs) are usually solved numerically by solving an approximately equivalent matrix problem obtained by discretizing the original BVP. The most commonly used method for numerically solving BVPs in one dimension is called the [[Finite Difference Method]].  This method takes advantage of linear combinations of point values to construct [[finite difference coefficient]]s that describe derivatives of the function. For example, the second-order [[central difference]] approximation to the first derivative is given by:\n\n: <math> \\frac{u_{i+1}-u_{i-1}}{2h} = u'(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2), </math>\n\nand the second-order [[central difference]] for the second derivative is given by:\n\n: <math> \\frac{u_{i+1}- 2 u_i + u_{i-1}}{h^2} = u''(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2). </math>\n\nIn both of these formulae, <math> h=x_i-x_{i-1}</math> is the distance between neighbouring ''x'' values on the discretized domain. One then constructs a linear system that can then be solved by standard [[numerical linear algebra|matrix methods]]. For instance, suppose the equation to be solved is:\n\n: <math> \\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} -u =0, </math>\n\n: <math> u(0)=0, </math>\n\n: <math> u(1)=1. </math>\n\nThe next step would be to discretize the problem and use linear derivative approximations such as\n\n: <math> u''_i =\\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_{i}+u_{i-1}}{h^2} </math>\n\nand solve the resulting system of linear equations. This would lead to equations such as:\n\n: <math> \\frac{u_{i+1}-2u_{i}+u_{i-1}}{h^2}-u_i = 0, \\quad \\forall i={1,2,3,...,n-1}.</math>\n\nOn first viewing, this system of equations appears to have difficulty associated with the fact that the equation involves no terms that are not multiplied by variables, but in fact this is false. At ''i'' = 1 and ''n'' &minus; 1 there is a term involving the boundary values <math>u(0)=u_0 </math> and <math> u(1)=u_n  </math> and since these two values are known, one can simply substitute them into this equation and as a result have a non-homogeneous linear system of equations that has non-trivial solutions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition]]\n* [[Energy drift]]\n* [[General linear methods]]\n* [[List of numerical analysis topics#Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations]]\n* [[Reversible reference system propagation algorithm]]\n*[[Modelica]] Language and [[OpenModelica]] software\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book|last=Bradie|first=Brian|title=A Friendly Introduction to Numerical Analysis|year=2006|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-013054-9}}\n*[[John C.

Most of the routes are centered and serve UMass Amherst, which has over two-thirds of the student enrollment of the Five Colleges, but two routes, Route 38, connects Mount Holyoke College to UMass Amherst via Hampshire and Amherst Colleges, and Route 39 connects Smith and Hampshire Colleges (with some weekday trips and all evening and weekend trips when classes are in session operating to Mount Holyoke College). The buses, operated by student workers from UMass Amherst, run on frequent schedule seven days a week when classes are in session, allowing car-free travel to class and social events.  Hourly buses run into the early morning on weekends, an alternative to driving after drinking.  This service is funded through a contract with the member institutions. The PVTA also operates two non-UMass Transit routes (the Maroon 40 Minuteman Express, and the Blue-43) that connect UMass Amherst with Smith College via [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. All of these routes are free to ride for students, staff, and faculty of the Five Colleges Consortium.\n\n[[Greyhound Bus Lines]], [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]], and [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] offer intercity bus service to the region. The major terminal for the region is the Springfield Bus Station, from which services are provided both north\u2013south and east\u2013west to Vermont and New York City, and to Boston and Albany, respectively. Megabus makes its stop in the region at [[Hampshire Mall]] in Hadley en route to Vermont and New York City, while Greyhound makes an additional stop in Northampton and Peter Pan also calls at UMass Haigis Mall.\n\n===Rail===\nAmtrak's [[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]] service operates through the [[Pioneer Valley]] once a day in each direction, with station stops in Northampton, Holyoke and Springfield. The PVTA provides bus service from stops near the Amtrak station to all of the colleges in the Five College Consortium.\n\nAdditional service is offered at the [[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|Union Station]] in Springfield, where [[Northeast Regional]] direct and [[New Haven\u2013Springfield Shuttle|shuttle]] provide service to points south along the Northeast Corridor.\n\n[[Amtrak]] service to [[Amherst (Amtrak station)|Amherst station]] ended on December 28, 2014 when the Vermonter was rerouted through Northampton. Prior to the rerouting, [[Amtrak]] service was offered at the [[Amherst (Amtrak station)|station]] once each way via the [[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]].  It was contiguous to the Amherst College campus and a PVTA bus stop.\n\n===Air===\n\n;Airlines\nMajor domestic scheduled airline service is available at both [[Bradley International Airport]] (FAA: '''BDL''') in northern Connecticut (45 minutes) and [[Logan International Airport]] (FAA: '''BOS''') in Boston (120 minutes).  Logan offers extensive international flights.\n\n;General aviation\n[[Northampton Airport]] (FAA: '''7B2''') and [[Turners Falls Airport]] (FAA: '''OB5''') are the closest dedicated general aviation airports.  They offer 24-hour access for private aircraft, including corporate jets.  7B2 and 0B5 can only accommodate very small corporate jets.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cooperating Colleges of Greater Springfield]], a local association of colleges which often collaborate with Five College institutions\n* [[Museums10]] - a collaboration of several local museums run by the Five Colleges\n* [[UMassFive College Federal Credit Union]]\n\n{{Portal bar|United States}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.fivecolleges.edu/}}\n\n{{Five Colleges}}\n{{Amherst College}}\n{{Hampshire College}}\n{{Mount Holyoke College}}\n{{Smith College}}\n{{University of Massachusetts Amherst}}\n\n[[Category:Amherst College]]\n[[Category:College and university associations and consortia in the United States]]\n[[Category:Hampshire College]]\n[[Category:Mount Holyoke College]]\n[[Category:Smith College]]\n[[Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple image\n|width=250|direction=vertical\n|image1=FiveCollege.png\n|image2=Five College Consortium Collage.jpg\n|footer = Clockwise from top: [[Amherst College]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Smith College]].\n}}\nThe '''Five College Consortium''' comprises four [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]]s  and one [[university]] in the [[Connecticut River]] [[Pioneer Valley]] of [[Western Massachusetts]]: [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref name=\"5colleges\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu/|title=Five College Consortium|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fivecolleges.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref> totaling approximately 38,000 students.

Most of the routes are centered and serve UMass Amherst, which has over two-thirds of the student enrollment of the Five Colleges, but two routes, Route 38, connects Mount Holyoke College to UMass Amherst via Hampshire and Amherst Colleges, and Route 39 connects Smith and Hampshire Colleges (with some weekday trips and all evening and weekend trips when classes are in session operating to Mount Holyoke College). The buses, operated by student workers from UMass Amherst, run on frequent schedule seven days a week when classes are in session, allowing car-free travel to class and social events.  Hourly buses run into the early morning on weekends, an alternative to driving after drinking.  This service is funded through a contract with the member institutions. The PVTA also operates two non-UMass Transit routes (the Maroon 40 Minuteman Express, and the Blue-43) that connect UMass Amherst with Smith College via [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. All of these routes are free to ride for students, staff, and faculty of the Five Colleges Consortium.\n\n[[Greyhound Bus Lines]], [[Peter Pan Bus Lines]], and [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] offer intercity bus service to the region. The major terminal for the region is the Springfield Bus Station, from which services are provided both north\u2013south and east\u2013west to Vermont and New York City, and to Boston and Albany, respectively. Megabus makes its stop in the region at [[Hampshire Mall]] in Hadley en route to Vermont and New York City, while Greyhound makes an additional stop in Northampton and Peter Pan also calls at UMass Haigis Mall.\n\n===Rail===\nAmtrak's [[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]] service operates through the [[Pioneer Valley]] once a day in each direction, with station stops in Northampton, Holyoke and Springfield. The PVTA provides bus service from stops near the Amtrak station to all of the colleges in the Five College Consortium.\n\nAdditional service is offered at the [[Springfield Union Station (Massachusetts)|Union Station]] in Springfield, where [[Northeast Regional]] direct and [[New Haven\u2013Springfield Shuttle|shuttle]] provide service to points south along the Northeast Corridor.\n\n[[Amtrak]] service to [[Amherst (Amtrak station)|Amherst station]] ended on December 28, 2014 when the Vermonter was rerouted through Northampton. Prior to the rerouting, [[Amtrak]] service was offered at the [[Amherst (Amtrak station)|station]] once each way via the [[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]].  It was contiguous to the Amherst College campus and a PVTA bus stop.\n\n===Air===\n\n;Airlines\nMajor domestic scheduled airline service is available at both [[Bradley International Airport]] (FAA: '''BDL''') in northern Connecticut (45 minutes) and [[Logan International Airport]] (FAA: '''BOS''') in Boston (120 minutes).  Logan offers extensive international flights.\n\n;General aviation\n[[Northampton Airport]] (FAA: '''7B2''') and [[Turners Falls Airport]] (FAA: '''OB5''') are the closest dedicated general aviation airports.  They offer 24-hour access for private aircraft, including corporate jets.  7B2 and 0B5 can only accommodate very small corporate jets.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cooperating Colleges of Greater Springfield]], a local association of colleges which often collaborate with Five College institutions\n* [[Museums10]] - a collaboration of several local museums run by the Five Colleges\n* [[UMassFive College Federal Credit Union]]\n\n{{Portal bar|United States}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.fivecolleges.edu/}}\n\n{{Five Colleges}}\n{{Amherst College}}\n{{Hampshire College}}\n{{Mount Holyoke College}}\n{{Smith College}}\n{{University of Massachusetts Amherst}}\n\n[[Category:Amherst College]]\n[[Category:College and university associations and consortia in the United States]]\n[[Category:Hampshire College]]\n[[Category:Mount Holyoke College]]\n[[Category:Smith College]]\n[[Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst]]\n", "name_user": "AndyAnderson", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moved isolated population phrase inside of previous sentence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_College_Consortium"}

But they're very different to sing; they both have their rules.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> Lyricwise, Treichler often uses [[double entendre]]s: the track \"L'Amourir\" from ''L'eau rouge'' can be interpreted as \"an intense love song or the end of a love affair.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> The title track from ''L'eau rouge'' is regarded as \"a celebration of <nowiki>'red water'</nowiki>\" and is a reference to [[menstruation]].<ref name=\"allmusic-1989\"/> The track \"Lucidogen\" from ''Second Nature'' illustrates \"a fictitious drug which would make people more [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]\" and was inspired by an anti-[[World Trade Organization]] riot that Treichler witnessed in Geneva in 1998.<ref name=\"spike-second-nature\"/> On ''The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion and Rock 'n' Roll'', authors [[Simon Reynolds]] and [[Joy Press]] argued: \"Treichler's lyrics brought out all the militaristic, fascistic tendencies inherent in [[Romanticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] et al., only to transcend and transfigure them;\"<ref name=\"sex-revolts\"/> in a 1995 interview, Treichler dismissed Reynolds's and Press's Nietzschean interpretation of his lyrics.<ref name=\"mtv-young-gods\"/>\n{{Quote box\n |title = \n |width=340px\n |align=left\n |quote = I thought they had some extraordinary ideas, by taking one chunk guitar riff and then sampling it, looping it, and having that as the consistent pattern through a piece of music.
