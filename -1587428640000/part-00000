In 1978 [[Fenosa]] the CCLL and the As Encrobas were finally defeated and the mine was built. The other main event of 1977 was the opposition to the [[Nuclear power plant]] of [[Xove]]. That year a hughe movement opposing the construction of the plant started. CCLL and [[ADEGA]] were the main organizars, although the [[Galician National-Popular Bloc]] also played a key role. On 10 April 1977 8,000 people marched from [[Viveiro]] to [[Xove]] against the plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galizacig.gal/actualidade/200704/mm_marcha_contra_xove_nuclear.htm|title=GalizaCig / Actualidade \u2013 Marcha contra Xove nuclear, cando mudou a correlaci\u00f3n de forzas|publisher=Galizacig.gal|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> The struggle against the [[nuclear power plant]] continued until 1979 when, due to the popular pressure (including another [[Anti-nuclear movement|Anti-nuclear March]] with 20,000 participants), the electric company decided not to build the plant there.\n\nIn 1978 elections to the C\u00e1maras Agrarias<ref>The Chambers of Agriculture, were the peasants and farmers were represented in Spain.</ref> CCLL gained 545 representatives in [[Galiza|Galicia]]. The same tear the CCLL launched a campaign against the ''Cuota Empresarial'', the company contribution, an amount of money that the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n farmers had to pay to the [[social security]] despite the small a familiar character of their farms. This tax was considered abusive by the majority of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n farmers at the time. The CCLL supported not paying the tax, which led to a mass [[civil disobedience]] movement against the ''cuota''. After 16 years of protests, in 1994, the [[Spanish government]] abolished the ''cuota''.\n\n===Since 1986: opposition to the CAP and greater organizational independence===\nCCLL was against the entrance of [[Galiza|Galicia]] in the [[European Economic Community|common market]], due to the dismantlement the [[Galiza|Galician]] agrarian productive sectors faced with the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. In fact, milk quotas and new taxes damaged the [[Galiza|Galician]] agrarian sector during the second half of the 80s, which saw the closing of many farms. The struggle against the milk quotas and taxes became the new focus of the CCLL. In 1989 the organization changed its name to Sindicato Labrego Galego-Comisi\u00f3ns Labregas and its acronym to SLG. The same year [[Lidia Senra]] became the leader of the SLG, and remained in that position until 2007.\n\nIn the late 1990s the organization became more independent of the [[Galician People's Union]] and of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]]. The SLG joined [[Via Campesina]] and helped to create the [[anti-globalization movement]] in [[Galiza|Galicia]]. The union also adopted a policy of promoting [[food sovereignty]]. During the 90s the fight against the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] continued, with [[Strike action|work stoppages]], demonstrations and ''tractoradas'' (demonstrations of tractors for the purpose of blockading roads). During the 2000s there was an internal tension between the supporters of the [[Galician People's Union]] (UPG) and the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] and the sector that wanted a fully independent union. In 2009 the supporters of the [[Galician People's Union|UPG]] split and formed a new union, the [[FRUGA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vieiros.com/nova/77407/constituese-a-federacion-rural-galega-baixo-a-presidencia-de-xurxo-alvarez|title=Vieiros|publisher=Vieiros.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galiciahoxe.com/vivir-hoxe-galicia/gh/nace-federacion-rural-galega-alternativa-slg/idNoticia-492222/|title=Nace a Federacin Rural Galega como alternativa SLG|author=Grupo El Correo Gallego|work=Galicia Hoxe \u2013 Noticias en galego a diario|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe SLG has continued to participate in the [[social movements]] since then, being one of the main organizers of the protests against the gold mine in [[Coristanco]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtvg.es/informativos/manifestacion-en-carballo-contra-a-mina-de-corcoesto-567461|title=Noticias de Galicia \u2013 Manifestaci\u00f3n en Carballo contra a mina de Corcoesto \u2013 CRTVG|publisher=Crtvg.es|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/carballo/2013/04/14/manifestacion-multitudinaria-dice-mina-corcoesto/00031365942954901444128.htm?idioma=galego|title=Unha manifestaci\u00f3n multitudinaria di non \u00e1 mina de Corcoesto|author=La Voz de Galicia|work=La Voz de Galicia|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Due to the massive opposition to the project, the [[Xunta de Galicia]] decided not to give the license to the mining company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/galicia/noticia-xunta-dicta-resolucion-denegacion-definitiva-proyecto-mina-corcoesto-20140314175419.html|title=La Xunta dicta resoluci\u00f3n de denegaci\u00f3n definitiva de la mina de Corcoesto|author=Europa Press|date=14 March 2014|work=europapress.es|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* '''Beramendi, J e N\u00fa\u00f1ez Seixas''' (1995): ''O Nacionalismo Galego.''

In 1978 [[Fenosa]] the CCLL and the As Encrobas were finally defeated and the mine was built. The other main event of 1977 was the opposition to the [[Nuclear power plant]] of [[Xove]]. That year a hughe movement opposing the construction of the plant started. CCLL and [[ADEGA]] were the main organizars, although the [[Galician National-Popular Bloc]] also played a key role. On 10 April 1977 8,000 people marched from [[Viveiro]] to [[Xove]] against the plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galizacig.gal/actualidade/200704/mm_marcha_contra_xove_nuclear.htm|title=GalizaCig / Actualidade \u2013 Marcha contra Xove nuclear, cando mudou a correlaci\u00f3n de forzas|publisher=Galizacig.gal|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> The struggle against the [[nuclear power plant]] continued until 1979 when, due to the popular pressure (including another [[Anti-nuclear movement|Anti-nuclear March]] with 20,000 participants), the electric company decided not to build the plant there.\n\nIn 1978 elections to the C\u00e1maras Agrarias<ref>The Chambers of Agriculture, were the peasants and farmers were represented in Spain.</ref> CCLL gained 545 representatives in [[Galiza|Galicia]]. The same tear the CCLL launched a campaign against the ''Cuota Empresarial'', the company contribution, an amount of money that the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n farmers had to pay to the [[social security]] despite the small a familiar character of their farms. This tax was considered abusive by the majority of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n farmers at the time. The CCLL supported not paying the tax, which led to a mass [[civil disobedience]] movement against the ''cuota''. After 16 years of protests, in 1994, the [[Spanish government]] abolished the ''cuota''.\n\n===Since 1986: opposition to the CAP and greater organizational independence===\nCCLL was against the entrance of [[Galiza|Galicia]] in the [[European Economic Community|common market]], due to the dismantlement the [[Galiza|Galician]] agrarian productive sectors faced with the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]. In fact, milk quotas and new taxes damaged the [[Galiza|Galician]] agrarian sector during the second half of the 80s, which saw the closing of many farms. The struggle against the milk quotas and taxes became the new focus of the CCLL. In 1989 the organization changed its name to Sindicato Labrego Galego-Comisi\u00f3ns Labregas and its acronym to SLG. The same year [[Lidia Senra]] became the leader of the SLG, and remained in that position until 2007.\n\nIn the late 1990s the organization became more independent of the [[Galician People's Union]] and of the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]]. The SLG joined [[Via Campesina]] and helped to create the [[anti-globalization movement]] in [[Galiza|Galicia]]. The union also adopted a policy of promoting [[food sovereignty]]. During the 90s the fight against the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] continued, with [[Strike action|work stoppages]], demonstrations and ''tractoradas'' (demonstrations of tractors for the purpose of blockading roads). During the 2000s there was an internal tension between the supporters of the [[Galician People's Union]] (UPG) and the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] and the sector that wanted a fully independent union. In 2009 the supporters of the [[Galician People's Union|UPG]] split and formed a new union, the [[FRUGA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vieiros.com/nova/77407/constituese-a-federacion-rural-galega-baixo-a-presidencia-de-xurxo-alvarez|title=Vieiros|publisher=Vieiros.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galiciahoxe.com/vivir-hoxe-galicia/gh/nace-federacion-rural-galega-alternativa-slg/idNoticia-492222/|title=Nace a Federacin Rural Galega como alternativa SLG|author=Grupo El Correo Gallego|work=Galicia Hoxe \u2013 Noticias en galego a diario|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe SLG has continued to participate in the [[social movements]] since then, being one of the main organizers of the protests against the gold mine in [[Coristanco]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtvg.es/informativos/manifestacion-en-carballo-contra-a-mina-de-corcoesto-567461|title=Noticias de Galicia \u2013 Manifestaci\u00f3n en Carballo contra a mina de Corcoesto \u2013 CRTVG|publisher=Crtvg.es|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/carballo/2013/04/14/manifestacion-multitudinaria-dice-mina-corcoesto/00031365942954901444128.htm?idioma=galego|title=Unha manifestaci\u00f3n multitudinaria di non \u00e1 mina de Corcoesto|author=La Voz de Galicia|work=La Voz de Galicia|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Due to the massive opposition to the project, the [[Xunta de Galicia]] decided not to give the license to the mining company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/galicia/noticia-xunta-dicta-resolucion-denegacion-definitiva-proyecto-mina-corcoesto-20140314175419.html|title=La Xunta dicta resoluci\u00f3n de denegaci\u00f3n definitiva de la mina de Corcoesto|author=Europa Press|date=14 March 2014|work=europapress.es|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* '''Beramendi, J e N\u00fa\u00f1ez Seixas''' (1995): ''O Nacionalismo Galego.''

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond.

The protein is shown as a [[ribbon diagram]], with alpha helices in red, beta sheets in yellow and loops in blue. Generated from [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=7DFR 7DFR].]]\n'''Enzyme kinetics''' is the study of the [[chemical reaction]]s that are [[catalyst|catalysed]] by [[enzymes]]. In enzyme kinetics, the [[reaction rate]] is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in [[metabolism]], how its activity is controlled, and how a [[drug]] or an agonist might [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] the enzyme.\n\nEnzymes are usually [[protein]] [[molecule]]s that manipulate other molecules\u2014the enzymes' [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s. These target molecules bind to an enzyme's [[active site]] and are transformed into [[product (biology)|products]] through a series of steps known as the [[enzyme catalysis|enzymatic mechanism]]\n\n: E + S \u21c4 ES \u21c4 ES* \u21c4 EP \u21c4 E + P\n\nThese mechanisms can be divided into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as [[Triosephosphateisomerase|triosephosphate isomerase]], aim to measure the [[dissociation constant|affinity]] with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).\n\nWhen enzymes bind multiple substrates, such as [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (shown right), enzyme kinetics can also show the sequence in which these substrates bind and the sequence in which products are released.  An example of enzymes that bind a single substrate and release multiple products are [[protease]]s, which cleave one protein substrate into two polypeptide products. Others join two substrates together, such as [[DNA polymerase]] linking a [[nucleotide]] to [[DNA]]. Although these mechanisms are often a complex series of steps, there is typically one ''rate-determining step'' that determines the overall kinetics.  This [[rate-determining step]] may be a chemical reaction or a [[conformational isomerism|conformational]] change of the enzyme or substrates, such as those involved in the release of product(s) from the enzyme.\n\nKnowledge of the [[protein structure|enzyme's structure]] is helpful in interpreting kinetic data.  For example, the structure can suggest how substrates and products bind during catalysis; what changes occur during the reaction; and even the role of particular [[amino acid]] residues in the mechanism.  Some enzymes change shape significantly during the mechanism; in such cases, it is helpful to determine the enzyme structure with and without bound substrate analogues that do not undergo the enzymatic reaction.\n\nNot all biological catalysts are protein enzymes: [[RNA]]-based catalysts such as [[ribozymes]] and [[ribosomes]] are essential to many cellular functions, such as [[splicing (genetics)|RNA splicing]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]]. The main difference between ribozymes and enzymes is that RNA catalysts are composed of nucleotides, whereas enzymes are composed of amino acids.  Ribozymes also perform a more limited set of reactions, although their [[reaction mechanism]]s and kinetics can be analysed and classified by the same methods.\n\n==General principles==\n[[File:KinEnzymo(en).svg|thumb|300px|right|As larger amounts of [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] are added to a reaction, the available enzyme [[binding site]]s become filled to the limit of [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|<math>V_\\max</math>]].  Beyond this limit the enzyme is saturated with substrate and the reaction rate ceases to increase.]]\n\nThe reaction catalysed by an enzyme uses exactly the same reactants and produces exactly the same products as the uncatalysed reaction. Like other [[catalysts]], enzymes do not alter the position of [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between substrates and products.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Wrighton MS, Ebbing DD |title=General chemistry |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-395-63696-1 |edition=4th}}</ref> However, unlike uncatalysed chemical reactions, enzyme-catalysed reactions display saturation kinetics.  For a given enzyme concentration and for relatively low substrate concentrations, the reaction rate increases linearly with substrate concentration; the enzyme molecules are largely free to catalyse the reaction, and increasing substrate concentration means an increasing rate at which the enzyme and substrate molecules encounter one another.  However, at relatively high substrate concentrations, the reaction rate [[asymptote|asymptotically]] approaches the theoretical maximum; the enzyme active sites are almost all occupied by substrates resulting in saturation, and the reaction rate is determined by the intrinsic turnover rate of the enzyme.<ref name=\"Fromm H.J. 2012\">Fromm H.J., Hargrove M.S. (2012) Enzyme Kinetics. In: Essentials of Biochemistry. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg</ref> The substrate concentration midway between these two limiting cases is denoted by ''K''<sub>M</sub>. Thus, ''K''<sub>M</sub> is the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of the maximum velocity.<ref name=\"Fromm H.J. 2012\"/>\n\nThe two most important kinetic properties of an enzyme are how easily the enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate, and the maximum rate it can achieve. Knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can show how the enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions.\n\n==Enzyme assays==\n{{Main|Enzyme assay}}\n[[File:Enzyme progress curve.svg|thumb|250px|left|Progress curve for an enzyme reaction. The slope in the initial rate period is the '''initial rate of reaction''' ''v''.  The [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]] describes how this slope varies with the concentration of substrate.]]\n[[Enzyme assay]]s are laboratory procedures that measure the rate of enzyme reactions. Since enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse, enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction. There are many methods of measurement. [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|Spectrophotometric]] assays observe change in the [[absorbance]] of light between products and reactants; radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of [[radioactivity]] to measure the amount of product made over time. Spectrophotometric assays are most convenient since they allow the rate of the reaction to be measured continuously. Although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples (i.e., they are discontinuous assays) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Danson M, Eisenthal R |title=Enzyme assays: a practical approach |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-963820-8 }}</ref>  An analogous approach is to use [[mass spectrometry]] to monitor the incorporation or release of [[stable isotope]]s as substrate is converted into product.\n\nThe most sensitive enzyme assays use [[laser]]s focused through a [[microscope]] to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use changes in the [[fluorescence]] of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of [[fluorescent dyes]] added onto specific sites of the [[protein]] to report movements that occur during catalysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie XS, Lu HP | title = Single-molecule enzymology | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 23 | pages = 15967\u201370 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10347141 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.23.15967 | doi-access = free }}</ref> These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu HP | title = Single-molecule spectroscopy studies of conformational change dynamics in enzymatic reactions | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 261\u20139 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15180547 | doi = 10.2174/1389201043376887 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnell JR, Dyson HJ, Wright PE|authorlink2=Jane Dyson | title = Structure, dynamics, and catalytic function of dihydrofolate reductase | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics and Biomolecular Structure | volume = 33 | pages = 119\u201340 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15139807 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.33.110502.133613 }}</ref>\n\nAn example progress curve for an enzyme assay is shown above. The enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear for a short period after the start of the reaction.  As the reaction proceeds and substrate is consumed, the rate continuously slows (so long as substrate is not still at saturating levels). To measure the initial (and maximal) rate, enzyme assays are typically carried out while the reaction has progressed only a few percent towards total completion.  The length of the initial rate period depends on the assay conditions and can range from milliseconds to hours.  However, equipment for rapidly mixing liquids allows fast kinetic measurements on initial rates of less than one second.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gibson QH |title=Rapid mixing: Stopped flow |volume=16 |pages=187\u2013228 |year=1969 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(69)16009-7 |isbn=978-0-12-181873-9|series=Methods in Enzymology |chapter=&#91;6&#93; Rapid mixing: Stopped flow }}</ref> These very rapid assays are essential for measuring pre-steady-state kinetics, which are discussed below.\n\nMost enzyme kinetics studies concentrate on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, it is also possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear [[rate equation]]. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis.<ref>{{cite book|author=Duggleby RG |title=Analysis of enzyme progress curves by non-linear regression |volume=249 |pages=61\u201390 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(95)49031-0 |pmid=7791628 |isbn=978-0-12-182150-0|series=Methods in Enzymology |chapter=&#91;3&#93; Analysis of enzyme progress curves by nonlinear regression }}</ref> This approach is useful as an alternative to [[rapid kinetics]] when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.\n\n==Single-substrate reactions==\nEnzymes with single-substrate mechanisms include [[isomerase]]s such as [[triosephosphateisomerase]] or [[bisphosphoglycerate mutase]], intramolecular [[lyase]]s such as [[adenylate cyclase]] and the [[hammerhead ribozyme]], an RNA lyase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray JB, Dunham CM, Scott WG | title = A pH-dependent conformational change, rather than the chemical step, appears to be rate-limiting in the hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 315 | issue = 2 | pages = 121\u201330 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11779233 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2001.5145 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83b54719f413d6e496d35a32ac85ba9d571d4633 }}</ref> However, some enzymes that only have a single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. [[Catalase]] is an example of this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of [[hydrogen peroxide]] substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping\u2013pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the ''Multi-substrate reactions'' section below.\n\n===Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics===\n{{multiple image\n | direction= vertical\n | width    = 325\n | footer   =\n\n | image1   = Enzyme mechanism 2.svg\n | alt1     = Schematic reaction diagrams for uncatalzyed (Substrate to Product) and catalyzed (Enzyme + Substrate to Enzyme/Substrate complex to Enzyme + Product)\n | caption1 = A chemical reaction mechanism with or without [[enzyme catalysis]].

If the initial rate of the reaction is measured over a range of substrate concentrations (denoted as [S]), the initial reaction rate (<math>v_0</math>) increases as [S] increases, as shown on the right. However, as [S] gets higher, the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate and the initial rate reaches ''V''<sub>max</sub>, the enzyme's maximum rate.\n\nThe [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetic model of a single-substrate reaction]] is shown on the right. There is an initial [[chemical kinetics|bimolecular reaction]] between the enzyme E and substrate S to form the enzyme\u2013substrate complex ES. The rate of enzymatic reaction increases with the increase of the substrate concentration up to a certain level called V<sub>max</sub>; at V<sub>max</sub>, increase in substrate concentration does not cause any increase in reaction rate as there is no more enzyme (E) available for reacting with substrate (S). Here, the rate of reaction becomes dependent on the ES complex and the reaction becomes a [[chemical kinetics|unimolecular reaction]] <nowiki/>with an order of zero. Though the enzymatic mechanism for the [[chemical kinetics|unimolecular reaction]] <small><chem> ES ->[k_{cat}] E + P </chem></small> can be quite complex, there is typically one rate-determining enzymatic step that allows this reaction to be modelled as a single catalytic step with an apparent unimolecular rate constant ''k''<sub>cat</sub>.\nIf the reaction path proceeds over one or several intermediates, ''k''<sub>cat</sub> will be a function of several elementary rate constants, whereas in the simplest case of a single elementary reaction (e.g. no intermediates) it will be identical to the elementary unimolecular rate constant ''k''<sub>2</sub>. The apparent unimolecular rate constant ''k''<sub>cat</sub> is also called ''turnover number'' and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.\n\nThe [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]]<ref>Michaelis L. and Menten M.L. ''Kinetik der Invertinwirkung'' Biochem. Z. 1913; 49:333\u2013369 [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/menten.html English translation] Accessed 6 April 2007</ref> describes how the (initial) reaction rate ''v''<sub>0</sub> depends on the position of the substrate-binding [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] and the rate constant ''k''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n:<math chem> v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max}[\\ce{S}]}{K_M + [\\ce{S}]} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''(Michaelis\u2013Menten equation)''\nwith the constants\n:<math chem> \\begin{align} \nK_M \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\frac{k_{2} + k_{-1}}{k_{1}} \\approx K_D\\\\\nV_\\max \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   k_{cat}\\ce{[E]}_{tot}\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nThis Michaelis\u2013Menten equation is the basis for most single-substrate enzyme kinetics. Two  crucial assumptions underlie this equation (apart from the general assumption about the mechanism only involving no intermediate or product inhibition, and there is no [[Allosteric regulation|allostericity]] or [[Cooperative binding|cooperativity]]). The first assumption is  the so-called \n[[steady state (chemistry)|quasi-steady-state assumption]] (or pseudo-steady-state hypothesis), namely that the concentration of the substrate-bound enzyme (and hence also the unbound enzyme) changes much more slowly than those of the product and substrate and thus the change over time of the complex can be set to zero\n<math chem> d\\ce{[ES]}/{dt}  \\; \\overset{!} = \\;0 </math>. The second assumption is that the total enzyme concentration does not change over time, thus <math chem> \\ce{[E]}_\\text{tot} = \\ce{[E]} + \\ce{[ES]}  \\; \\overset{!} = \\; \\text{const} </math>.\nA complete derivation can be found [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics#Equation|here]].\n\nThe Michaelis constant ''K''<sub>M</sub> is experimentally defined as the concentration at which the rate of the enzyme reaction is half ''V''<sub>max</sub>, which can be verified by substituting [S] = ''K''<sub>M</sub> into the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation and can also be seen graphically. If the rate-determining enzymatic step is slow compared to substrate dissociation (<math>k_2 \\ll k_{-1} </math>), the Michaelis constant ''K''<sub>M</sub> is roughly the [[dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>D</sub> of the ES complex.\n\nIf <chem>[S]</chem> is small compared to <math>K_M</math> then the term <math chem>[\\ce S] / (K_M + [\\ce S]) \\approx [\\ce S] / K_M </math> and also very little ES complex is formed, thus <chem>[E]_{\\rm tot} \\approx [E]</chem>.  Therefore, the rate of product formation is\n:<math chem>v_0 \\approx  \\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M} \\ce{[E] [S]} \\qquad \\qquad \\text{if } [\\ce S] \\ll K_M</math>\nThus the product formation rate depends on the enzyme concentration as well as on the substrate concentration, the equation resembles a bimolecular reaction with a corresponding pseudo-second order rate constant <math>k_2 / K_M</math>. This constant is a measure of [[catalytic efficiency]].

Firstly, it helps explain how enzymes work, and secondly, it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, ''K''<sub>M</sub> and ''V''<sub>max</sub>, are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control [[metabolism]].\n\nMaking these predictions is not trivial, even for simple systems. For example, [[oxaloacetate]] is formed by [[malate dehydrogenase]] within the [[mitochondrion]]. Oxaloacetate can then be consumed by [[citrate synthase]], [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]] or [[aspartate aminotransferase]], feeding into the [[citric acid cycle]], [[gluconeogenesis]] or [[aspartic acid]] biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate as well as the concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and [[gene expression]] data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called [[flux balance analysis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Almaas E, Kov\u00e1cs B, Vicsek T, Oltvai ZN, Barab\u00e1si AL | title = Global organization of metabolic fluxes in the bacterium Escherichia coli | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6977 | pages = 839\u201343 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14985762 | doi = 10.1038/nature02289 | arxiv = q-bio/0403001 | bibcode = 2004Natur.427..839A }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reed JL, Vo TD, Schilling CH, Palsson BO | title = An expanded genome-scale model of Escherichia coli K-12 (iJR904 GSM/GPR) | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = R54 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12952533 | pmc = 193654 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2003-4-9-r54 }}</ref>\n\n===Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics with intermediate===\nOne could also consider the less simple case\n: <chem> \n {E} + S \n   <=>[k_{1}][k_{-1}]\n ES\n   ->[k_2]\n EI\n   ->[k_3]\n {E} + P\n</chem>\nwhere a complex with the enzyme and an intermediate exists and the intermediate is converted into product in a second step.

The analysis of these reactions is much simpler if the concentration of substrate A is kept constant and substrate B varied. Under these conditions, the enzyme behaves just like a single-substrate enzyme and a plot of ''v'' by [S] gives apparent ''K''<sub>M</sub> and ''V''<sub>max</sub> constants for substrate B. If a set of these measurements is performed at different fixed concentrations of A, these data can be used to work out what the mechanism of the reaction is. For an enzyme that takes two substrates A and B and turns them into two products P and Q, there are two types of mechanism: ternary complex and ping\u2013pong.\n\n===Ternary-complex mechanisms===\n[[File:Random order ternary mechanism.svg|thumb|310px|right|Random-order ternary-complex mechanism for an enzyme reaction. The reaction path is shown as a line and enzyme intermediates containing substrates A and B or products P and Q are written below the line.]]\n\nIn these enzymes, both substrates bind to the enzyme at the same time to produce an EAB ternary complex. The order of binding can either be random (in a random mechanism) or substrates have to bind in a particular sequence (in an ordered mechanism).

The kinetic approaches discussed above will show at what rates [[Reactive intermediate|intermediates]] are formed and inter-converted, but they cannot identify exactly what these intermediates are.\n\nKinetic measurements taken under various solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often shed light on this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the breaking of a [[covalent bond]] to a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by [[deuterium]], its stable [[isotope]]. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary [[kinetic isotope effect]], which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleland WW | title = The use of isotope effects to determine enzyme mechanisms | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 433 | issue = 1 | pages = 2\u201312 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15581561 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2004.08.027 }}</ref> It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O, but these effects are more subtle.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Northrop DB | title = The expression of isotope effects on enzyme-catalyzed reactions | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 50 | pages = 103\u201331 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7023356 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.50.070181.000535 }}</ref>\n\nIsotopes can also be used to reveal the fate of various parts of the substrate molecules in the final products.

These interactions can be either ''reversible'' (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity) or ''irreversible'' (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme).\n\n===Reversible inhibitors===\nTraditionally reversible enzyme inhibitors have been classified as competitive, uncompetitive, or non-competitive, according to their effects on ''K''<sub>M</sub> and ''V''<sub>max</sub>. These different effects result from the inhibitor binding to the enzyme E, to the enzyme\u2013substrate complex ES, or to both, respectively.  The division of these classes arises from a problem in their derivation and results in the need to use two different binding constants for one binding event.  The binding of an inhibitor and its effect on the enzymatic activity are two distinctly different things, another problem the traditional equations fail to acknowledge. In noncompetitive inhibition the binding of the inhibitor results in 100% inhibition of the enzyme only, and fails to consider the possibility of anything in between.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh R, Martin E, Darvesh S | title = Limitations of conventional inhibitor classifications | journal = Integrative Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = 1197\u2013201 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22038120 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1039/c1ib00053e }}</ref>  In noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor will bind to an enzyme at its allosteric site; therefore, the binding affinity, or inverse of ''K''<sub>M</sub>, of the substrate with the enzyme will remain the same. On the other hand, the Vmax will decrease relative to an uninhibited enzyme. On a Lineweaver-Burk plot, the presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor is illustrated by a change in the y-intercept, defined as 1/Vmax. The x-intercept, defined as \u22121/''K''<sub>M</sub>, will remain the same. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor will bind to an enzyme at the active site, competing with the substrate. As a result, the ''K''<sub>M</sub> will increase and the Vmax will remain the same.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleland WW | title = The kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions with two or more substrates or products.

To demonstrate the relationship the following rearrangement can be made:\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{V_\\max}{1 + \\cfrac{[I]}{K_i}} \n=\n\\cfrac{V_\\max}{\\cfrac{[I]+K_i}{K_i}} </math>\n\nAdding zero to the bottom ([I]-[I])\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{V_\\max}{\\cfrac{[I]+K_i}{[I]+K_i-[I]}} </math>\n\nDividing by [I]+K<sub>i</sub>\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{V_\\max}{\\cfrac{1}{1 - \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i}}}\n=\nV_\\max - V_\\max \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i} </math>\n\nThis notation demonstrates that similar to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation, where the rate of reaction depends on the percent of the enzyme population interacting with substrate, the effect of the inhibitor is a result of the percent of the enzyme population interacting with inhibitor.  The only problem with this equation in its present form is that it assumes absolute inhibition of the enzyme with inhibitor binding, when in fact there can be a wide range of effects anywhere from 100% inhibition of substrate turn over to just >0%.  To account for this the equation can be easily modified to allow for different degrees of inhibition by including a delta ''V''<sub>max</sub> term.\n\n:<math>V_\\max - \\Delta V_\\max \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i} </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>V_{\\max1} -  (V_{\\max1} - V_{\\max2} ) \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i} </math>\n\nThis term can then define the residual enzymatic activity present when the inhibitor is interacting with individual enzymes in the population.  However the inclusion of this term has the added value of allowing for the possibility of activation if the secondary ''V''<sub>max</sub> term turns out to be higher than the initial term. To account for the possibly of activation as well the notation can then be rewritten replacing the inhibitor \"I\" with a modifier term denoted here as \"X\".\n\n:<math>V_{\\max1} -  (V_{\\max1} - V_{\\max2} ) \\cfrac{[X]}{[X]+K_x} </math>\n\nWhile this terminology results in a simplified way of dealing with kinetic effects relating to the maximum velocity of the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation, it highlights potential problems with the term used to describe effects relating to the ''K''<sub>M</sub>.  The ''K''<sub>M</sub> relating to the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate should in most cases relate to potential changes in the binding site of the enzyme which would directly result from enzyme inhibitor interactions.

These reactions, which may be called suicide substrates, follow [[exponential decay]] functions and are usually saturable. Below saturation, they follow [[reaction rate|first order]] kinetics with respect to inhibitor. Irreversible inhibition could be classified into two distinct types. Affinity labelling is a type of irreversible inhibition where a functional group that is highly reactive modifies a catalytically critical residue on the protein of interest to bring about inhibition.  Mechanism-based inhibition, on the other hand, involves binding of the inhibitor followed by enzyme mediated alterations that transform the latter into a reactive group that irreversibly modifies the enzyme.\n\n=== Philosophical discourse on reversibility and irreversibility of inhibition ===\nHaving discussed reversible inhibition and irreversible inhibition in the above two headings, it would have to be pointed out that the concept of reversibility (or irreversibility) is a purely theoretical construct exclusively dependent on the time-frame of the assay, i.e., a reversible assay involving association and dissociation of the inhibitor molecule in the minute timescales would seem irreversible if an assay assess the outcome in the seconds and vice versa. There is a continuum of inhibitor behaviors spanning reversibility and irreversibility at a given non-arbitrary assay time frame.

In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. The kinetics of many enzymes is adequately described by the simple Michaelis-Menten model, but all enzymes have [[protein dynamics|internal motions]] that are not accounted for in the model and can have significant contributions to the overall reaction kinetics.

Generated from [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=7DFR 7DFR].]]\n'''Enzyme kinetics''' is the study of the [[chemical reaction]]s that are [[catalyst|catalysed]] by [[enzymes]]. In enzyme kinetics, the [[reaction rate]] is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in [[metabolism]], how its activity is controlled, and how a [[drug]] or an agonist might [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] the enzyme.\n\nEnzymes are usually [[protein]] [[molecule]]s that manipulate other molecules\u2014the enzymes' [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s. These target molecules bind to an enzyme's [[active site]] and are transformed into [[product (biology)|products]] through a series of steps known as the [[enzyme catalysis|enzymatic mechanism]]\n\n: E + S \u21c4 ES \u21c4 ES* \u21c4 EP \u21c4 E + P\n\nThese mechanisms can be divided into single-substrate and multiple-substrate mechanisms. Kinetic studies on enzymes that only bind one substrate, such as [[Triosephosphateisomerase|triosephosphate isomerase]], aim to measure the [[dissociation constant|affinity]] with which the enzyme binds this substrate and the turnover rate. Some other examples of enzymes are phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, both of which are important for cellular respiration (glycolysis).\n\nWhen enzymes bind multiple substrates, such as [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (shown right), enzyme kinetics can also show the sequence in which these substrates bind and the sequence in which products are released.  An example of enzymes that bind a single substrate and release multiple products are [[protease]]s, which cleave one protein substrate into two polypeptide products. Others join two substrates together, such as [[DNA polymerase]] linking a [[nucleotide]] to [[DNA]]. Although these mechanisms are often a complex series of steps, there is typically one ''rate-determining step'' that determines the overall kinetics.  This [[rate-determining step]] may be a chemical reaction or a [[conformational isomerism|conformational]] change of the enzyme or substrates, such as those involved in the release of product(s) from the enzyme.\n\nKnowledge of the [[protein structure|enzyme's structure]] is helpful in interpreting kinetic data.  For example, the structure can suggest how substrates and products bind during catalysis; what changes occur during the reaction; and even the role of particular [[amino acid]] residues in the mechanism.  Some enzymes change shape significantly during the mechanism; in such cases, it is helpful to determine the enzyme structure with and without bound substrate analogues that do not undergo the enzymatic reaction.\n\nNot all biological catalysts are protein enzymes: [[RNA]]-based catalysts such as [[ribozymes]] and [[ribosomes]] are essential to many cellular functions, such as [[splicing (genetics)|RNA splicing]] and [[translation (biology)|translation]]. The main difference between ribozymes and enzymes is that RNA catalysts are composed of nucleotides, whereas enzymes are composed of amino acids.  Ribozymes also perform a more limited set of reactions, although their [[reaction mechanism]]s and kinetics can be analysed and classified by the same methods.\n\n==General principles==\n[[File:KinEnzymo(en).svg|thumb|300px|right|As larger amounts of [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] are added to a reaction, the available enzyme [[binding site]]s become filled to the limit of [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|<math>V_\\max</math>]].  Beyond this limit the enzyme is saturated with substrate and the reaction rate ceases to increase.]]\n\nThe reaction catalysed by an enzyme uses exactly the same reactants and produces exactly the same products as the uncatalysed reaction. Like other [[catalysts]], enzymes do not alter the position of [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between substrates and products.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Wrighton MS, Ebbing DD |title=General chemistry |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-395-63696-1 |edition=4th}}</ref> However, unlike uncatalysed chemical reactions, enzyme-catalysed reactions display saturation kinetics.  For a given enzyme concentration and for relatively low substrate concentrations, the reaction rate increases linearly with substrate concentration; the enzyme molecules are largely free to catalyse the reaction, and increasing substrate concentration means an increasing rate at which the enzyme and substrate molecules encounter one another.  However, at relatively high substrate concentrations, the reaction rate [[asymptote|asymptotically]] approaches the theoretical maximum; the enzyme active sites are almost all occupied by substrates resulting in saturation, and the reaction rate is determined by the intrinsic turnover rate of the enzyme.<ref name=\"Fromm H.J. 2012\">Fromm H.J., Hargrove M.S. (2012) Enzyme Kinetics. In: Essentials of Biochemistry. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg</ref> The substrate concentration midway between these two limiting cases is denoted by ''K''<sub>M</sub>. Thus, ''K''<sub>M</sub> is the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of the maximum velocity.<ref name=\"Fromm H.J. 2012\"/>\n\nThe two most important kinetic properties of an enzyme are how easily the enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate, and the maximum rate it can achieve. Knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can show how the enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions.\n\n==Enzyme assays==\n{{Main|Enzyme assay}}\n[[File:Enzyme progress curve.svg|thumb|250px|left|Progress curve for an enzyme reaction. The slope in the initial rate period is the '''initial rate of reaction''' ''v''.  The [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]] describes how this slope varies with the concentration of substrate.]]\n[[Enzyme assay]]s are laboratory procedures that measure the rate of enzyme reactions. Since enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse, enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction. There are many methods of measurement. [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|Spectrophotometric]] assays observe change in the [[absorbance]] of light between products and reactants; radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of [[radioactivity]] to measure the amount of product made over time. Spectrophotometric assays are most convenient since they allow the rate of the reaction to be measured continuously. Although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples (i.e., they are discontinuous assays) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Danson M, Eisenthal R |title=Enzyme assays: a practical approach |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-963820-8 }}</ref>  An analogous approach is to use [[mass spectrometry]] to monitor the incorporation or release of [[stable isotope]]s as substrate is converted into product.\n\nThe most sensitive enzyme assays use [[laser]]s focused through a [[microscope]] to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use changes in the [[fluorescence]] of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of [[fluorescent dyes]] added onto specific sites of the [[protein]] to report movements that occur during catalysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie XS, Lu HP | title = Single-molecule enzymology | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 23 | pages = 15967\u201370 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10347141 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.23.15967 | doi-access = free }}</ref> These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu HP | title = Single-molecule spectroscopy studies of conformational change dynamics in enzymatic reactions | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 261\u20139 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15180547 | doi = 10.2174/1389201043376887 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnell JR, Dyson HJ, Wright PE|authorlink2=Jane Dyson | title = Structure, dynamics, and catalytic function of dihydrofolate reductase | journal = Annual Review of Biophysics and Biomolecular Structure | volume = 33 | pages = 119\u201340 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15139807 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biophys.33.110502.133613 }}</ref>\n\nAn example progress curve for an enzyme assay is shown above. The enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear for a short period after the start of the reaction.  As the reaction proceeds and substrate is consumed, the rate continuously slows (so long as substrate is not still at saturating levels). To measure the initial (and maximal) rate, enzyme assays are typically carried out while the reaction has progressed only a few percent towards total completion.  The length of the initial rate period depends on the assay conditions and can range from milliseconds to hours.  However, equipment for rapidly mixing liquids allows fast kinetic measurements on initial rates of less than one second.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gibson QH |title=Rapid mixing: Stopped flow |volume=16 |pages=187\u2013228 |year=1969 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(69)16009-7 |isbn=978-0-12-181873-9|series=Methods in Enzymology |chapter=&#91;6&#93; Rapid mixing: Stopped flow }}</ref> These very rapid assays are essential for measuring pre-steady-state kinetics, which are discussed below.\n\nMost enzyme kinetics studies concentrate on this initial, approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, it is also possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear [[rate equation]]. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis.<ref>{{cite book|author=Duggleby RG |title=Analysis of enzyme progress curves by non-linear regression |volume=249 |pages=61\u201390 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(95)49031-0 |pmid=7791628 |isbn=978-0-12-182150-0|series=Methods in Enzymology |chapter=&#91;3&#93; Analysis of enzyme progress curves by nonlinear regression }}</ref> This approach is useful as an alternative to [[rapid kinetics]] when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.\n\n==Single-substrate reactions==\nEnzymes with single-substrate mechanisms include [[isomerase]]s such as [[triosephosphateisomerase]] or [[bisphosphoglycerate mutase]], intramolecular [[lyase]]s such as [[adenylate cyclase]] and the [[ribozyme|hammerhead ribozyme]], an RNA lyase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray JB, Dunham CM, Scott WG | title = A pH-dependent conformational change, rather than the chemical step, appears to be rate-limiting in the hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 315 | issue = 2 | pages = 121\u201330 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11779233 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.2001.5145 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83b54719f413d6e496d35a32ac85ba9d571d4633 }}</ref> However, some enzymes that only have a single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. [[Catalase]] is an example of this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of [[hydrogen peroxide]] substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping\u2013pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the ''Multi-substrate reactions'' section below.\n\n===Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics===\n{{multiple image\n | direction= vertical\n | width    = 325\n | footer   =\n\n | image1   = Enzyme mechanism 2.svg\n | alt1     = Schematic reaction diagrams for uncatalzyed (Substrate to Product) and catalyzed (Enzyme + Substrate to Enzyme/Substrate complex to Enzyme + Product)\n | caption1 = A chemical reaction mechanism with or without [[enzyme catalysis]].

If the initial rate of the reaction is measured over a range of substrate concentrations (denoted as [S]), the initial reaction rate (<math>v_0</math>) increases as [S] increases, as shown on the right. However, as [S] gets higher, the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate and the initial rate reaches ''V''<sub>max</sub>, the enzyme's maximum rate.\n\nThe [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetic model of a single-substrate reaction]] is shown on the right. There is an initial [[chemical kinetics|bimolecular reaction]] between the enzyme E and substrate S to form the enzyme\u2013substrate complex ES. The rate of enzymatic reaction increases with the increase of the substrate concentration up to a certain level called V<sub>max</sub>; at V<sub>max</sub>, increase in substrate concentration does not cause any increase in reaction rate as there is no more enzyme (E) available for reacting with substrate (S). Here, the rate of reaction becomes dependent on the ES complex and the reaction becomes a [[chemical kinetics|unimolecular reaction]] <nowiki/>with an order of zero. Though the enzymatic mechanism for the [[chemical kinetics|unimolecular reaction]] <small><chem> ES ->[k_{cat}] E + P </chem></small> can be quite complex, there is typically one rate-determining enzymatic step that allows this reaction to be modelled as a single catalytic step with an apparent unimolecular rate constant ''k''<sub>cat</sub>.\nIf the reaction path proceeds over one or several intermediates, ''k''<sub>cat</sub> will be a function of several elementary rate constants, whereas in the simplest case of a single elementary reaction (e.g. no intermediates) it will be identical to the elementary unimolecular rate constant ''k''<sub>2</sub>. The apparent unimolecular rate constant ''k''<sub>cat</sub> is also called ''turnover number'' and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.\n\nThe [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics|Michaelis\u2013Menten equation]]<ref>Michaelis L. and Menten M.L. ''Kinetik der Invertinwirkung'' Biochem. Z. 1913; 49:333\u2013369 [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/menten.html English translation] Accessed 6 April 2007</ref> describes how the (initial) reaction rate ''v''<sub>0</sub> depends on the position of the substrate-binding [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] and the rate constant ''k''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n:<math chem> v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max}[\\ce{S}]}{K_M + [\\ce{S}]} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''(Michaelis\u2013Menten equation)''\nwith the constants\n:<math chem> \\begin{align} \nK_M \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\frac{k_{2} + k_{-1}}{k_{1}} \\approx K_D\\\\\nV_\\max \\ &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   k_{cat}\\ce{[E]}_{tot}\n\\end{align} </math>\n\nThis Michaelis\u2013Menten equation is the basis for most single-substrate enzyme kinetics. Two  crucial assumptions underlie this equation (apart from the general assumption about the mechanism only involving no intermediate or product inhibition, and there is no [[Allosteric regulation|allostericity]] or [[Cooperative binding|cooperativity]]). The first assumption is  the so-called \n[[steady state (chemistry)|quasi-steady-state assumption]] (or pseudo-steady-state hypothesis), namely that the concentration of the substrate-bound enzyme (and hence also the unbound enzyme) changes much more slowly than those of the product and substrate and thus the change over time of the complex can be set to zero\n<math chem> d\\ce{[ES]}/{dt}  \\; \\overset{!} = \\;0 </math>. The second assumption is that the total enzyme concentration does not change over time, thus <math chem> \\ce{[E]}_\\text{tot} = \\ce{[E]} + \\ce{[ES]}  \\; \\overset{!} = \\; \\text{const} </math>.\nA complete derivation can be found [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics#Equation|here]].\n\nThe Michaelis constant ''K''<sub>M</sub> is experimentally defined as the concentration at which the rate of the enzyme reaction is half ''V''<sub>max</sub>, which can be verified by substituting [S] = ''K''<sub>M</sub> into the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation and can also be seen graphically. If the rate-determining enzymatic step is slow compared to substrate dissociation (<math>k_2 \\ll k_{-1} </math>), the Michaelis constant ''K''<sub>M</sub> is roughly the [[dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>D</sub> of the ES complex.\n\nIf <chem>[S]</chem> is small compared to <math>K_M</math> then the term <math chem>[\\ce S] / (K_M + [\\ce S]) \\approx [\\ce S] / K_M </math> and also very little ES complex is formed, thus <chem>[E]_{\\rm tot} \\approx [E]</chem>.  Therefore, the rate of product formation is\n:<math chem>v_0 \\approx  \\frac{k_{cat}}{K_M} \\ce{[E] [S]} \\qquad \\qquad \\text{if } [\\ce S] \\ll K_M</math>\nThus the product formation rate depends on the enzyme concentration as well as on the substrate concentration, the equation resembles a bimolecular reaction with a corresponding pseudo-second order rate constant <math>k_2 / K_M</math>. This constant is a measure of [[catalytic efficiency]].

Firstly, it helps explain how enzymes work, and secondly, it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, ''K''<sub>M</sub> and ''V''<sub>max</sub>, are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control [[metabolism]].\n\nMaking these predictions is not trivial, even for simple systems. For example, [[oxaloacetate]] is formed by [[malate dehydrogenase]] within the [[mitochondrion]]. Oxaloacetate can then be consumed by [[citrate synthase]], [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]] or [[aspartate aminotransferase]], feeding into the [[citric acid cycle]], [[gluconeogenesis]] or [[aspartic acid]] biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate as well as the concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and [[gene expression]] data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called [[flux balance analysis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Almaas E, Kov\u00e1cs B, Vicsek T, Oltvai ZN, Barab\u00e1si AL | title = Global organization of metabolic fluxes in the bacterium Escherichia coli | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6977 | pages = 839\u201343 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14985762 | doi = 10.1038/nature02289 | arxiv = q-bio/0403001 | bibcode = 2004Natur.427..839A }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reed JL, Vo TD, Schilling CH, Palsson BO | title = An expanded genome-scale model of Escherichia coli K-12 (iJR904 GSM/GPR) | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = R54 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12952533 | pmc = 193654 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2003-4-9-r54 }}</ref>\n\n===Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics with intermediate===\nOne could also consider the less simple case\n: <chem> \n {E} + S \n   <=>[k_{1}][k_{-1}]\n ES\n   ->[k_2]\n EI\n   ->[k_3]\n {E} + P\n</chem>\nwhere a complex with the enzyme and an intermediate exists and the intermediate is converted into product in a second step.

The analysis of these reactions is much simpler if the concentration of substrate A is kept constant and substrate B varied. Under these conditions, the enzyme behaves just like a single-substrate enzyme and a plot of ''v'' by [S] gives apparent ''K''<sub>M</sub> and ''V''<sub>max</sub> constants for substrate B. If a set of these measurements is performed at different fixed concentrations of A, these data can be used to work out what the mechanism of the reaction is. For an enzyme that takes two substrates A and B and turns them into two products P and Q, there are two types of mechanism: ternary complex and ping\u2013pong.\n\n===Ternary-complex mechanisms===\n[[File:Random order ternary mechanism.svg|thumb|310px|right|Random-order ternary-complex mechanism for an enzyme reaction. The reaction path is shown as a line and enzyme intermediates containing substrates A and B or products P and Q are written below the line.]]\n\nIn these enzymes, both substrates bind to the enzyme at the same time to produce an EAB ternary complex. The order of binding can either be random (in a random mechanism) or substrates have to bind in a particular sequence (in an ordered mechanism).

On a Lineweaver-Burk plot, the presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor is illustrated by a change in the y-intercept, defined as 1/Vmax. The x-intercept, defined as \u22121/''K''<sub>M</sub>, will remain the same. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor will bind to an enzyme at the active site, competing with the substrate. As a result, the ''K''<sub>M</sub> will increase and the Vmax will remain the same.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cleland WW | title = The kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions with two or more substrates or products.

To demonstrate the relationship the following rearrangement can be made:\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{V_\\max}{1 + \\cfrac{[I]}{K_i}} \n=\n\\cfrac{V_\\max}{\\cfrac{[I]+K_i}{K_i}} </math>\n\nAdding zero to the bottom ([I]-[I])\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{V_\\max}{\\cfrac{[I]+K_i}{[I]+K_i-[I]}} </math>\n\nDividing by [I]+K<sub>i</sub>\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{V_\\max}{\\cfrac{1}{1 - \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i}}}\n=\nV_\\max - V_\\max \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i} </math>\n\nThis notation demonstrates that similar to the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation, where the rate of reaction depends on the percent of the enzyme population interacting with substrate, the effect of the inhibitor is a result of the percent of the enzyme population interacting with inhibitor.  The only problem with this equation in its present form is that it assumes absolute inhibition of the enzyme with inhibitor binding, when in fact there can be a wide range of effects anywhere from 100% inhibition of substrate turn over to just >0%.  To account for this the equation can be easily modified to allow for different degrees of inhibition by including a delta ''V''<sub>max</sub> term.\n\n:<math>V_\\max - \\Delta V_\\max \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i} </math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>V_{\\max1} -  (V_{\\max1} - V_{\\max2} ) \\cfrac{[I]}{[I]+K_i} </math>\n\nThis term can then define the residual enzymatic activity present when the inhibitor is interacting with individual enzymes in the population.  However the inclusion of this term has the added value of allowing for the possibility of activation if the secondary ''V''<sub>max</sub> term turns out to be higher than the initial term. To account for the possibly of activation as well the notation can then be rewritten replacing the inhibitor \"I\" with a modifier term denoted here as \"X\".\n\n:<math>V_{\\max1} -  (V_{\\max1} - V_{\\max2} ) \\cfrac{[X]}{[X]+K_x} </math>\n\nWhile this terminology results in a simplified way of dealing with kinetic effects relating to the maximum velocity of the Michaelis\u2013Menten equation, it highlights potential problems with the term used to describe effects relating to the ''K''<sub>M</sub>.  The ''K''<sub>M</sub> relating to the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate should in most cases relate to potential changes in the binding site of the enzyme which would directly result from enzyme inhibitor interactions.  As such a term similar to the one proposed above to modulate ''V''<sub>max</sub> should be appropriate in most situations:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh R, Martin E, Darvesh S | title = A versatile equation to describe reversible enzyme inhibition and activation kinetics: modeling beta-galactosidase and butyrylcholinesterase | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1770 | issue = 5 | pages = 733\u201346 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17307293 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2007.01.001 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>K_{m1} -  (K_{m1} - K_{m2} ) \\cfrac{[X]}{[X]+K_x} </math>\n\nA few examples of reversible inhibition belonging to the competitive and uncompetitive models have been discussed in the following papers.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan B, Skolnick J | title = Insights into the slow-onset tight-binding inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase: detailed mechanistic characterization of pyrrolo [3,2-f] quinazoline-1,3-diamine and its derivatives as novel tight-binding inhibitors | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 282 | issue = 10 | pages = 1922\u201338 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25703118 | pmc = 4445455 | doi = 10.1111/febs.13244 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan B, Tonddast-Navaei S, Skolnick J | title = Ligand binding studies, preliminary structure-activity relationship and detailed mechanistic characterization of 1-phenyl-6,6-dimethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine derivatives as inhibitors of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase | journal = European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 103 | pages = 600\u201314 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26414808 | pmc = 4610388 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.08.021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan B, Rodrigues JV, Tonddast-Navaei S, Shakhnovich E, Skolnick J | title = Rational Design of Novel Allosteric Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors Showing Antibacterial Effects on Drug-Resistant Escherichia coli Escape Variants | journal = ACS Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1848\u20131857 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28525268 | pmc = 5819740 | doi = 10.1021/acschembio.7b00175 }}</ref>\n\n===Irreversible inhibitors===\nEnzyme inhibitors can also irreversibly inactivate enzymes, usually by covalently modifying active site residues. These reactions, which may be called suicide substrates, follow [[exponential decay]] functions and are usually saturable. Below saturation, they follow [[reaction rate|first order]] kinetics with respect to inhibitor. Irreversible inhibition could be classified into two distinct types. Affinity labelling is a type of irreversible inhibition where a functional group that is highly reactive modifies a catalytically critical residue on the protein of interest to bring about inhibition.  Mechanism-based inhibition, on the other hand, involves binding of the inhibitor followed by enzyme mediated alterations that transform the latter into a reactive group that irreversibly modifies the enzyme.\n\n=== Philosophical discourse on reversibility and irreversibility of inhibition ===\nHaving discussed reversible inhibition and irreversible inhibition in the above two headings, it would have to be pointed out that the concept of reversibility (or irreversibility) is a purely theoretical construct exclusively dependent on the time-frame of the assay, i.e., a reversible assay involving association and dissociation of the inhibitor molecule in the minute timescales would seem irreversible if an assay assess the outcome in the seconds and vice versa. There is a continuum of inhibitor behaviors spanning reversibility and irreversibility at a given non-arbitrary assay time frame.  There are inhibitors that show slow-onset behavior<ref name=\":0\" /> and most of these inhibitors, invariably, also show tight-binding to the protein target of interest.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Mechanisms of catalysis==\n{{Main|Enzyme catalysis}}\n[[File:Activation2 updated.svg|thumb|300px|The energy variation as a function of [[reaction coordinate]] shows the stabilisation of the transition state by an enzyme.]]\n\nThe favoured model for the enzyme\u2013substrate interaction is the induced fit model.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koshland DE | title = Application of a Theory of Enzyme Specificity to Protein Synthesis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 98\u2013104 | date = February 1958 | pmid = 16590179 | pmc = 335371 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.44.2.98 | bibcode = 1958PNAS...44...98K }}</ref> This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce [[conformational change]]s in the enzyme that strengthen binding.

However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping\u2013pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on ''V''<sub>max</sub> but not ''K''<sub>M</sub> might indicate that a residue in the active site needs to be in a particular [[Ionization|ionisation]] state for catalysis to occur.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1902 [[Victor Henri]] proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Henri V | year = 1902 | title = Theorie generale de l'action de quelques diastases|journal=Compt.

In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. The kinetics of many enzymes is adequately described by the simple Michaelis-Menten model, but all enzymes have [[protein dynamics|internal motions]] that are not accounted for in the model and can have significant contributions to the overall reaction kinetics. This can be modeled by introducing several Michaelis-Menten pathways that are connected with fluctuating rates,<ref name=OF_2005>{{cite journal | vauthors = Flomenbom O, Velonia K, Loos D, Masuo S, Cotlet M, Engelborghs Y, Hofkens J, Rowan AE, Nolte RJ, Van der Auweraer M, de Schryver FC, Klafter J | title = Stretched exponential decay and correlations in the catalytic activity of fluctuating single lipase molecules | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 7 | pages = 2368\u201372 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15695587 | pmc = 548972 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409039102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.2368F }}</ref><ref name=English_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = English BP, Min W, van Oijen AM, Lee KT, Luo G, Sun H, Cherayil BJ, Kou SC, Xie XS | title = Ever-fluctuating single enzyme molecules: Michaelis-Menten equation revisited | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 87\u201394 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16415859 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio759 }}</ref><ref name=Lu_1998>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu HP, Xun L, Xie XS | title = Single-molecule enzymatic dynamics | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5395 | pages = 1877\u201382 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9836635 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5395.1877 }}</ref> which is a mathematical extension of the basic Michaelis Menten mechanism.<ref name=XX_2006>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue X, Liu F, Ou-Yang ZC | title = Single molecule Michaelis-Menten equation beyond quasistatic disorder | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 74 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 030902 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17025584 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.74.030902 | arxiv = cond-mat/0604364 | bibcode = 2006PhRvE..74c0902X }}</ref>\n\n==Software==\n\n===ENZO===\n'''ENZO''' (Enzyme Kinetics) is a graphical interface tool for building kinetic models of enzyme catalyzed reactions.

The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645.

In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the [[Archbishop|archbishops]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Seville]]. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing [[Canon (priest)|canon]] by the cathedrals of [[Las Palmas]] (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some [[Diocese|diocesan]] periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the [[Carlism|Carlist]] cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] breed of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].\n\n==Family and youth==\n[[File:Pla\u00e7a de Vic en un dia de mercat (cropped).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Vic]]h, 19th c.]]\nThe ancient [[Catalan People|Catalan]] family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region.

Later Sancha and Sp\u00ednola got to know each other better, and in 1904, during coronation of V\u00edrgen de los Reyes, a great Seville feast engineered by Sp\u00ednola, it was Sancha who performed the act. This conciliatory gesture might be interpreted as some sort of apology on part of Sp\u00ednola, ''ABC'' 04.12.2004, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2004/12/04/018.html here]</ref> it caused a scandal and widespread debate.<ref>during the conflict, lasting for few months between 1899 and 1900, Roca\u2019s \u201cname reverberated across all Spain\u201d, ''ABC'' 04.05.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1943/05/04/006.html here]</ref> As a well-known personality he was then active in Catholic congresses staged in the early 1900s.

They were underpinned by confidence that a community without an officially accepted and enforced orthodoxy, a community where various concepts of public life constantly compete for domination, can not form an orderly, peaceful, operational society. In his view the only appropriate orthodoxy was Catholicism, which for centuries shaped the Spanish self and contributed to greatness of the nation; Catholic principles should serve as guidelines organizing both state and society. Their antithesis was [[liberalism]], not only useless as a political doctrine, but also unacceptable as a moral concept; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and led towards further calamities in the future.<ref> compare excerpts from ''Observaciones'': \u201cLos males que pesan sobre la Iglesia espa\u00f1ola proceden de nuestras Constituciones liberales.

In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the [[Archbishop|archbishops]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Seville]]. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing [[Canon (priest)|canon]] by the cathedrals of [[Las Palmas]] (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some [[Diocese|diocesan]] periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the [[Carlism|Carlist]] cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] breed of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].\n\n==Family and youth==\n[[File:Pla\u00e7a de Vic en un dia de mercat (cropped).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Vic]]h, 19th c.]]\nThe ancient [[Catalan People|Catalan]] family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region.

Their antithesis was [[liberalism]], not only useless as a political doctrine, but also unacceptable as a moral concept; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and led towards further calamities in the future.<ref> compare excerpts from ''Observaciones'': \u201cLos males que pesan sobre la Iglesia espa\u00f1ola proceden de nuestras Constituciones liberales.
