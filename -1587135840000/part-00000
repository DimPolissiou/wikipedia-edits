However, at the last minute Clare Balding is available and turns up at [[Broadcasting House|New Broadcasting House]] as Carol Vorderman is leaving and they have to be kept apart.

Meanwhile, a female ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter has been accused of wearing clothes that are inappropriately watchable. When the name of the programme becomes known as Kneesnight and her legs get their own Twitter account there is a feeling something should be done about it. Flagship series ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' has lost all three of the big-name presenters who were attached to do the show \u2013 so the search continues.

Producer Lucy Freeman chairs a meeting about forthcoming flagship show ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' and the loss of presenter [[Clare Balding]] and her replacement by [[Carol Vorderman]].\n'''Featuring as themselves:''' Carol Vorderman, Clare Balding, [[Alan Yentob]], [[Salman Rushdie]]\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title=Episode 2\n |DirectedBy=John Morton\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|3|26|df=yes}}\n |Aux4=1.94\n |ShortSummary=Fletcher reluctantly takes the train North to [[MediaCityUK#Tenants|BBC Media City]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], for his first big interview in the job by [[Jenni Murray]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4's]] ''[[Woman's Hour]]'' where he hopes to defuse the media storm that has become known as Wingategate. Complications arise for the ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' production team, after having wooed and won Carol Vorderman as [[Clare Balding]]'s replacement to co-present with [[Alan Titchmarsh]]. However, at the last minute Clare Balding is available and turns up at [[Broadcasting House|New Broadcasting House]] as Carol Vorderman is leaving and they have to be kept apart. In Salford Fletcher ignores advisors Sharpe and Pritchard with his own solution to both problems resulting in [[Alan Titchmarsh]] pulling out.\n'''Featuring as themselves:''' Carol Vorderman, Jenni Murray, Clare Balding\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title=Episode 3\n |DirectedBy=John Morton\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|2|df=yes}}\n |Aux4=1.61\n |ShortSummary=Anna Rampton advocates moving ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' to radio, thus freeing up a prime slot for her own series, ''Britain's Tastiest Village''. The debate about the future of the BBC is not helped when Ian Fletcher's salary comes under intense scrutiny in the press. Neil Reid, current Controller of Current Affairs, is having to deal with the fallout from a blunder in [[BBC News]] coverage of the Syrian crisis when a photo of [[Trudie Styler]] was used instead of [[Asma al-Assad]]. Producer Lucy Freeman goes in to pitch ''Home Truth'', a script she's been developing over several years with writer Dan Shepherd. Siobhan Sharpe and her team at Perfect Curve are asked to refresh the [[Logo of the BBC|BBC logo]] and come to the conclusion that the problem with the current logo is that it has too many letters.\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=4\n |Title=Episode 4\n |DirectedBy=John Morton\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|4|9|df=yes}}\n |Aux4=1.64\n |ShortSummary=A national paper has not only published details of Ian Fletcher's salary but followed up with a story of how he took Sally Owen, his PA at the [[Twenty Twelve|Olympic Deliverance Commission]], on holiday to Italy. So the BBC can either stand by their man or get him to pre-empt potential criticism by persuading him to cut his own salary. Meanwhile, a female ''[[Newsnight]]'' presenter has been accused of wearing clothes that are inappropriately watchable. When the name of the programme becomes known as Kneesnight and her legs get their own Twitter account there is a feeling something should be done about it. Flagship series ''Britain's Tastiest Village'' has lost all three of the big-name presenters who were attached to do the show \u2013 so the search continues. And brand consultant Siobhan Sharpe and her team unveil their barnstorming idea for a new BBC logo.\n |LineColor=bfe0bf\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2===\nOn 15 September 2014, it was announced that ''W1A'' would return for a second series in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/bbc-two-comedy-w1a-return-4263787|title=BBC Two comedy W1A to return for new series|author=Tufayel Ahmed|date=15 September 2014|work=mirror|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29204284|title=Hugh Bonneville returning for W1A comedy|work=BBC News|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/w1a-renewed-for-second-series-on-bbc-9733889.html|title=W1A renewed for second series on BBC|author=Antonia Molloy|date=15 September 2014|work=The Independent|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> This began with a 60-minute special on 23 April, followed by three 30-minute episodes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#FFFFFF;\"\n!style=\"background: #fbec5d;\"| #\n!style=\"background: #fbec5d;\"| Title\n!style=\"background: #fbec5d;\"| Directed by\n!style=\"background: #fbec5d;\"| Written by\n!style=\"background: #fbec5d;\"| Original air date\n!style=\"background: #fbec5d;\"| UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb_30\"/>\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=5\n |Title=Episode 1\n |DirectedBy=[[John Morton (writer)|John Morton]]\n |WrittenBy=John Morton\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2015|4|23|df=yes}}\n |Aux4= 1.95\n |ShortSummary= The team prepare for a visit from [[Prince Charles]] while dealing with issues surrounding [[Jeremy Clarkson]].

oil prices, and large inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2002. GDP growth registered more than 10% per year in 2006 and 2007. From 1997 to date, [[Sudan]] has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms, including a managed float of the exchange rate. Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999.\n\nAgricultural production remains important, because it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years despite rapid rises in average per capital income. In January 2007, the government introduced a new currency, the Sudanese Pound, at an initial exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds.\n\n==History since independence==\nCurrent GDP per capita of Sudan grew 46% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 170% in the 1970s. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 34% in the 1980s.  Finally, it shrank by 26% in the 1990s.<ref>[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html Sudan Stadistics and other info]</ref>\n\nUntil the early 1970s Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972 the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s.  However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan.  At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose.  In 1978 the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government.  This further promoted the mechanized export agriculture sector. This caused great economic problems for the pastoralists of Sudan.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, the IMF, World Bank, and key donors worked closely to promote reforms to counter the effect of inefficient economic policies and practices.  By 1984, a combination of factors, including drought, inflation, and confused application of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], reduced donor disbursements and capital flight led to a serious foreign-exchange crisis and increased shortages of imported inputs and commodities.  More significantly, the 1989 revolution caused many donors in Europe, the U.S., and Canada to suspend official [[development aid|development assistance]], but not [[humanitarian aid]].\n\nHowever, as Sudan became the world's largest debtor to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund by 1993, its relationship with the international financial institutions soured in the mid-1990s and has yet to be fully rehabilitated.  The government fell out of compliance with an IMF standby program and accumulated substantial arrearages on repurchase obligations.  A 4-year economic reform plan was announced in 1988 but was not pursued.\n\nAn economic reform plan was announced in 1989 and began implementing a 3-year economic restructuring program designed to reduce the public sector deficit, end subsidies, privatize state enterprises, and encourage new foreign and domestic investment.  In 1993, the IMF suspended Sudan's voting rights and the World Bank suspended Sudan's right to make withdrawals under effective and fully disbursed loans and credits. Lome Funds and EU agricultural credits, totaling more than one billion euros, also were suspended.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Transportation in Al-Ubayyid.jpg|thumb|left|Highway in [[El-Obeid]]]]\n[[File:Khartoum.jpg|thumb|Khartoum suburbs at night.]]\nSudan has a developed infrastructure comparable to most of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and many projects are taking place to develop it even further all across the country. Some parts of the country are better off\u2014mainly in the northern states\u2014due to oil productions and the wealth gained from it. The telephone system in Sudan is well equipped by regional standards, and is maintained by modern standards. One of Sudan's greatest projects was the [[Merowe Dam]].\n\nKhartoum was rewarded the [[Arab Capital of Culture]] in 2005. Modern buildings in Khartoum are on the rise due to the economic growth. However, since South Sudan independence a number of projects have been postponed due to economic recession after losing 75% of the oil. Transit fees of south Sudan will likely cut the loss greatly and the government economic emergency plan will end in 2015 bringing the economy back on track and after that, the economy will start developing rapidly with construction booms.\n\n===Retailing===\nKhartoum has one of the largest open markets in the region, the [[Souq Al Arabi]]. The market is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold. Al Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous [[high street]]s in [[Khartoum State]].\n\nIn 2010, Sudan's first medium scale [[shopping mall]] opened, located in the southern suburb [[Arkeweet]]. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground. In 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Cornithia hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:PortSudan Post Office.jpg|thumb|The post office in Port Sudan.]]\n[[Sudan]] has 4,725 kilometers of [[narrow-gauge]], single-track [[railroad]]s that serve the northern and central portions of the country. The main line runs from [[Wadi Halfa]] on the [[Egypt]]ian border to [[Khartoum]] and southwest to [[Al-Ubayyid|Al Ubayyid]] via [[Sannar]] and [[Kosti, Sudan|Kusti]], with extensions to [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in [[Southern Darfur]] and [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]] in [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]].\n\nOther lines connect [[Atbarah]] and [[Sannar]] with [[Port Sudan]], and Sannar with [[Ad Damazin]]. A 1,400-kilometer line serves the [[Al Jazirah (state)|al Gezira]] [[cotton]]-growing region. A modest effort to upgrade rail transport is currently underway to reverse decades of neglect and declining efficiency. Service on some lines may be interrupted during the rainy season.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Nubian20pyramids.jpg|thumb|Nubian Pyramids at Meroe.]]\nSudan is one of the largest [[Arab world|Arab]] nations. It is rich in history dating back to the period of [[Nubia|Sudanese Nubia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. There are many pyramids all over Sudan, attracting many tourists from Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and other Arab countries, as well as tourists from Western nations. Sudan was voted the 8th most popular Arab nation to visit by the [[Council of Arab Economic Unity]]. Sudan also has many modern hotels including the five star [[Corinthia Hotel Khartoum]] in Khartoum. The government of Sudan also pledge $1 billion a year to increase the tourist industry.\n\n==Agriculture==\n{{main|Agriculture in Sudan}}\n[[Image:Sudanese man preparing land by traditional way.jpg|thumb|left|Agriculture]]\nPrimary resources are [[agricultural]], including [[cotton]], [[peanut]]s, [[gum arabic]], and [[Sesame|sesame seeds]].  Although the country is trying to diversify its cash crops, cotton and peanuts remain its major agricultural exports.  Grain [[sorghum]] (dura) is the principal food crop, and [[wheat]] is grown for domestic consumption.Sesame seeds and peanuts are cultivated for domestic consumption and increasingly for export.\n\nThree main agricultural sub-sectors are active in Sudan: [[pastoral]] [[livestock]], [[cropping]] and fish production.<ref>[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/771411474649783837/pdf/103352-REVISED-SudanCountryEconomicMemorandumRealizingthePotentialforDiversifiedDevelopmentTheWorldBankWashingtonDC.pdf Sudan Country Economic Memorandum]</ref> [[Livestock]] production has vast potential, and many animals, particularly [[cattle|cows]], [[sheep]], and [[camel]]s, are exported to [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[Arabs|Arab]] countries. However, Sudan remains a net importer of food. Problems of investment finance, production and transportation remain the greatest constraints to a more dynamic agricultural economy. A major problem which has been growing for decades is the continual loss of open lands previously used for animal grazing to [[mechanised agriculture|mechanized]] [[drylands]] and [[irrigated]] [[farming]].<ref>[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/771411474649783837/pdf/103352-REVISED-SudanCountryEconomicMemorandumRealizingthePotentialforDiversifiedDevelopmentTheWorldBankWashingtonDC.pdf Agriculture and livestock: Key for economic diversification]</ref>\n\nSudan has 84 million hectares of arable land and less than 20% is cultivated. Major agricultural projects such as the Gezera Scheme in [[Al Jazirah (state)|Gezira]] state are underway in order to make Sudan food self-sufficient. Sudan is one of the world's potential breadbaskets and Sudan is nicknamed as the Arab world food basket as it accounts for 45% of arable land in the Arab world{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.Agricultural products in total account for about 95 percent of the country's exports. In 1998 there was an estimated 16.9 million hectares (41.8 million acres) of arable land and approximately 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres) set aside for irrigation, primarily in the north of the country along the banks of the [[Nile]] and other rivers.\n\n[[Cash crops]] (as of 1999) grown under irrigation in these areas include [[cotton]] and [[cottonseed]], which is of primary importance to the economy with 172,000 tons and 131,000 tons produced annually respectively,<ref name=\"Nations\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sudan-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Sudan Agriculture|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 30, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081007185823/http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sudan-AGRICULTURE.html| archivedate= 7 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>[[sesame]] (220,000 tons), [[sugarcane]] (5,950,000 tons), [[peanut]]s (980,000 tons), [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] (176,000 tons), [[citrus fruits]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] (136,000 tons), tomatoes (240,000 tons), [[mangoes]], [[coffee]], and [[tobacco]].<ref name=\"Nations\"/> The main subsistence crops produced in Sudan are [[sorghum]] (3,045,000 tons), [[millet]] (1,499,000 tons), [[wheat]] (168,000 tons), [[cowpeas]], [[beans]], [[pulses]], [[maize|corn]] (65,000), and [[barley]].<ref name=\"Nations\"/> Cotton is the principal export crop and an integral part of the country's economy and Sudan is the world's third largest producer of sesame after India and China.<ref name=\"Nations\"/>\n\n==Industry==\nSudan's rapid [[industry|industrial]] development consists of agricultural processing, electronics assembly, plastics manufacturing, furniture, tanning, sugar production, meat processing and various light industries located in any of the 10 Industrial areas in Khartoum. due to the many countries depending on Sudan for medicines and medical services, Sudan is now concentrating on becoming a hub for the medical industry in East Africa, providing facilities and concessions for medical investments and succeeding in covering about 70% of needs and exporting to many neighboring nations. In recent years, the [[Giad|Giad Industrial Complex]] in [[Al Jazirah, Sudan|Al Jazirah]] state introduced the assembly of small autos and trucks, and some heavy military equipment such as armored personnel carriers and the \u201cBashir\u201d and \"Zubair\" main battle [[tank]]s as well as handguns, light and heavy machineguns and howitzers and, recently, drone production. Sudan is reputed to have great [[mineral]] resources, and exploration has started extensively for gold, of which is produced nearly 30 tons annually providing a great boost to the foreign exchange reserves of the nation, with the participation of many investment companies from all over the world. Quantities of asbestos, chromium, mica, kaolin and copper are now exploited commercially, especially for export to China. I love you julia jane.\n\n==Electricity generation==\nSudan is seeking to expand its installed capacity of [[electricity generation]] of around 300 MW;of which 180 MW is [[hydroelectric]] and the rest thermal. [[Europe]]an investors, considering the continuing [[United States|U.S.]] economic, trade, and financial sanctions regime, are the most likely providers of technology for this purpose.\n\nMore than 70% of Sudan's hydropower comes from the [[Roseires Dam]] on the [[Blue Nile]] grid.  Various projects are proposed to expand hydro-power, thermal generation, and other sources of energy, but so far the government has had difficulty arranging sufficient financing.\nA new dam which is being established in [[Merowe, Sudan|Merowe]] which has been opened in 2008 and generates 125 MW of electricity.\n\n==Petroleum==\n[[File:Sudan Export Treemap.png|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Sudan's exports, 2012.]]\n\nExtensive [[petroleum]] exploration first began in Sudan in the mid-1970s. Significant finds were made in the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] region and commercial quantities of oil began to be exported in October 2000, reducing Sudan's outflow of foreign exchange for imported petroleum products. Today, oil is an important export industry in Sudan. Estimates suggest that oil accounts for between 70% and 90% of Sudan's total exports.

oil prices, and large inflows of foreign direct investment until the second half of 2002. GDP growth registered more than 10% per year in 2006 and 2007. From 1997 to date, [[Sudan]] has been working with the IMF to implement macroeconomic reforms, including a managed float of the exchange rate. Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999.\n\nAgricultural production remains important, because it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years despite rapid rises in average per capital income. In January 2007, the government introduced a new currency, the Sudanese Pound, at an initial exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds.\n\n==History since independence==\nCurrent GDP per capita of Sudan grew 46% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 170% in the 1970s. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 34% in the 1980s.  Finally, it shrank by 26% in the 1990s.<ref>[http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html Sudan Stadistics and other info]</ref>\n\nUntil the early 1970s Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972 the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s.  However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan.  At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose.  In 1978 the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government.  This further promoted the mechanized export agriculture sector. This caused great economic problems for the pastoralists of Sudan.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and 1980s, the IMF, World Bank, and key donors worked closely to promote reforms to counter the effect of inefficient economic policies and practices.  By 1984, a combination of factors, including drought, inflation, and confused application of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], reduced donor disbursements and capital flight led to a serious foreign-exchange crisis and increased shortages of imported inputs and commodities.  More significantly, the 1989 revolution caused many donors in Europe, the U.S., and Canada to suspend official [[development aid|development assistance]], but not [[humanitarian aid]].\n\nHowever, as Sudan became the world's largest debtor to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund by 1993, its relationship with the international financial institutions soured in the mid-1990s and has yet to be fully rehabilitated.  The government fell out of compliance with an IMF standby program and accumulated substantial arrearages on repurchase obligations.  A 4-year economic reform plan was announced in 1988 but was not pursued.\n\nAn economic reform plan was announced in 1989 and began implementing a 3-year economic restructuring program designed to reduce the public sector deficit, end subsidies, privatize state enterprises, and encourage new foreign and domestic investment.  In 1993, the IMF suspended Sudan's voting rights and the World Bank suspended Sudan's right to make withdrawals under effective and fully disbursed loans and credits. Lome Funds and EU agricultural credits, totaling more than one billion euros, also were suspended.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Transportation in Al-Ubayyid.jpg|thumb|left|Highway in [[El-Obeid]]]]\n[[File:Khartoum.jpg|thumb|Khartoum suburbs at night.]]\nSudan has a developed infrastructure comparable to most of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and many projects are taking place to develop it even further all across the country. Some parts of the country are better off\u2014mainly in the northern states\u2014due to oil productions and the wealth gained from it. The telephone system in Sudan is well equipped by regional standards, and is maintained by modern standards. One of Sudan's greatest projects was the [[Merowe Dam]].\n\nKhartoum was rewarded the [[Arab Capital of Culture]] in 2005. Modern buildings in Khartoum are on the rise due to the economic growth. However, since South Sudan independence a number of projects have been postponed due to economic recession after losing 75% of the oil. Transit fees of south Sudan will likely cut the loss greatly and the government economic emergency plan will end in 2015 bringing the economy back on track and after that, the economy will start developing rapidly with construction booms.\n\n===Retailing===\nKhartoum has one of the largest open markets in the region, the [[Souq Al Arabi]]. The market is spread over several blocks in the center of Khartoum proper just south of the Great Mosque (Mesjid al-Kabir) and the minibus station. It is divided into separate sections, including one focused entirely on gold. Al Qasr Street and Al Jamhoriyah Street are considered the most famous [[high street]]s in [[Khartoum State]].\n\nIn 2010, Sudan's first medium scale [[shopping mall]] opened, located in the southern suburb [[Arkeweet]]. The Afra Mall has a supermarket, retail outlets, coffee shops, a bowling alley, movie theaters, and a children's playground. In 2011, Sudan opened the Hotel Section and part of the food court of the new, Cornithia hotel Tower. The Mall/Shopping section is still under construction.\n\n===Railways===\n[[File:PortSudan Post Office.jpg|thumb|The post office in Port Sudan.]]\n[[Sudan]] has 4,725 kilometers of [[narrow-gauge]], single-track [[railroad]]s that serve the northern and central portions of the country. The main line runs from [[Wadi Halfa]] on the [[Egypt]]ian border to [[Khartoum]] and southwest to [[Al-Ubayyid|Al Ubayyid]] via [[Sannar]] and [[Kosti, Sudan|Kusti]], with extensions to [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]] in [[Southern Darfur]] and [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]] in [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]].\n\nOther lines connect [[Atbarah]] and [[Sannar]] with [[Port Sudan]], and Sannar with [[Ad Damazin]]. A 1,400-kilometer line serves the [[Al Jazirah (state)|al Gezira]] [[cotton]]-growing region. A modest effort to upgrade rail transport is currently underway to reverse decades of neglect and declining efficiency. Service on some lines may be interrupted during the rainy season.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Nubian20pyramids.jpg|thumb|Nubian Pyramids at Meroe.]]\nSudan is one of the largest [[Arab world|Arab]] nations. It is rich in history dating back to the period of [[Nubia|Sudanese Nubia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]. There are many pyramids all over Sudan, attracting many tourists from Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and other Arab countries, as well as tourists from Western nations. Sudan was voted the 8th most popular Arab nation to visit by the [[Council of Arab Economic Unity]]. Sudan also has many modern hotels including the five star [[Corinthia Hotel Khartoum]] in Khartoum. The government of Sudan also pledge $1 billion a year to increase the tourist industry.\n\n==Agriculture==\n{{main|Agriculture in Sudan}}\n[[Image:Sudanese man preparing land by traditional way.jpg|thumb|left|Agriculture]]\nPrimary resources are [[agricultural]], including [[cotton]], [[peanut]]s, [[gum arabic]], and [[Sesame|sesame seeds]].  Although the country is trying to diversify its cash crops, cotton and peanuts remain its major agricultural exports.  Grain [[sorghum]] (dura) is the principal food crop, and [[wheat]] is grown for domestic consumption.Sesame seeds and peanuts are cultivated for domestic consumption and increasingly for export.\n\nThree main agricultural sub-sectors are active in Sudan: [[pastoral]] [[livestock]], [[cropping]] and fish production.<ref>[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/771411474649783837/pdf/103352-REVISED-SudanCountryEconomicMemorandumRealizingthePotentialforDiversifiedDevelopmentTheWorldBankWashingtonDC.pdf Sudan Country Economic Memorandum]</ref> [[Livestock]] production has vast potential, and many animals, particularly [[cattle|cows]], [[sheep]], and [[camel]]s, are exported to [[Saudi Arabia]] and other [[Arabs|Arab]] countries. However, Sudan remains a net importer of food. Problems of investment finance, production and transportation remain the greatest constraints to a more dynamic agricultural economy. A major problem which has been growing for decades is the continual loss of open lands previously used for animal grazing to [[mechanised agriculture|mechanized]] [[drylands]] and [[irrigated]] [[farming]].<ref>[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/771411474649783837/pdf/103352-REVISED-SudanCountryEconomicMemorandumRealizingthePotentialforDiversifiedDevelopmentTheWorldBankWashingtonDC.pdf Agriculture and livestock: Key for economic diversification]</ref>\n\nSudan has 84 million hectares of arable land and less than 20% is cultivated. Major agricultural projects such as the Gezera Scheme in [[Al Jazirah (state)|Gezira]] state are underway in order to make Sudan food self-sufficient. Sudan is one of the world's potential breadbaskets and Sudan is nicknamed as the Arab world food basket as it accounts for 45% of arable land in the Arab world{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.Agricultural products in total account for about 95 percent of the country's exports. In 1998 there was an estimated 16.9 million hectares (41.8 million acres) of arable land and approximately 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres) set aside for irrigation, primarily in the north of the country along the banks of the [[Nile]] and other rivers.\n\n[[Cash crops]] (as of 1999) grown under irrigation in these areas include [[cotton]] and [[cottonseed]], which is of primary importance to the economy with 172,000 tons and 131,000 tons produced annually respectively,<ref name=\"Nations\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sudan-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Sudan Agriculture|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 30, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081007185823/http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sudan-AGRICULTURE.html| archivedate= 7 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>[[sesame]] (220,000 tons), [[sugarcane]] (5,950,000 tons), [[peanut]]s (980,000 tons), [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] (176,000 tons), [[citrus fruits]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]] (136,000 tons), tomatoes (240,000 tons), [[mangoes]], [[coffee]], and [[tobacco]].<ref name=\"Nations\"/> The main subsistence crops produced in Sudan are [[sorghum]] (3,045,000 tons), [[millet]] (1,499,000 tons), [[wheat]] (168,000 tons), [[cowpeas]], [[beans]], [[pulses]], [[maize|corn]] (65,000), and [[barley]].<ref name=\"Nations\"/> Cotton is the principal export crop and an integral part of the country's economy and Sudan is the world's third largest producer of sesame after India and China.<ref name=\"Nations\"/>\n\n==Industry==\nSudan's rapid [[industry|industrial]] development consists of agricultural processing, electronics assembly, plastics manufacturing, furniture, tanning, sugar production, meat processing and various light industries located in any of the 10 Industrial areas in Khartoum. due to the many countries depending on Sudan for medicines and medical services, Sudan is now concentrating on becoming a hub for the medical industry in East Africa, providing facilities and concessions for medical investments and succeeding in covering about 70% of needs and exporting to many neighboring nations. In recent years, the [[Giad|Giad Industrial Complex]] in [[Al Jazirah, Sudan|Al Jazirah]] state introduced the assembly of small autos and trucks, and some heavy military equipment such as armored personnel carriers and the \u201cBashir\u201d and \"Zubair\" main battle [[tank]]s as well as handguns, light and heavy machineguns and howitzers and, recently, drone production. Sudan is reputed to have great [[mineral]] resources, and exploration has started extensively for gold, of which is produced nearly 30 tons annually providing a great boost to the foreign exchange reserves of the nation, with the participation of many investment companies from all over the world. Quantities of asbestos, chromium, mica, kaolin and copper are now exploited commercially, especially for export to China.\n\n==Electricity generation==\nSudan is seeking to expand its installed capacity of [[electricity generation]] of around 300 MW;of which 180 MW is [[hydroelectric]] and the rest thermal. [[Europe]]an investors, considering the continuing [[United States|U.S.]] economic, trade, and financial sanctions regime, are the most likely providers of technology for this purpose.\n\nMore than 70% of Sudan's hydropower comes from the [[Roseires Dam]] on the [[Blue Nile]] grid.  Various projects are proposed to expand hydro-power, thermal generation, and other sources of energy, but so far the government has had difficulty arranging sufficient financing.\nA new dam which is being established in [[Merowe, Sudan|Merowe]] which has been opened in 2008 and generates 125 MW of electricity.\n\n==Petroleum==\n[[File:Sudan Export Treemap.png|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Sudan's exports, 2012.]]\n\nExtensive [[petroleum]] exploration first began in Sudan in the mid-1970s. Significant finds were made in the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] region and commercial quantities of oil began to be exported in October 2000, reducing Sudan's outflow of foreign exchange for imported petroleum products. Today, oil is an important export industry in Sudan. Estimates suggest that oil accounts for between 70% and 90% of Sudan's total exports. The primary importers of Sudanese oil are Japan, China, South Korea, Indonesia, and India.<ref>Energy Information Administration 2007, [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Sudan/Full.html 'Country analysis brief: Sudan'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313172226/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Sudan/Full.html |date=13 March 2008 }}, ''www.eia.doe.gov'', April.

A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first media appearance with bandmate [[Han Geng]] as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.\n\nChoi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group ''Super Junior 05'' on 6 November 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' music program ''[[Inkigayo|Popular Songs]]'', performing their first single, \"[[Knockout (Triple 8 song)#Super Junior version|Twins (Knock Out)]]\". Their debut album ''[[Twins (Super Junior album)|Twins]]'' was released a month later on 5 December 2005 and debuted at number three  on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.\n\nIn March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. Following the addition of thirteenth member [[Cho Kyu-hyun|Kyuhyun]], the group dropped the suffix \"05\" and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \"[[U (Super Junior song)#Super Junior-M's cover|U]]\" on 8 April 2008. This was followed by the release of the debut Chinese-language [[studio album]], ''[[Me (Super Junior-M album)|Me]]'' in selected provinces in China on 23 April and 2 May in Taiwan.\n\n===Acting career===\nIn 2006, Choi was cast in the Hong Kong [[epic film]] ''[[A Battle of Wits (2006 film)|A Battle of Wits]]'', playing the role of the Liang Prince.

A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first media appearance with bandmate [[Han Geng]] as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.\n\nChoi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group ''Super Junior 05'' on 6 November 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' music program ''[[Inkigayo|Popular Songs]]'', performing their first single, \"[[Knockout (Triple 8 song)#Super Junior version|Twins (Knock Out)]]\". Their debut album ''[[Twins (Super Junior album)|Twins]]'' was released a month later on 5 December 2005 and debuted at number three  on the monthly MIAK K-pop album charts.\n\nIn March 2006, SM Entertainment began to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation. However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. Following the addition of thirteenth member [[Cho Kyu-hyun|Kyuhyun]], the group dropped the suffix \"05\" and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \"[[U (Super Junior song)#Super Junior-M's cover|U]]\" on 8 April 2008. This was followed by the release of the debut Chinese-language [[studio album]], ''[[Me (Super Junior-M album)|Me]]'' in selected provinces in China on 23 April and 2 May in Taiwan.\n\n===Acting career===\nIn 2006, Choi was cast in the Hong Kong [[epic film]] ''[[A Battle of Wits (2006 film)|A Battle of Wits]]'', playing the role of the Liang Prince.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity'').

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin (see section ''Why hemoglobin F has high oxygen affinity'').

As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and this favors the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

Furthermore, his seven goals in the last eight games of the 1978/79 season were crucial for Manchester City in their relegation battle.\n\n===San Diego Sockers===\nHe appeared in the 1981 film ''[[Escape to Victory]]'' as Paul Wolcheck.<ref name=\"imdb0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223391|title=Kazimierz Deyna|date=|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref> In the same year, he emigrated to the United States, where he signed with the [[San Diego Sockers (1978\u20131996)|San Diego Sockers]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968-1984)|North American Soccer League]] in January 1981. During the next seven years, he played four NASL outdoor seasons, one NASL indoor season and five [[Major Indoor Soccer League (2008\u2013)|Major Indoor Soccer League]] seasons with the Sockers, winning five championships.

{"title_page": "Release agent", "text_new": "{{for|the pharmacological meaning|releasing agent}}\n[[File:File-Water droplet at DWR-coated surface1.jpg|thumb|300px|Release agents often produce low [[surface energy]] and a high [[contact angle]].]]\nA '''release agent''' (also mold release agent, release coating, or mold release coating) is a [[chemical]] used to prevent other materials from bonding to surfaces. It can provide a solution in processes involving [[Mould (casting)|mold]] release, [[Die casting|die-cast]] release, [[plastic]] release, [[adhesive]] release, and [[tire]] and [[Web (manufacturing)|web]] release. \n\nRelease agents provide the critical barrier between a molding surface and the substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place, the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a release agent is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper release agent choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.\n\n== Types of release agents ==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Semi-permanent ===\nOne of the key attributes of a release agent is its degree of permanence: how long will it last before reapplication is necessary. A semi-permanent release agent does not need to be reapplied for every cycle of a molding operation and even works better when it is not over-applied to the mold surface. \n\nHow many releases can be achieved before reapplication is necessary varies by process, material, and application method. In order to achieve multiple releases per application, the semi-permanent release coating generally must  be applied to a clean, dry surface free of dirt, rust, grime or previous coatings. This allows the release agent to properly bond to the mold and mold tooling, improving durability and longevity of the coating.\n\n=== Sacrificial ===\nSacrificial coatings must be applied before every cycle of a molding operation and are therefore considered more labor intensive. Most molders will prefer semi-permanent coatings to sacrificial coatings, especially when molding rubber and plastic parts. These coatings contain fewer solid ingredients, and thus do not last as long as semi-permanent coatings.\n\n=== Water- or solvent-based ===\nRelease agents may be water or solvent-based and use of either will depend on the personal preference of the molder, plant safety regulations, hazardous materials shipping costs, state, local, or federal regulations, and/or desired drying times of the release coating. \n\n==== Water-based ====\nWater-Based Die lubricant has been used for about 40 years.  All die casting machines have been designed with the use of WBD<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultraseal-impregnation.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/08/GIFA-2011-Final-Lubrolene-Technical-Paper.pdf|title=Water-Free Electrostatic Spray for High Pressure Die Casting|last=Butler|first=Tim|date=2011|website=Ultreaseal International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Water-based release coatings generally dry slower than solvent-based release agents but present fewer health and safety concerns. Water-based release agents will be less expensive to ship because of their inherently non-flammable nature and satisfy most plant-safety goals.\n\n===== Solvent-based =====\nSolvent-based release coatings dry almost instantly but present serious health and safety concerns. Fumes from solvent-based release agents may be hazardous without proper ventilation of the work area. Most solvents used in release agents are flammable.  \n\n===== Non-flammable solvents =====\nNon-flammable release agents are available and usually classified as [[Combustibility and flammability|combustible]].\n\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Asphalt===\nAsphalt Release Agents are chemical products developed and manufactured as alternatives to diesel and solvents commonly used for cleaning equipment associated with  Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete (HMAC) production and placement on government and private facilities. The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1980 was used as the foundation to build the current program. The intent of asphalt release agents is to eliminate harmful stripping products that come into contact with bituminous products and strip the asphalt (binding agent) from the aggregates causing potholes, raveling, and other detrimental pavement failures.\n===Concrete===\nIn the [[concrete]] construction industry, form release agents prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually [[plywood]], overlaid plywood, [[steel]] or [[aluminum]].  In this application, there are two types of release agents available:  barrier and reactive.\n\n'''Barrier release agents''' prevent [[adhesion]] by the development of a physical [[film]] or barrier between the forming surface and the concrete.\n\n'''Reactive release agents''' are chemically active and work by the process of a [[chemical reaction]] between the release agent and the free [[lime (material)|lime]]s available in fresh concrete.  A soapy film is created which prevents adhesion.  Because it is a chemically reactive process, there is generally little to no residue or non-reacted product left on the forming surface or concrete which provides for a cleaner process.\n\n=== Food processing ===\nRelease agents are used to aid in the separation of [[food]] from a cooking container after [[baking]] or [[roasting]]. Traditionally [[fat]] or [[flour]] have been used, but in industrial food processing other chemicals might be used. The application is called bakery release.\n\nIn [[bakery paper]] or [[greaseproof paper]] release agents like [[catalyst]]-cured [[silicone]] release coatings may be used.\n\n=== Metal casting ===\nMold release agent also can be used in die casting or metal forging process of metal, such as Aluminum, Aluminum Alloy, Zinc, Zinc Alloy, Magnesium, etc.\n\n=== Paper ===\nIn industrial [[papermaking]] release agents are used to get slip effect of the paper from the processing equipment. A release agent may be applied on the process rolls (like the [[yankee dryer]]) or in the [[paper coating]].\n\nSome [[paper]] types are made with low [[Surface energy]]  release coatings:\n*[[Release liner]]s for pressure-sensitive adhesive laminates and tapes\n*Casting papers\n*General industrial release papers\n*Food-grade release and packaging papers\n\n=== Pharmaceuticals ===\nRelease agents (e.g., [[magnesium stearate]]) are added to powdered and granulated drug compositions, to serve as a lubricant for mold release purposes during tabletting.\n\n=== Plastics ===\nRelease agents are coated onto some [[plastic film]]s to prevent adhesives from bonding to the plastic surface.  Some release agents, also known as de-molding agent, form oil, parting agent or form releaser, are substances used in [[Molding (process)|molding]] and [[casting]] that aid in the separation of a mould from the material being moulded and reduce imperfections in the moulded surface.\n\n=== Rubber ===\nThere are two types of release agents used in the molding of rubber products. Both are [[silicone]] based. The decision on which to use has to do with lubricity and release.  Water-diluted silicon is used when you have rubber sliding over a hot mold (sheets or slugs). The silicon keeps the rubber from sticking to the mold but just as important it lubricates the rubber so it will slide over the hot mold as it is loaded. Diluted silicon typically has to be applied every cycle.  Semi-permanent mold release builds a silicon matrix on the mold that becomes a barrier between the rubber and the metal surface of the mold. The matrix is created by the other ingredients in the semi-permanent mold release. Applications of semi-permanent mold release vary from every cycle to once daily applications depending on the compound being molded and the design and quality of the mold. Silicone-based rubber products, however, require a non-silicone based releasing agent.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Plastics industry]]\n[[Category:Process chemicals]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the pharmacological meaning|releasing agent}}\n[[File:File-Water droplet at DWR-coated surface1.jpg|thumb|300px|Release agents often produce low [[surface energy]] and a high [[contact angle]].]]\nA '''release agent''' (also mold release agent, release coating, or mold release coating) is a [[chemical]] used to prevent other materials from bonding to surfaces. It can provide a solution in processes involving [[Mould (casting)|mold]] release, [[Die casting|die-cast]] release, [[plastic]] release, [[adhesive]] release, and [[tire]] and [[Web (manufacturing)|web]] release. \n\nRelease agents provide the critical barrier between a molding surface and the substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place, the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a release agent is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper release agent choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.\n\n== Types of release agents ==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Semi-permanent ===\nOne of the key attributes of a release agent is its degree of permanence: how long will it last before reapplication is necessary. A semi-permanent release agent does not need to be reapplied for every cycle of a molding operation and even works better when it is not over-applied to the mold surface. \n\nHow many releases can be achieved before reapplication is necessary varies by process, material, and application method. In order to achieve multiple releases per application, the semi-permanent release coating generally must  be applied to a clean, dry surface free of dirt, rust, grime or previous coatings. This allows the release agent to properly bond to the mold and mold tooling, improving durability and longevity of the coating.\n\n=== Sacrificial ===\nSacrificial coatings must be applied before every cycle of a molding operation and are therefore considered more labor intensive. Most molders will prefer semi-permanent coatings to sacrificial coatings, especially when molding rubber and plastic parts. These coatings contain fewer solid ingredients, and thus do not last as long as semi-permanent coatings.\n\n=== Water- or solvent-based ===\nRelease agents may be water or solvent-based and use of either will depend on the personal preference of the molder, plant safety regulations, hazardous materials shipping costs, state, local, or federal regulations, and/or desired drying times of the release coating. \n\n==== Water-based ====\nWater-based release coatings generally dry slower than solvent-based release agents but present fewer health and safety concerns. Water-based release agents will be less expensive to ship because of their inherently non-flammable nature and satisfy most plant-safety goals.\n\n===== Solvent-based =====\nSolvent-based release coatings dry almost instantly but present serious health and safety concerns. Fumes from solvent-based release agents may be hazardous without proper ventilation of the work area. Most solvents used in release agents are flammable.  \n\n===== Non-flammable solvents =====\nNon-flammable release agents are available and usually classified as [[Combustibility and flammability|combustible]].\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Asphalt===\nAsphalt Release Agents are chemical products developed and manufactured as alternatives to diesel and solvents commonly used for cleaning equipment associated with  Hot Mix Asphaltic Concrete (HMAC) production and placement on government and private facilities. The United States Oil Pollution Act of 1980 was used as the foundation to build the current program. The intent of asphalt release agents is to eliminate harmful stripping products that come into contact with bituminous products and strip the asphalt (binding agent) from the aggregates causing potholes, raveling, and other detrimental pavement failures.\n===Concrete===\nIn the [[concrete]] construction industry, form release agents prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually [[plywood]], overlaid plywood, [[steel]] or [[aluminum]].  In this application, there are two types of release agents available:  barrier and reactive.\n\n'''Barrier release agents''' prevent [[adhesion]] by the development of a physical [[film]] or barrier between the forming surface and the concrete.\n\n'''Reactive release agents''' are chemically active and work by the process of a [[chemical reaction]] between the release agent and the free [[lime (material)|lime]]s available in fresh concrete.  A soapy film is created which prevents adhesion.  Because it is a chemically reactive process, there is generally little to no residue or non-reacted product left on the forming surface or concrete which provides for a cleaner process.\n\n=== Food processing ===\nRelease agents are used to aid in the separation of [[food]] from a cooking container after [[baking]] or [[roasting]]. Traditionally [[fat]] or [[flour]] have been used, but in industrial food processing other chemicals might be used. The application is called bakery release.\n\nIn [[bakery paper]] or [[greaseproof paper]] release agents like [[catalyst]]-cured [[silicone]] release coatings may be used.\n\n=== Metal casting ===\nMold release agent also can be used in die casting or metal forging process of metal, such as Aluminum, Aluminum Alloy, Zinc, Zinc Alloy, Magnesium, etc.\n\n=== Paper ===\nIn industrial [[papermaking]] release agents are used to get slip effect of the paper from the processing equipment. A release agent may be applied on the process rolls (like the [[yankee dryer]]) or in the [[paper coating]].\n\nSome [[paper]] types are made with low [[Surface energy]]  release coatings:\n*[[Release liner]]s for pressure-sensitive adhesive laminates and tapes\n*Casting papers\n*General industrial release papers\n*Food-grade release and packaging papers\n\n=== Pharmaceuticals ===\nRelease agents (e.g., [[magnesium stearate]]) are added to powdered and granulated drug compositions, to serve as a lubricant for mold release purposes during tabletting.\n\n=== Plastics ===\nRelease agents are coated onto some [[plastic film]]s to prevent adhesives from bonding to the plastic surface.  Some release agents, also known as de-molding agent, form oil, parting agent or form releaser, are substances used in [[Molding (process)|molding]] and [[casting]] that aid in the separation of a mould from the material being moulded and reduce imperfections in the moulded surface.\n\n=== Rubber ===\nThere are two types of release agents used in the molding of rubber products. Both are [[silicone]] based. The decision on which to use has to do with lubricity and release.  Water-diluted silicon is used when you have rubber sliding over a hot mold (sheets or slugs). The silicon keeps the rubber from sticking to the mold but just as important it lubricates the rubber so it will slide over the hot mold as it is loaded. Diluted silicon typically has to be applied every cycle.  Semi-permanent mold release builds a silicon matrix on the mold that becomes a barrier between the rubber and the metal surface of the mold. The matrix is created by the other ingredients in the semi-permanent mold release. Applications of semi-permanent mold release vary from every cycle to once daily applications depending on the compound being molded and the design and quality of the mold. Silicone-based rubber products, however, require a non-silicone based releasing agent.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Plastics industry]]\n[[Category:Process chemicals]]\n", "name_user": "Coraleva", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWater-based:\u2192\u200eWater-based:- I've added a source from Tim Butler - he worked with Lubrolene AOKI Science LTD - they've done a lot of research into water based die release agents, and electrostatic release agents.

In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the \"Arte y reglas de la Lengua Tagala\" (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his \"Vocabulario de la lengua tagala\" in Pila, Laguna.\n\nThe first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and Jos\u00e9 Hernandez.<ref>Juan Jos\u00e9 de Noceda, Pedro de Sanlucar, Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala, Manila 2013, pg iv, Komision sa Wikang Filipino</ref> Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P.

Being [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], it is related to other Austronesian languages, such as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] ([[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[Tetum language|Tetum]] (of Timor), and [[Yami language|Yami]] (of Taiwan).<ref name=\"ethnologue.com\">Lewis, M.P., Simons, G.F., & Fennig, C.D. (2014). Tagalog. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the\nWorld.'' Retrieved from http://www.ethnologue.com/language/tgl</ref> It is closely related to the languages spoken in the [[Bicol Region]] and the [[Visayas]] islands, such as the [[Bikol languages|Bikol group]] and the [[Visayan languages|Visayan group]], including [[Waray language|Waray-Waray]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].<ref name=\"ethnologue.com\"/>\n\n===Dialects===\n[[File:Katagalugan.png|thumb|Distribution of Tagalog dialects in the Philippines. The color-schemes represent the four dialect zones of the language: Northern, Central, Southern and [[Marinduque]]. While the majority of residents in [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] traditionally speak [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] as their first language, these provinces nonetheless have significant Tagalog minorities. In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]\n\nAt present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngay\u00f3n'' (now, today), ''sinig\u00e1ng'' (broth stew), ''gab\u00ed'' (night), ''matam\u00eds'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.\n* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bund\u00f3k'', ''dagat'', ''dingd\u00edng'', and ''isd\u00e2'' become ''bunr\u00f3k'', ''ragat'', ''ringr\u00edng'', and ''isr\u00e2'', e.g. \"sand\u00f3k sa dingd\u00edng\" becoming \"sanr\u00f3k sa ringr\u00edng\".\n* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in ka ba ng pat\u00edng?'' (\"Do you eat shark?\"), he would be understood as saying \"Has a shark eaten you?\" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.\n* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=2015 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Filipino language|Manila Tagalog]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Marinduque\u00f1o Tagalog\n! scope=\"col\" | English\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Susulat sin\u00e1 Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| M\u00e1s\u00falat da Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| \"Mar\u00eda and Esperanza will write to Juan.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mag-aaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| Gaaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| \"[He/She] will study in Manila.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maglut\u00f2 ka na.\n| Paglut\u00f2.\n| \"Cook now.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kainin mo iy\u00e1n.\n| Kaina yaan.\n| \"Eat it.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tinatawag tayo ni Tatay.\n| Inatawag ngan\u00ec kit\u00e1 ni Tatay.\n| \"Father is calling us.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\u00fatulungan ba kay\u00f3 ni Hilario?\n| Atulungan ga kamo ni Hilario?\n| \"Is Hilario going to help you?\"\n|}\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\n===Accents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\n[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangue\u00f1os as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more [[Linguistic conservatism|deep words]] and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents. Quezon's Tagalog has also has several unique words, and each town has a different tone, like in [[Sariaya]], [[Atimonan]] and [[Gumaca]].\n\nCavite accent specifically in the lowland part of the province were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga while in upland Cavite like in the municipalities of [[Alfonso, Cavite]], [[Magallanes, Cavite]] as well as [[Tagaytay City]] uses the accent comparable to the accent used in western Batangas due to its proximity.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents, notably in the municipality of [[Alaminos, Laguna]] and the City of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] has the accent comparable to the accent used in eastern Batangas while the accent used in the northern parts of Laguna such as [[Bi\u00f1an, Laguna]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna]] uses the accent comparable to Manila Tagalog.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n===Code-switching with English===\n{{main|Taglish}}\n\n''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\n{{Verse translation\n| Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?\n| We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?\n}}\n\nCity-dwellers are more likely to do this.\n\nThe practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nTagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally CrVC, where Cr only occurs in borrowed words such as ''trak'' \"truck\" or ''sombr\u00e9ro'' \"hat\".<ref name=ELL>{{ELL2|Tagalog}}</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nTagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs.<ref name=ELL/> Before appearing in the area north of the Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from central and northern Philippines, such as the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages, as well as Spanish words.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+caption | '''Table of the five general Tagalog vowel phonemes'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]\u2014or [[alphasyllabary]]\u2014called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 rather than \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La Espa\u00f1a Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La Espa\u00f1a'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name=\"k is for\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938\u2013967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The revolutionary society Kata\u00e1s-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng\u0303 mg\u0303\u00e1 Anak ng\u0303 Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name=\"k is for\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balar\u00edl\u00e0 ng Wikang Pambans\u00e2'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name=\"ebolusyon\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref> The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\n===Baybayin===\n{{Main|Baybayin}}\n\nTagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]</div>\n\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin A.svg|center|\u1700]] a || [[File:Baybayin E-I.svg|center|\u1701]] e/i || [[File:Baybayin O-U.svg|center|\u1702]] o/u\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ka.svg|center|\u1703]] ka || [[File:Baybayin Ga.svg|center|\u1704]] ga || [[File:Baybayin Nga.svg|center|\u1705]] nga\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ta.svg|center|\u1706]] ta || [[File:Baybayin Da.svg|center|\u1707]] da/ra || [[File:Baybayin Na.svg|center|\u1708]] na\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Pa.svg|center|\u1709]] pa || [[File:Baybayin Ba.svg|center|\u170a]] ba || [[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|center|\u170b]] ma\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ya.svg|center|\u170c]] ya || [[File:Baybayin La.svg|center|\u170e]] la || [[File:Baybayin Wa.svg|center|\u170f]] wa || [[File:Baybayin Sa.svg|center|\u1710]] sa || [[File:Baybayin Ha.svg|center|\u1711]] ha\n|}\n</div>\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ vowels\n!

(Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[na\u014b]}} and ''mang\u00e1'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. \n* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadul\u00e1s.''\u2014When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.\n* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''\u2014He woke up <u>early</u>.\n* ''Gumal\u00edng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''\u2014Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.\n\nIn the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is \"greatly\" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').\n\nThe longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:\n*''Naghint\u00e1y sila '''nang''' naghint\u00e1y.''\u2014They kept on waiting\" (a closer calque: \"They were waiting and waiting.\")\n\n===''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2''===\nThe words ''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"''oo''\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"P\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"H\u00f4\" and \"oh\u00f2\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"p\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n*Example: \"''Pakitapon naman '''p\u00f4/ho''' yung basura.''\" (\"Please throw away the trash.\")\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n*Ex: \"''Gut\u00f3m ka na ba?\" \"'''Op\u00f2/Oh\u00f2'''''\". (\"Are you hungry yet?\" \"Yes.\")\n\n''P\u00f4/H\u00f4'' may also be used in negation.\n*Ex: \"''Hindi ko '''p\u00f4/h\u00f4''' alam 'yan.''\" (\"I don't know that.\")\n\n==Vocabulary and borrowed words==\n{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, the [[Silk Road]], the [[Tang Dynasty]], the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], the [[Spice Route]] and the [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Other examples of Tagalog words used in English\n! scope=\"col \" | Example\n! scope=\"col \" | Definition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[boondocks]]\n| meaning \"rural\" or \"back country,\" was imported by American soldiers stationed in the Philippines following the Spanish\u2013American War as a mispronounced version of the Tagalog ''bundok'', which means \"mountain.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | cogon\n| a type of grass, used for thatching.

The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> (\"the Bible\") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version\n* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]\n* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version\n* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Lord's Prayer===\nIn Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Am\u00e1 Namin'' (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\n{{Poemquote\n| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;\n| text=\nAm\u00e1 namin, sumasalangit Ka,\nSambah\u00edn ang ngalan Mo.\nMapasaamin ang kahari\u00e1n Mo.\nSund\u00edn ang lo\u00f3b Mo,\nDito sa lup\u00e0, gaya nang sa langit.\nBigy\u00e1n Mo kam\u00ed ngay\u00f3n ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,\nAt patawarin Mo kam\u00ed sa aming mga sal\u00e2,\nPara nang pagp\u00e1patawad namin,\nSa nagkakasal\u00e0 sa amin;\nAt huw\u00e1g Mo kam\u00edng ipahintulot sa tuks\u00f3,\nAt iady\u00e2 Mo kam\u00ed sa lah\u00e1t ng masam\u00e2.\n[Sapagk\u00e1t sa Iny\u00f3 ang kahari\u00e1n, at ang kapangyarihan,\nAt ang kaluw\u00e1lhatian, ngay\u00f3n, at magpakailanman.]\nAmen.\n}}\n\n===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\nThis is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''P\u00e1ngkalahat\u00e1ng Pagpapahayag ng Karapat\u00e1ng Pantao'')\n\n{{Verse translation\n| lang=tl\n| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may lay\u00e0 at magkakapant\u00e1y ang tagl\u00e1y na dang\u00e1l at karapat\u00e1n.

The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.)

The changing of the name did not, however, result in acceptance among non-[[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]], especially [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]]s who had not accepted the selection.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/>\n\nThe national language issue was revived once more during the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|1971 Constitutional Convention]].

The 1973 constitution makes no mention of Tagalog. When a new constitution was drawn up in 1987, it named Filipino as the national language.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/> The constitution specified that as the Filipino language evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. However, more than two decades after the institution of the \"universalist\" approach, there seems to be little if any difference between Tagalog and Filipino.\n\nMany of the older generation in the Philippines feel that the replacement of English by Tagalog in the popular visual media has had dire economic effects regarding the competitiveness of the Philippines in trade and overseas remittances.<ref>{{cite news |title=The cost of being tongue-tied in the colonisers' tongue |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2009/06/04/e-for-english |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=4 June 2009 |quote=ONCE it claimed to have more English speakers than all but two other countries, and it has exported millions of them. But these days Filipinos are less boastful. Three decades of decline in the share of Filipinos who speak the language, and the deteriorating proficiency of those who can manage some English, have eroded one of the country's advantages in the global economy. Call-centres complain that they reject nine-tenths of otherwise qualified job applicants, mostly college graduates, because of their poor command of English.

(2014). Tagalog. ''Ethnologue: Languages of the\nWorld.'' Retrieved from http://www.ethnologue.com/language/tgl</ref> It is closely related to the languages spoken in the [[Bicol Region]] and the [[Visayas]] islands, such as the [[Bikol languages|Bikol group]] and the [[Visayan languages|Visayan group]], including [[Waray language|Waray-Waray]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]].<ref name=\"ethnologue.com\"/>\n\n===Dialects===\n[[File:Katagalugan.png|thumb|Distribution of Tagalog dialects in the Philippines. The color-schemes represent the four dialect zones of the language: Northern, Central, Southern and [[Marinduque]]. While the majority of residents in [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] traditionally speak [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] as their first language, these provinces nonetheless have significant Tagalog minorities. In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]\n\nAt present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngay\u00f3n'' (now, today), ''sinig\u00e1ng'' (broth stew), ''gab\u00ed'' (night), ''matam\u00eds'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.\n* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bund\u00f3k'', ''dagat'', ''dingd\u00edng'', and ''isd\u00e2'' become ''bunr\u00f3k'', ''ragat'', ''ringr\u00edng'', and ''isr\u00e2'', e.g. \"sand\u00f3k sa dingd\u00edng\" becoming \"sanr\u00f3k sa ringr\u00edng\".\n* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in ka ba ng pat\u00edng?'' (\"Do you eat shark?\"), he would be understood as saying \"Has a shark eaten you?\" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.\n* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=2015 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Filipino language|Manila Tagalog]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Marinduque\u00f1o Tagalog\n! scope=\"col\" | English\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Susulat sin\u00e1 Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| M\u00e1s\u00falat da Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| \"Mar\u00eda and Esperanza will write to Juan.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mag-aaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| Gaaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| \"[He/She] will study in Manila.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maglut\u00f2 ka na.\n| Paglut\u00f2.\n| \"Cook now.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kainin mo iy\u00e1n.\n| Kaina yaan.\n| \"Eat it.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tinatawag tayo ni Tatay.\n| Inatawag ngan\u00ec kit\u00e1 ni Tatay.\n| \"Father is calling us.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\u00fatulungan ba kay\u00f3 ni Hilario?\n| Atulungan ga kamo ni Hilario?\n| \"Is Hilario going to help you?\"\n|}\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\n===Accents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\n[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangue\u00f1os as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more [[Linguistic conservatism|deep words]] and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents. Quezon's Tagalog has also has several unique words, and each town has a different tone, like in [[Sariaya]], [[Atimonan]] and [[Gumaca]].\n\nCavite accent specifically in the lowland part of the province were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga while in upland Cavite like in the municipalities of [[Alfonso, Cavite]], [[Magallanes, Cavite]] as well as [[Tagaytay City]] uses the accent comparable to the accent used in western Batangas due to its proximity.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents, notably in the municipality of [[Alaminos, Laguna]] and the City of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] has the accent comparable to the accent used in eastern Batangas while the accent used in the northern parts of Laguna such as [[Bi\u00f1an, Laguna]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna]] uses the accent comparable to Manila Tagalog.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n===Code-switching with English===\n{{main|Taglish}}\n\n''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\n{{Verse translation\n| Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?\n| We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?\n}}\n\nCity-dwellers are more likely to do this.\n\nThe practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nTagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally CrVC, where Cr only occurs in borrowed words such as ''trak'' \"truck\" or ''sombr\u00e9ro'' \"hat\".<ref name=ELL>{{ELL2|Tagalog}}</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nTagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs.<ref name=ELL/> Before appearing in the area north of the Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from central and northern Philippines, such as the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages, as well as Spanish words.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+caption | '''Table of the five general Tagalog vowel phonemes'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

Primary stress occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Vowel lengthening accompanies primary or secondary stress except when stress occurs at the end of a word.\n\nTagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress and/or the presence of a final glottal stop. In formal or academic settings, stress placement and the glottal stop are indicated by a [[diacritic]] (''tuld\u00edk'') above the final vowel.<ref>Himmelmann, Nikolaus (2005). \"Tagalog\" in K. Alexander Adelaar & Nikolaus Himmelmann (eds.)

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]\u2014or [[alphasyllabary]]\u2014called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 rather than \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La Espa\u00f1a Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La Espa\u00f1a'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name=\"k is for\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938\u2013967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The revolutionary society Kata\u00e1s-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng\u0303 mg\u0303\u00e1 Anak ng\u0303 Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name=\"k is for\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balar\u00edl\u00e0 ng Wikang Pambans\u00e2'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name=\"ebolusyon\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref> The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\n===Baybayin===\n{{Main|Baybayin}}\n\nTagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]</div>\n\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin A.svg|center|\u1700]] a || [[File:Baybayin E-I.svg|center|\u1701]] e/i || [[File:Baybayin O-U.svg|center|\u1702]] o/u\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ka.svg|center|\u1703]] ka || [[File:Baybayin Ga.svg|center|\u1704]] ga || [[File:Baybayin Nga.svg|center|\u1705]] nga\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ta.svg|center|\u1706]] ta || [[File:Baybayin Da.svg|center|\u1707]] da/ra || [[File:Baybayin Na.svg|center|\u1708]] na\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Pa.svg|center|\u1709]] pa || [[File:Baybayin Ba.svg|center|\u170a]] ba || [[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|center|\u170b]] ma\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ya.svg|center|\u170c]] ya || [[File:Baybayin La.svg|center|\u170e]] la || [[File:Baybayin Wa.svg|center|\u170f]] wa || [[File:Baybayin Sa.svg|center|\u1710]] sa || [[File:Baybayin Ha.svg|center|\u1711]] ha\n|}\n</div>\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ vowels\n!

(Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[na\u014b]}} and ''mang\u00e1'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. \n* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadul\u00e1s.''\u2014When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.\n* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''\u2014He woke up <u>early</u>.\n* ''Gumal\u00edng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''\u2014Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.\n\nIn the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is \"greatly\" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').\n\nThe longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:\n*''Naghint\u00e1y sila '''nang''' naghint\u00e1y.''\u2014They kept on waiting\" (a closer calque: \"They were waiting and waiting.\")\n\n===''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2''===\nThe words ''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"''oo''\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"P\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"H\u00f4\" and \"oh\u00f2\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"p\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n*Example: \"''Pakitapon naman '''p\u00f4/ho''' yung basura.''\" (\"Please throw away the trash.\")\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n*Ex: \"''Gut\u00f3m ka na ba?\" \"'''Op\u00f2/Oh\u00f2'''''\". (\"Are you hungry yet?\" \"Yes.\")\n\n''P\u00f4/H\u00f4'' may also be used in negation.\n*Ex: \"''Hindi ko '''p\u00f4/h\u00f4''' alam 'yan.''\" (\"I don't know that.\")\n\n==Vocabulary and borrowed words==\n{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, the [[Silk Road]], the [[Tang Dynasty]], the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], the [[Spice Route]] and the [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Other examples of Tagalog words used in English\n! scope=\"col \" | Example\n! scope=\"col \" | Definition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[boondocks]]\n| meaning \"rural\" or \"back country,\" was imported by American soldiers stationed in the Philippines following the Spanish\u2013American War as a mispronounced version of the Tagalog ''bundok'', which means \"mountain.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | cogon\n| a type of grass, used for thatching.

The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> (\"the Bible\") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version\n* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]\n* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version\n* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Lord's Prayer===\nIn Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Am\u00e1 Namin'' (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\n{{Poemquote\n| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;\n| text=\nAm\u00e1 namin, sumasalangit Ka,\nSambah\u00edn ang ngalan Mo.\nMapasaamin ang kahari\u00e1n Mo.\nSund\u00edn ang lo\u00f3b Mo,\nDito sa lup\u00e0, gaya nang sa langit.\nBigy\u00e1n Mo kam\u00ed ngay\u00f3n ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,\nAt patawarin Mo kam\u00ed sa aming mga sal\u00e2,\nPara nang pagp\u00e1patawad namin,\nSa nagkakasal\u00e0 sa amin;\nAt huw\u00e1g Mo kam\u00edng ipahintulot sa tuks\u00f3,\nAt iady\u00e2 Mo kam\u00ed sa lah\u00e1t ng masam\u00e2.\n[Sapagk\u00e1t sa Iny\u00f3 ang kahari\u00e1n, at ang kapangyarihan,\nAt ang kaluw\u00e1lhatian, ngay\u00f3n, at magpakailanman.]\nAmen.\n}}\n\n===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\nThis is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''P\u00e1ngkalahat\u00e1ng Pagpapahayag ng Karapat\u00e1ng Pantao'')\n\n{{Verse translation\n| lang=tl\n| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may lay\u00e0 at magkakapant\u00e1y ang tagl\u00e1y na dang\u00e1l at karapat\u00e1n.

The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number \"seven\", it can be translated into Tagalog as \"''pito''\" or \"''siyete''\" (Spanish: ''siete'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Cardinal\n! scope=\"col\" | Spanish loanword<br />(Original Spanish)\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordinal\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 0\n| sero / wal\u00e2 (lit. \"null\") / aw\u00e1n\n| sero (cero)\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| is\u00e1\n| uno (uno)\n| una\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| dalaw\u00e1 [dalaua]\n| dos (dos)\n| pangalaw\u00e1 / ikalaw\u00e1 (informally, ikadalaw\u00e1)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| tatl\u00f3\n| tres (tres)\n| pangatl\u00f3 / ikatl\u00f3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| apat\n| kuwatro (cuatro)\n| pang-apat / ikaapat (\"ika\" and the number-word are never hyphenated.

{"title_page": "Historicity of King Arthur", "text_new": "[[File:KingArthurTombsite.jpg|thumb|The site of Arthur's purported grave in \"[[Avalon]]\" at [[Glastonbury Abbey]]]]\nThe '''historicity of King Arthur''' was debated among historians as recently as the 1970s. The academic consensus today is that is that there is no solid evidence for the historical existence of the [[King Arthur]] who inspired the mythological and folkloric figure of [[Arthurian Legend]], as the history [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] told in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' is false. However, historians generally agree there there was almost certainly an actual Arthur who inspired the legend.<ref>Mark, Joshua J. \"The Historical King Arthur.\" Ancient History Encyclopedia.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

''*Arto-r\u012bg-ios'' is unattested, but the root ''*arto-r\u012bg'' is the source of the [[Old Irish]] personal name ''Artr\u00ed''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'', ''Arthurus'', or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as ''Art\u014drius'' (although the Classical Latin ''Art\u014drius'' became ''Arturius'' in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, it may not refer to the origin of the name ''Arthur'', as ''Art\u014drius'' would regularly become ''Art(h)ur'' when borrowed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{citation |last=Koch |first=John T. |chapter=The Celtic Lands |editor-first=Norris J. |editor-last=Lacy |title = Medieval Arthurian Literature: A Guide to Recent Research |location = New York, NY |publisher = Garland |year= 1996 |page = 253 |isbn = 978-0-8153-2160-6 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] argued that the appearance of the name ''Arthur'' among Scottish and Welsh figures suggests the name became popular in early 6th-century Britain for a short time.

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Like the ''Annals'', all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.<ref name=\"Fletcher_17\" />\n\n===''Historia Regum Britanniae''===\nArthur was first styled as a [[king of the Britons]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-historical chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), which dates to c. 1136.{{NoteTag|''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' draws upon Gildas' ''De Excidio Britanniae'', the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Annales Cambriae'', among other sources.}} Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]], father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur.

The earliest of these would appear to be the Old Welsh poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', preserved in a 13th-century manuscript.

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, ''From Scythia to Camelot''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Littleton | first1 = C.

They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

''*Arto-r\u012bg-ios'' is unattested, but the root ''*arto-r\u012bg'' is the source of the [[Old Irish]] personal name ''Artr\u00ed''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'', ''Arthurus'', or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as ''Art\u014drius'' (although the Classical Latin ''Art\u014drius'' became ''Arturius'' in some Vulgar Latin dialects).

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Like the ''Annals'', all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.<ref name=\"Fletcher_17\" />\n\n===''Historia Regum Britanniae''===\nArthur was first styled as a [[king of the Britons]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-historical chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), which dates to c. 1136.{{NoteTag|''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' draws upon Gildas' ''De Excidio Britanniae'', the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Annales Cambriae'', among other sources.}} Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]], father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur.

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, ''From Scythia to Camelot''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Littleton | first1 = C.

They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century. This is the solution proposed by David F. Carroll (in his book ''Arturius: A Quest for Camelot'', 1996) and by [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]].<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book |last = Wood |first = Michael |title = In Search of Myths and Heroes |page = [https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 255] |year = 2007 |publisher = University of California Press |isbn = 978-0-520-25170-0 |url = https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[King Arthur's messianic return]]\n* [[Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} For example, Art\u00far mac Conaing,<ref>Senchus Fer Alban.

{"title_page": "Cloning vector", "text_new": "[[File:pBR322.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the [[pBR322]] plasmid, one of the first plasmids widely used as a cloning vector.]]\nA '''cloning vector''' is a small piece of [[DNA]] that can be stably maintained in an organism, and into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted for [[molecular cloning|cloning]] purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/genetics/#cloningvector |title=Definition of cloning vector |work=Genome Dictionary |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref> The cloning vector may be DNA taken from a [[virus]], the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] of a higher organism, or it may be the [[plasmid]] of a bacterium. The [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] therefore contains features that allow for the convenient insertion or removal of a DNA fragment to or from the vector, for example by treating the vector and the foreign DNA with a [[restriction enzyme]] that cuts the DNA.  DNA fragments thus generated contain either blunt ends or overhangs known as sticky ends, and vector DNA and foreign DNA with compatible ends can then be joined together by [[Ligation (molecular biology)|molecular ligation]].  After a DNA fragment has been cloned into a cloning vector, it may be further [[subcloned]] into another vector designed for more specific use.\n\nThere are many types of cloning vectors, but the most commonly used ones are genetically engineered [[plasmid]]s.  Cloning is generally first performed using ''[[Escherichia coli]]'',  and cloning vectors in ''E. coli'' include plasmids, [[bacteriophage]]s (such as [[Lambda phage|phage \u03bb]]), [[cosmids]], and [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs).  Some DNA, however, cannot be stably maintained in ''E. coli'', for example very large DNA fragments, and other organisms such as yeast may be used.  Cloning vectors in yeast include [[yeast artificial chromosome]]s (YACs).\n\n== Features of a cloning vector ==\nAll commonly used cloning vectors in [[molecular biology]] have key features necessary for their function, such as a suitable cloning site and selectable marker.  Others may have additional features specific to their use.  For reason of ease and convenience, cloning is often performed using ''[[E. coli]]''. Thus, the cloning vectors used often have elements necessary for their propagation and maintenance in ''E. coli'', such as a functional [[origin of replication]] (ori).  The [[ColE1]] origin of replication is found in many plasmids.  Some vectors also include elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism in addition to ''E. coli'', and these vectors are called [[shuttle vector]].\n\n===Cloning site===\nAll cloning vectors have features that allow a gene to be conveniently inserted into the vector or removed from it. This may be a [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS) or polylinker, which contains many unique [[restriction enzyme|restriction sites]].  The restriction sites in the MCS are first cleaved by restriction enzymes, then a [[PCR]]-amplified target gene also digested with the same enzymes is ligated into the vectors using [[DNA ligase]]. The target DNA sequence can be inserted into the vector in a specific direction if so desired.  The restriction sites may be further used for [[sub-cloning]] into another vector if necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gorman|display-authors=et al |title=Adaptability and reproducibility of alternative splice and restriction sites in differential cloning vectors: a study and literature review |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2015 |volume=30 |issue=19 |pages=120\u2013142}}</ref>\n\nOther cloning vectors may use [[topoisomerase]] instead of ligase and cloning may be done more rapidly without the need for restriction digest of the vector or insert.  In this [[TOPO cloning]] method a linearized vector is activated by attaching topoisomerase I to its ends, and this \"TOPO-activated\" vector may then accept a PCR product by ligating both the 5' ends of the PCR product, releasing the topoisomerase and forming a circular vector in the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Product-Brand/topo/The-Technology-Behind-TOPO-Cloning.html |title=The Technology Behind TOPO\u00ae Cloning |work=Invitrogen }}</ref>  Another method of cloning without the use of DNA digest and ligase is by [[Site-specific recombination|DNA recombination]], for example as used in the [[Gateway Technology|Gateway cloning system]].<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=Gateway cloning for protein expression |vauthors=Esposito D, Garvey LA, Chakiath CS |title=High Throughput Protein Expression and Purification |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |year=2009 |volume=498 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/highthroughputpr00shar/page/31 31\u201354] |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-196-3_3 |pmid=18988017 |isbn=978-1-58829-879-9 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/highthroughputpr00shar/page/31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/recombination/gateway/ |title=Cloning Methods - Recombination cloning systems |work=EMBL }}</ref> The gene, once cloned into the cloning vector (called entry clone in this method), may be conveniently introduced into a variety of expression vectors by recombination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cloning/Gateway-Cloning/Gateway-Technology.html |title=Gateway\u00ae Recombination Cloning Technology |work=Invitrogen}}</ref>\n\n===Selectable marker===\nA [[selectable marker]] is carried by the vector to allow the selection of positively [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] cells.  [[Antibiotic]] resistance is often used as marker, an example being the [[beta-lactamase]] gene, which confers resistance to  the [[penicillin]] group of [[beta-lactam antibiotics]] like [[ampicillin]].  Some vectors contain two selectable markers, for example the plasmid pACYC177 has both ampicillin and [[kanamycin]] resistance gene.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Nicola Casali |author2=Andrew Preston |title= ''E. coli'' plasmid vectors |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=235 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r6QC0hTwsrwC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-1-58829-151-6 |year=2003 }}</ref> Shuttle vector which is designed to be maintained in two different organisms may also require two selectable markers, although some selectable markers such as resistance to [[zeocin]] and [[hygromycin B]] are effective in different cell types.

Such features present in cloning vectors may be the [[lac operon|''lacZ''\u03b1 fragment]] for \u03b1 complementation in [[blue white screen|blue-white selection]], and/or [[marker gene]] or [[reporter gene]]s in frame with and flanking the [[Multiple cloning site|MCS]] to facilitate the production of [[fusion protein]]s.  Examples of fusion partners that may be used for screening are the [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) and [[luciferase]].\n\n===Elements for expression===\n{{main |Expression vector}}\nA cloning vector need not contain suitable elements for the [[Gene expression|expression]] of a cloned target gene, such as a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[ribosomal binding site]] (RBS),  many however do, and may then work as an [[expression vector]].  The target [[DNA]] may be inserted into a site that is under the control of a particular promoter necessary for the expression of the target gene in the chosen host.   Where the promoter is present, the expression of the gene is preferably tightly controlled and [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|inducible]] so that proteins are only produced when required.  Some commonly used promoters are the [[T7 phage|T7]] and [[lac operon|''lac'' promoters]].  The presence of a promoter is necessary when screening techniques such as [[Blue white screen|blue-white selection]] are used.\n\nCloning vectors without promoter and RBS for the cloned DNA sequence are sometimes used, for example when cloning genes whose products are toxic to ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' cells.  Promoter and RBS for the cloned DNA sequence are also unnecessary when first making a [[Genomic library|genomic]] or [[cDNA library]] of clones since the cloned genes are normally subcloned into a more appropriate expression vector if their expression is required.\n\nSome vectors are designed for transcription only with no heterologous protein expressed, for example for ''in vitro'' mRNA production.  These vectors are called transcription vectors.  They may lack the sequences necessary for polyadenylation and termination, therefore may not be used for protein production.\n\n==Types of cloning vectors==\nA large number of cloning vectors are available, and choosing the vector may depend a number of factors, such as the size of the insert, copy number and cloning method.  Large insert may not be stably maintained in a general cloning vector, especially for those with a high copy number, therefore cloning large fragments may require more specialized cloning vector.<ref name=\"methods in molbio\"/>\n\n[[File:PUC19.svg|thumb|The pUC plasmid has a high copy number, contains a multiple cloning site (polylinker), a gene for ampicillin antibiotic selection, and can be used for blue-white screen.]]\n\n===Plasmid===\n{{main|Plasmid vector}}\nPlasmids are autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA. They are the standard cloning vectors and the ones most commonly used.  Most general plasmids may be used to clone DNA insert of up to 15 kb in size.  One of the earliest commonly used cloning vectors is the [[pBR322]] plasmid.  Other cloning vectors include the [[pUC19|pUC]] series of plasmids, and a large number of different cloning plasmid vectors are available.  Many plasmids have high copy number, for example [[pUC19]] which has a copy number of 500-700 copies per cell,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1385-1592594093 |page=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1385-1592594093/page/n31 22] |title=E.

These are called [[phagemid]], and examples are the [[pBluescript]] series of cloning vectors.\n\n===Bacteriophage===\nThe bacteriophages used for cloning are the [[Bacteriophage lambda|phage \u03bb]] and [[M13 phage]].  There is an upper limit on the amount of DNA that can be packed into a phage (a maximum of 53 kb), therefore to allow foreign DNA to be inserted into phage DNA, phage cloning vectors may need to have some non-essential genes deleted, for example the genes for [[lysogeny]] since using phage \u03bb as a cloning vector involves only the lytic cycle.<ref>{{cite book |author1=B.

Insertion vectors contain a unique cleavage site whereby foreign DNA with size of 5\u201311 kb may be inserted.   In replacement vectors, the cleavage sites flank a region containing genes not essential for the lytic cycle, and this region may be deleted and replaced by the DNA insert in the cloning process, and a larger sized DNA of 8\u201324 kb may be inserted.<ref name=\"preston\"/>\n\nThere is also a lower size limit for DNA that can be packed into a phage, and vector DNA that is too small cannot be properly packaged into the phage.  This property can be used for selection - vector without insert may be too small, therefore only vectors with insert may be selected for propagation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis: An Introduction|author= TA Brown|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |page=100 |isbn= 978-1444334074 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Ju8XeJL9Fc4C&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false |date= 2010-04-19}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmid===\n[[Cosmids]] are plasmids that incorporate a segment of bacteriophage \u03bb DNA that has the cohesive end site (''cos'') which contains elements required for packaging DNA into \u03bb particles.

It can carry very large DNA fragment (there is no upper limit on size for practical purposes), therefore it does not have the problem of limited cloning capacity of other vectors, and it also avoids possible insertional mutagenesis caused by integration into host chromosomes by viral vector.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Human artificial chromosome (HAC) vector with a conditional centromere for correction of genetic deficiencies in human cells|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |vauthors=Kim JH, Kononenko A, Erliandri I, Kim TA, Nakano M, Iida Y, Barrett JC, Oshimura M, Masumoto H, Earnshaw WC, Larionov V, Kouprina N |date=Dec 13, 2011 |volume=108|issue=50 |pages=20048\u201353 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.1114483108 |pmid=22123967 |pmc=3250132 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A new generation of human artificial chromosomes for functional genomics and gene therapy |vauthors=Kouprina N, Earnshaw WC, Masumoto H, Larionov V |journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |year= 2013 |volume=70|issue=7 |pages=1135\u201348 | doi= 10.1007/s00018-012-1113-3 |pmid=22907415 |pmc=3522797}}</ref>\n\nAnimal and plant viral vectors\nViruses that infect plant and animal cells have also been manipulated to introduce foreign genes into plant and animal cells.

A vector based on Simian virus 40 (SV40) was used in first cloning experiment involving mammalian cells. A number of vectors based on other type of viruses like Adenoviruses and Papilloma virus have been used to clone genes in mammals. At present , retroviral vectors are popular for cloning genes in mammalian cells. In case of plants like Cauliflower mosaic virus , Tobacco mosaic virus and Gemini viruses have been used with limited success.\n[[File:Blue-white test.jpg|thumb|An LB agar plate showing the result of a blue white screen.   White colonies may contain an insert in the plasmid it carries, while the blue ones are unsuccessful clones.]]\n\n==Screening: example of the blue/white screen==\n{{main|Blue white screen}}\nMany general purpose vectors such as [[pUC19]] usually include a system for detecting the presence of a cloned DNA fragment, based on the loss of an easily scored phenotype. The most widely used is the gene coding for ''E. coli'' [[beta-galactosidase|\u03b2-galactosidase]], whose activity can easily be detected by the ability of the enzyme it encodes to hydrolyze the soluble, colourless substrate [[X-gal]] (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside) into an insoluble, blue product (5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro indigo). Cloning a fragment of DNA within the vector-based ''lacZ\u03b1'' sequence of the \u03b2-galactosidase prevents the production of an active enzyme. If X-gal is included in the selective agar plates, transformant colonies are generally blue in the case of a vector with no inserted DNA and white in the case of a vector containing a fragment of cloned DNA.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Vector (molecular biology)]]\n* [[Plant transformation vector]]\n* [[IMAGE cDNA clones]]\n* [[fosmid]]\n* [[Golden Gate Cloning]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Cloning]]\n[[Category:Plasmids]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:pBR322.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the [[pBR322]] plasmid, one of the first plasmids widely used as a cloning vector.]]\nA '''cloning vector''' is a small piece of [[DNA]] that can be stably maintained in an organism, and into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted for [[molecular cloning|cloning]] purposes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theodora.com/genetics/#cloningvector |title=Definition of cloning vector |work=Genome Dictionary |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref> The cloning vector may be DNA taken from a [[virus]], the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] of a higher organism, or it may be the [[plasmid]] of a bacterium. The [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] therefore contains features that allow for the convenient insertion or removal of a DNA fragment to or from the vector, for example by treating the vector and the foreign DNA with a [[restriction enzyme]] that cuts the DNA.  DNA fragments thus generated contain either blunt ends or overhangs known as sticky ends, and vector DNA and foreign DNA with compatible ends can then be joined together by [[Ligation (molecular biology)|molecular ligation]].  After a DNA fragment has been cloned into a cloning vector, it may be further [[subcloned]] into another vector designed for more specific use.\n\nThere are many types of cloning vectors, but the most commonly used ones are genetically engineered [[plasmid]]s.  Cloning is generally first performed using ''[[Escherichia coli]]'',  and cloning vectors in ''E. coli'' include plasmids, [[bacteriophage]]s (such as [[Lambda phage|phage \u03bb]]), [[cosmids]], and [[bacterial artificial chromosome]]s (BACs).  Some DNA, however, cannot be stably maintained in ''E. coli'', for example very large DNA fragments, and other organisms such as yeast may be used.  Cloning vectors in yeast include [[yeast artificial chromosome]]s (YACs).\n\n== Features of a cloning vector ==\nAll commonly used cloning vectors in [[molecular biology]] have key features necessary for their function, such as a suitable cloning site and selectable marker.  Others may have additional features specific to their use.  For reason of ease and convenience, cloning is often performed using ''[[E. coli]]''. Thus, the cloning vectors used often have elements necessary for their propagation and maintenance in ''E. coli'', such as a functional [[origin of replication]] (ori).  The [[ColE1]] origin of replication is found in many plasmids.  Some vectors also include elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism in addition to ''E. coli'', and these vectors are called [[shuttle vector]].\n\n===Cloning site===\nAll cloning vectors have features that allow a gene to be conveniently inserted into the vector or removed from it. This may be a [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS) or polylinker, which contains many unique [[restriction enzyme|restriction sites]].  The restriction sites in the MCS are first cleaved by restriction enzymes, then a [[PCR]]-amplified target gene also digested with the same enzymes is ligated into the vectors using [[DNA ligase]]. The target DNA sequence can be inserted into the vector in a specific direction if so desired.  The restriction sites may be further used for [[sub-cloning]] into another vector if necessary.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gorman|display-authors=et al |title=Adaptability and reproducibility of alternative splice and restriction sites in differential cloning vectors: a study and literature review |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2015 |volume=30 |issue=19 |pages=120\u2013142}}</ref>\n\nOther cloning vectors may use [[topoisomerase]] instead of ligase and cloning may be done more rapidly without the need for restriction digest of the vector or insert.  In this [[TOPO cloning]] method a linearized vector is activated by attaching topoisomerase I to its ends, and this \"TOPO-activated\" vector may then accept a PCR product by ligating both the 5' ends of the PCR product, releasing the topoisomerase and forming a circular vector in the process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Product-Brand/topo/The-Technology-Behind-TOPO-Cloning.html |title=The Technology Behind TOPO\u00ae Cloning |work=Invitrogen }}</ref>  Another method of cloning without the use of DNA digest and ligase is by [[Site-specific recombination|DNA recombination]], for example as used in the [[Gateway Technology|Gateway cloning system]].<ref>{{Cite book |chapter=Gateway cloning for protein expression |vauthors=Esposito D, Garvey LA, Chakiath CS |title=High Throughput Protein Expression and Purification |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |year=2009 |volume=498 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/highthroughputpr00shar/page/31 31\u201354] |doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-196-3_3 |pmid=18988017 |isbn=978-1-58829-879-9 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/highthroughputpr00shar/page/31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/recombination/gateway/ |title=Cloning Methods - Recombination cloning systems |work=EMBL }}</ref> The gene, once cloned into the cloning vector (called entry clone in this method), may be conveniently introduced into a variety of expression vectors by recombination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cloning/Gateway-Cloning/Gateway-Technology.html |title=Gateway\u00ae Recombination Cloning Technology |work=Invitrogen}}</ref>\n\n===Selectable marker===\nA [[selectable marker]] is carried by the vector to allow the selection of positively [[Transformation (genetics)|transformed]] cells.  [[Antibiotic]] resistance is often used as marker, an example being the [[beta-lactamase]] gene, which confers resistance to  the [[penicillin]] group of [[beta-lactam antibiotics]] like [[ampicillin]].  Some vectors contain two selectable markers, for example the plasmid pACYC177 has both ampicillin and [[kanamycin]] resistance gene.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Nicola Casali |author2=Andrew Preston |title= ''E. coli'' plasmid vectors |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=235 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r6QC0hTwsrwC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-1-58829-151-6 |year=2003 }}</ref> Shuttle vector which is designed to be maintained in two different organisms may also require two selectable markers, although some selectable markers such as resistance to [[zeocin]] and [[hygromycin B]] are effective in different cell types.

Such features present in cloning vectors may be the [[lac operon|''lacZ''\u03b1 fragment]] for \u03b1 complementation in [[blue white screen|blue-white selection]], and/or [[marker gene]] or [[reporter gene]]s in frame with and flanking the [[Multiple cloning site|MCS]] to facilitate the production of [[fusion protein]]s.  Examples of fusion partners that may be used for screening are the [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) and [[luciferase]].\n\n===Elements for expression===\n{{main |Expression vector}}\nA cloning vector need not contain suitable elements for the [[Gene expression|expression]] of a cloned target gene, such as a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[ribosomal binding site]] (RBS),  many however do, and may then work as an [[expression vector]].  The target [[DNA]] may be inserted into a site that is under the control of a particular promoter necessary for the expression of the target gene in the chosen host.   Where the promoter is present, the expression of the gene is preferably tightly controlled and [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|inducible]] so that proteins are only produced when required.  Some commonly used promoters are the [[T7 phage|T7]] and [[lac operon|''lac'' promoters]].  The presence of a promoter is necessary when screening techniques such as [[Blue white screen|blue-white selection]] are used.\n\nCloning vectors without promoter and RBS for the cloned DNA sequence are sometimes used, for example when cloning genes whose products are toxic to ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' cells.  Promoter and RBS for the cloned DNA sequence are also unnecessary when first making a [[Genomic library|genomic]] or [[cDNA library]] of clones since the cloned genes are normally subcloned into a more appropriate expression vector if their expression is required.\n\nSome vectors are designed for transcription only with no heterologous protein expressed, for example for ''in vitro'' mRNA production.  These vectors are called transcription vectors.  They may lack the sequences necessary for polyadenylation and termination, therefore may not be used for protein production.\n\n==Types of cloning vectors==\nA large number of cloning vectors are available, and choosing the vector may depend a number of factors, such as the size of the insert, copy number and cloning method.  Large insert may not be stably maintained in a general cloning vector, especially for those with a high copy number, therefore cloning large fragments may require more specialized cloning vector.<ref name=\"methods in molbio\"/>\n\n[[File:PUC19.svg|thumb|The pUC plasmid has a high copy number, contains a multiple cloning site (polylinker), a gene for ampicillin antibiotic selection, and can be used for blue-white screen.]]\n\n===Plasmid===\n{{main|Plasmid vector}}\nPlasmids are autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA. They are the standard cloning vectors and the ones most commonly used.  Most general plasmids may be used to clone DNA insert of up to 15 kb in size.  One of the earliest commonly used cloning vectors is the [[pBR322]] plasmid.  Other cloning vectors include the [[pUC19|pUC]] series of plasmids, and a large number of different cloning plasmid vectors are available.  Many plasmids have high copy number, for example [[pUC19]] which has a copy number of 500-700 copies per cell,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1385-1592594093 |page=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1385-1592594093/page/n31 22] |title=E.

These are called [[phagemid]], and examples are the [[pBluescript]] series of cloning vectors.\n\n===Bacteriophage===\nThe bacteriophages used for cloning are the [[Bacteriophage lambda|phage \u03bb]] and [[M13 phage]].  There is an upper limit on the amount of DNA that can be packed into a phage (a maximum of 53 kb), therefore to allows foreign DNA to be inserted into phage DNA, phage cloning vectors may need to have some non-essential genes deleted, for example the genes for [[lysogeny]] since using phage \u03bb as a cloning vector involves only the lytic cycle.<ref>{{cite book |author1=B.

Insertion vectors contain a unique cleavage site whereby foreign DNA with size of 5\u201311 kb may be inserted.   In replacement vectors, the cleavage sites flank a region containing genes not essential for the lytic cycle, and this region may be deleted and replaced by the DNA insert in the cloning process, and a larger sized DNA of 8\u201324 kb may be inserted.<ref name=\"preston\"/>\n\nThere is also a lower size limit for DNA that can be packed into a phage, and vector DNA that is too small cannot be properly packaged into the phage.  This property can be used for selection - vector without insert may be too small, therefore only vectors with insert may be selected for propagation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis: An Introduction|author= TA Brown|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |page=100 |isbn= 978-1444334074 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Ju8XeJL9Fc4C&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false |date= 2010-04-19}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmid===\n[[Cosmids]] are plasmids that incorporate a segment of bacteriophage \u03bb DNA that has the cohesive end site (''cos'') which contains elements required for packaging DNA into \u03bb particles.

One of four {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruisers|2}} ordered in mid-1916, ''Hood'' had design limitations, though her design was revised after the [[Battle of Jutland]] and improved while she was under construction. For this reason, she was the only ship of her class to be completed. Despite the appearance of new and more modern ship designs over time, ''Hood'' remained the largest warship in the world for 20 years after her commissioning, and her prestige was reflected in her nickname, \"The Mighty Hood\".\n\n''Hood'' was involved in several [[wikt:show the flag|showing-the-flag]] exercises between her commissioning in 1920 and the outbreak of war in 1939, including training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and a circumnavigation of the globe with the [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|Special Service Squadron]] in 1923 and 1924. She was attached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] following the outbreak of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, ''Hood'' was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until she had to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul. By this time, advances in naval gunnery had reduced ''Hood''{{'}}s usefulness. She was scheduled to undergo a major rebuild in 1941 to correct these issues, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 forced the ship into service without the upgrades.\n\nWhen war with Germany was declared, ''Hood'' was operating in the area around [[Iceland]], and she spent the next several months hunting for German [[commerce raider]]s and [[blockade runner]]s between Iceland and the [[Norwegian Sea]]. After a brief overhaul of her propulsion system, she sailed as the [[flagship]] of [[Force H]], and participated in the [[destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir]]. Relieved as flagship of Force H, ''Hood'' was dispatched to [[Scapa Flow]], and operated in the area as a convoy escort and later as a defence against a potential German invasion fleet. In May 1941, ''Hood'' and the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} were ordered to intercept the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, which were en route to the Atlantic, where they were to attack convoys. On 24 May 1941, early in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], ''Hood'' was struck by several German shells, exploded, and sank within 3 minutes, with the loss of all but three of her crew. Due to her publicly perceived invincibility, the loss affected British morale.\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] conducted two inquiries into the reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that ''Hood''{{'}}s aft [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] had exploded after one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's [[torpedo]]es. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's [[gun turret]]s that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.\n\n==Design and description==\n{{Main|Admiral-class battlecruiser}}\n[[File:HMS Hood (1921) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Profile drawing of ''Hood'' as she was in 1921, in Atlantic Fleet dark grey]]\n\nThe'' Admiral''-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the German {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|2}}s, which were reported to be more heavily armed and armoured than the latest British battlecruisers of the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|5}} and the {{sclass-|Courageous|battlecruiser|4}}es. The design was revised after the Battle of Jutland to incorporate heavier armour and all four ships were laid down. Only ''Hood'' was completed, because the ships were very expensive and required labour and material that could be put to better use building merchant ships needed to replace those lost to the [[Atlantic U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]].<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\n''Hood'' was significantly larger than her predecessors of the ''Renown'' class. As completed, she had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|860|ft|7|in|1}}, a maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|104|ft|2|in|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|32|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. This was {{convert|110|ft|m|1}} longer and {{convert|14|ft|m|1}} wider than the older ships. She displaced {{convert|42670|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|46680|LT|t}} at deep load, over {{convert|13000|LT|t|-1}} more than the older ships. The ship had a complete [[double bottom]]. ''Hood'' had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|4.2|ft|1}} at deep load,<ref name=rr67>Raven and Roberts, p. 67</ref> which minimised her roll and made her a steady gun platform.\n\nThe additional armour added during construction increased her draught by about {{convert|4|ft}} at deep load, which reduced her [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and made her very wet. At full speed, or in heavy seas, water would flow over the ship's [[quarterdeck]] and often entered the [[messdeck]]s and living quarters through ventilation shafts.<ref>Taylor, pp. 92, 94</ref> This characteristic earned her the nickname of \"the largest submarine in the Navy\".<ref>Taylor, p. 92</ref> The persistent dampness, coupled with the ship's poor ventilation, was blamed for the high incidence of [[tuberculosis]] aboard.<ref>Taylor, p. 123</ref> The ship's complement varied widely over her career; in 1919, she was authorised 1433 men as a squadron flagship; in 1934, she had 81 officers and 1244 men aboard.<ref>Taylor, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe propulsion system consisted of 24 [[Yarrow boiler]]s, connected to Brown-Curtis geared [[steam turbine]]s driving four propellers. The battlecruiser's turbines were designed to produce {{convert|144000|shp|lk=in}}, which would propel the ship at {{convert|31|kn|lk=in}}, but during [[sea trial]]s in 1920, ''Hood''{{'}}s turbines provided {{convert|151280|shp|abbr=on}}, which allowed her to reach {{convert|32.07|kn}}. She carried about {{convert|3895|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 76, 79, 80</ref> which gave an estimated range of {{convert|7500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}.<ref name=\"rr67\"/>\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:HMS Hood Aft guns 1926 USNHC 57184.jpg|thumb|300px|A close-up of ''Hood''{{'}}s aft [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch Mark I guns]] in 1926.]]\n''Hood'' carried eight 42-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[British ordnance terms#BL|BL]] [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch Mk I guns]] in hydraulically powered twin [[gun turret]]s.

The turrets were designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear,<ref>Campbell, pp. 25\u201328</ref><ref>Roberts 1997, p. 89</ref> and 120 shells were carried for each gun.<ref name=\"rr67\"/>\n\n''Hood''{{'}}s secondary armament was a dozen 50-calibre [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, each with 200 rounds.<ref name=\"rr67\"/> They were shipped on [[gun shield|shielded]] single-[[pivot gun|pivot mounts]] fitted along the upper deck and the forward shelter deck. This high position allowed them to be worked during heavy weather, as they were less affected by waves and spray compared with the [[casemate]] mounts of earlier British [[capital ship]]s.<ref name=\"b97\"/> Two of these guns on the shelter deck were temporarily replaced by [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk V]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|antiaircraft]] (AA) guns between 1938 and 1939. All the 5.5-inch guns were removed during another refit in 1940.<ref name=\"secondaryguns\" /> The gun fired an {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell to a maximum range of {{convert|17770|yd}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe original antiaircraft armament consisted of four QF 4-inch Mk V guns on single mounts. These were joined in early 1939 by four twin mounts for the 45-calibre [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark XVI]] [[dual-purpose gun]]. The single guns were removed in mid-1939 and a further three twin Mark XIX mounts were added in early 1940.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 193, 195</ref> This mounting could elevate from \u221210 to +80\u00b0. The Mk XVI gun fired about twelve {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[British ordnance terms#HE|high-explosive]] shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets, it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|39000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref>\n\nIn 1931, a pair of octuple mountings for the {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|1}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun]] were added on the shelter deck, abreast of the funnels, and a third mount was added in 1937.<ref name=rr95>Raven and Roberts, p. 195</ref> These gun mounts could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of +80\u00b0.

The gun's rate of fire was around 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nTwo quadruple mountings for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers {{convert|0.5|in|1|adj=on}} Mk III]] machine gun were added in 1933 with two more mountings added in 1937.<ref name=rr95/> These mounts could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of +70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range around {{convert|5000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> To these were added five [[unrotated projectile]] launchers in 1940, each launcher carrying 20 {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} rockets.<ref name=rr95/> When they detonated, the rockets shot out lengths of cable that were kept aloft by [[parachute]]s; the cable was intended to snag aircraft and draw up the small aerial mine that would destroy the aircraft.<ref>Campbell, p. 100</ref>\n\nSix fixed {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted on ''Hood'', three on each [[broadside]]. Two of these were submerged forward of 'A' turret's [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and the other four were above water, [[wikt:abaft|abaft]] the rear funnel.<ref name=\"rr67\"/> The [[British 21 inch torpedo|Mk IV torpedoes]] had a warhead of {{convert|515|lb}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. They had two speed and range settings \u2013 {{convert|25|kn}} with a maximum range of {{convert|13500|yd}} or {{convert|40|kn}} to {{convert|5000|yd}}. About 28 torpedoes were carried.<ref>Roberts 2001, pp. 17\u201318</ref>\n\n===Fire control===\n[[File:HMS Hood h60450.jpg|thumb|300px|An aerial view of ''Hood'' in 1924: The two forward gun turrets are visible with their prominent rangefinders projecting from the rear of the turret. Behind the turret is the conning tower surmounted by the main fire-control director with its own rangefinder. The secondary director is mounted on top of the spotting top on the tripod foremast.]]\n\n''Hood'' was completed with two [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]]. One was mounted above the [[conning tower]], protected by an armoured hood, and was fitted with a {{convert|30|ft|1|adj=on}} [[rangefinder]]. The other was fitted in the [[Top (sailing ship)|spotting top]] above the tripod [[foremast]] and equipped with a {{convert|15|ft|1|adj=on}} rangefinder. Each turret was also fitted with a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinder. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. They were supplemented by two additional control positions in the fore-top, which were provided with {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on|1}} rangefinders, fitted in 1924\u201325.<ref name=b97>Burt, p. 297</ref> The antiaircraft guns were controlled by a simple high-angle {{convert|2|m|ftin|adj=on}} rangefinder mounted on the aft control position,<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 68</ref> fitted in 1926\u20131927. Three torpedo-control towers were fitted, each with a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinder. One was on each side of the amidships control tower and the third was on the centreline abaft the aft control position.<ref name=b97/>\n\nDuring the 1929\u201331 refit, a [[HACS|high-angle control system]] (HACS) Mark I director was added on the rear searchlight platform and two positions for 2-pounder \"pom-pom\" antiaircraft directors were added at the rear of the spotting top, although only one director was initially fitted.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 189</ref> The 5.5-inch control positions and their rangefinders on the spotting top were removed during the 1932 refit. In 1934, the \"pom-pom\" directors were moved to the former locations of the 5.5-inch control positions on the spotting top and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinders for the 5.5-inch control positions were reinstalled on the signal platform. Two years later, the \"pom-pom\" directors were moved to the rear corners of the bridge to get them out of the funnel gases. Another \"pom-pom\" director was added on the rear superstructure, abaft the HACS director in 1938. Two HACS Mark III directors were added to the aft end of the signal platform the following year, and the Mark I director aft was replaced by a Mark III.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 189\u2013195</ref> During ''Hood''{{'}}s last refit in 1941, a [[Type 279 radar|Type 279]] air warning radar and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 284|Type 284]] gunnery radar were installed,<ref>Burt, p. 308</ref> although the Type 279 radar lacked its receiving aerial and was inoperable according to Roberts.<ref name=r1/>\n\nHowever, Admiralty document ADM 220/76 \"Reports of performance in H.M.S. Hood, H.M.S. Illustrious, H.M.S. King George V and smaller vessels of RDF279\"<ref>http://www.hmshood.org.uk/reference/official/adm220/adm220-76.htm</ref> indicates that, following the 1941 refit at Rosyth, ''Hood''{{'}}s Type 279 radar was indeed functional. According to the HMS ''Hood'' Association website,<ref>http://www.hmshood.com/ship/radar.htm</ref> the air warning radar was of a modified type, known as Type 279M, the difference between this and Type 279 being the number of aerials. While Type 279 used two aerials, a transmitter and a receiver, the Type 279M used only a single transceiver aerial. ''Hood'' reported an accuracy of 3 degrees with her 279M set.\n\n===Protection===\n''Hood''{{'}}s armour scheme was originally based on that of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}} with an {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} [[Belt armor|waterline belt]]. Unlike on ''Tiger'', the armour was angled outwards 12\u00b0 from the waterline to increase its relative thickness in relation to flat-trajectory shells. This change increased the ship's vulnerability to [[plunging fire|plunging]] (high-trajectory) shells, as it exposed more of the vulnerable deck armour. {{convert|5000|LT|t}} of armour were added to the design in late 1916, based on British experiences at the [[Battle of Jutland]], at the cost of deeper draught and slightly decreased speed.\n\nTo save construction time, this was accomplished by thickening the existing armour, rather than redesigning the entire ship.<ref>Burt, pp. 297\u2013298</ref> ''Hood''{{'}}s protection accounted for 33% of her displacement, a high proportion by British standards, but less than was usual in contemporary German designs (for example, 36% for the battlecruiser {{SMS|Hindenburg}}).<ref>Friedman, pp. 168\u2013169, 171\u2013172</ref>\n\nThe armoured belt consisted of face-hardened [[Krupp cemented armour]] (KC), arranged in three [[strake]]s. The main waterline belt was 12&nbsp;inches (305&nbsp;mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' [[barbette]]s and thinned to 5 to 6&nbsp;inches (127 to 152&nbsp;mm) towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7&nbsp;inches (178&nbsp;mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5&nbsp;inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102&nbsp;mm) extension aft.<ref>Roberts 1997, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe gun turrets and barbettes were protected by {{convert|11|to|15|in|mm|0}} of KC armour, except for the turret roofs, which were 5 inches thick. The decks were made of high-tensile steel. The [[forecastle]] deck ranged from 1.75 to 2.0&nbsp;inches (44 to 51&nbsp;mm) in thickness, while the upper deck was 2&nbsp;inches (51&nbsp;mm) thick over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and 0.75&nbsp;inches (19&nbsp;mm) elsewhere. The main deck was 3&nbsp;inches (76&nbsp;mm) thick over the magazines and 1&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm) elsewhere, except for the 2-inch-thick slope that met the bottom of the main belt. The lower deck was 3&nbsp;inches thick over the [[propeller shaft]]s, 2&nbsp;inches thick over the magazines and 1&nbsp;inch elsewhere.<ref name=b99>Burt, p. 299</ref>\n\nThe 3-inch plating on the main deck was added at a very late stage of construction and the four aftermost 5.5-inch guns and their ammunition hoists were removed in partial compensation. Live-firing trials with the new 15-inch APC (armour-piercing, capped) shell against a mock-up of ''Hood'' showed that this shell could penetrate the ship's vitals via the 7-inch middle belt and the 2-inch slope of the main deck. A proposal was made to increase the armour over the forward magazines to 5&nbsp;inches and 6&nbsp;inches over the rear magazines in July 1919 in response to these trials. To compensate for the additional weight, the two submerged torpedo tubes and the armour for the rear torpedo warheads were removed, and the armour for the aft torpedo-control tower was reduced in thickness from 6 to {{convert|1.5|in}}. However, the additional armour was never fitted pending further trials.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 68\u201369</ref> As completed, ''Hood'' remained susceptible to plunging shells and bombs.<ref name=b99/> The torpedo warhead armour was reinstated during the ship's 1929\u20131931 refit.<ref name=r1>Roberts 2001, p. 21</ref>\n\nFor protection against torpedoes, she was given a {{convert|7.5|ft|1|adj=on}}<ref name=b99/> deep [[torpedo bulge]] that ran the length of the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into an empty outer compartment and an inner compartment filled with five rows of water-tight \"crushing tubes\" intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The bulge was backed by a 1.5-inch-thick [[torpedo bulkhead]].<ref>Roberts 1997, p. 111</ref>\n\n===Aircraft===\n''Hood'' was initially fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on top of 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which [[Fairey Flycatcher]]s could launch.<ref>Taylor, p. 78</ref> During her 1929\u201331 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] was installed on her [[quarterdeck]], along with a crane to recover a [[seaplane]]. She embarked a [[Fairey III]]F from No. 444 Flight of the [[Royal Air Force]]. During the 1932 [[West Indies]] cruise, the catapult proved to be difficult to operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Battlecruiser or fast battleship===\nAlthough the Royal Navy always designated ''Hood'' as a battlecruiser, some modern writers such as [[Anthony Preston (naval historian)|Anthony Preston]] have classified her as a [[fast battleship]], since ''Hood'' appeared to have improvements over the fast {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s. On paper, ''Hood'' retained the same armament and level of protection, while being significantly faster.<ref name=\"hmshood.com\"/><ref>Preston 2002, p. 96</ref>\n\nAround 1918, American commanders, including Vice Admiral [[William Sims]], commander of US naval forces in Europe, and Admiral [[Henry T. Mayo]], commander of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], became extremely impressed by ''Hood'', which they described as a \"fast battleship\", and they advocated that the US Navy develop a fast battleship of its own.<ref>Hone, p. 23</ref> However, the US continued with their established design direction, the slower, but well-protected {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} battleship and the fast and lightly armoured {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|2}}, both of which were later cancelled in accordance with the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 76</ref>\n\nInfluences from ''Hood'' showed on subsequent ''Lexington'' designs, with the reduction of the main armour belt, the change to \"[[sloped armour]]\", and the addition of four above-water torpedo tubes to the four underwater tubes of the original design.<ref>Morison and Polmar, pp. 71\u201372</ref> To add to the confusion, Royal Navy documents of the period often describe any battleship with a maximum speed over {{convert|24|kn}} as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour. For instance, the never-built [[G3 battlecruiser]] was classified as such, although it would have been more of a fast battleship than ''Hood''.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe scale of ''Hood''{{'}}s protection, though adequate for the Jutland era, was at best marginal against the new generation of {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} gunned capital ships that emerged soon after her completion in 1920, typified by the American {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|0}} and the Japanese {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|2}}s. The Royal Navy were fully aware that the ship's protection flaws still remained, even in her revised design, so ''Hood'' was intended for the duties of a battlecruiser and she served in the battlecruiser squadrons through most of her career. Late in her career, ''Hood'' was outclassed by the armour and protective arrangement of World War II-era fast battleships, but few available \"big gun\" vessels could match ''Bismarck''{{'}}s speed, and in 1941, the Admiralty included ''Hood'' among the ships sent to engage the German battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''.<ref name=\"hmshood.com\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nConstruction of ''Hood'' began at the [[John Brown & Company]] shipyards in [[Clydebank]], Scotland, on 1 September 1916. Following the loss of three British battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland, 5,000&nbsp;tons of extra armour and bracing were added to ''Hood''{{'}}s design.<ref>Burt, p. 298</ref> Most seriously, the deck protection was flawed\u2014spread over three decks, it was designed to detonate an incoming shell on impact with the top deck, with much of the energy being absorbed as the exploding shell had to penetrate the armour of the next two decks. The development of effective time-delay shells at the end of [[World War I]] made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship.<ref>Brown, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.<ref name=\"hmshood.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmshood.com/history/construct/design.htm|title=Designing HMS ''Hood''|date=30 November 2008|publisher=HMS Hood Association|accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nShe was launched on 22 August 1918 by the widow of Rear Admiral Sir [[Horace Hood]], a great-great-grandson of Admiral Samuel Hood, after whom the ship was named. Sir Horace Hood had been killed while commanding the [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] and flying his flag on {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}}\u2014one of the three battlecruisers which blew up at the Battle of Jutland. To make room in John Brown's shipyard for merchant construction, ''Hood'' sailed for [[Rosyth]] to complete her [[fitting-out]] on 9 January 1920.<ref>Taylor, pp. 15, 19</ref> After [[sea trial]]s, she was commissioned on 15 May 1920, under [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Wilfred Tompkinson. She had cost [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]6,025,000 to build.<ref>Parkes, p. 644</ref>\n\nWith her conspicuous twin funnels and lean profile, ''Hood'' was widely regarded one of the finest-looking warships ever built. She was also the largest warship afloat when she was commissioned, and retained that distinction for the next 20 years.<ref>Burt, pp. 295, 303</ref> Her size and powerful armament earned her the nickname of \"Mighty Hood\" and she came to symbolise the might of the British Empire itself.<ref>Taylor, p. 20</ref>\n\n==Interwar service==\n[[File:HMS Hood in Sydney Harbour.jpeg|thumb|HMS ''Hood'' in [[Sydney Harbour]] shortly after arriving with the other ships of the [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|Special Service Squadron]] during their world tour, on 9 April 1924]]\n\nShortly after commissioning on 15 May 1920, ''Hood'' became the flagship of the [[Battlecruiser Squadron]] of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] Sir [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]]. After a cruise to Scandinavian waters that year, Captain Geoffrey Mackworth assumed command. ''Hood'' visited the [[Mediterranean]] in 1921 and 1922 to show the flag and to train with the Mediterranean fleet, before sailing on a cruise to Brazil and the West Indies in company with the battlecruiser squadron.<ref>Taylor, pp. 234\u2013235</ref>\n\nCaptain [[John Knowles Im Thurn|John im Thurn]] was in command when ''Hood'', accompanied by the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} and {{sclass-|Danae|cruiser|2}}s of the [[1st Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Light Cruiser Squadron]], set out [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|on a world cruise]] from west to east via the [[Panama Canal]] in November 1923. The objective of the cruise was to remind the [[dominion]]s of their dependence on British sea power and encourage them to support it with money, ships, and facilities. They returned home 10 months later in September 1924, having visited [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British India|India]], Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and some smaller colonies and dependencies, and the United States.<ref>Taylor, pp. 70, 236</ref>\n\nWhile in Australia in April 1924, the squadron escorted the battlecruiser {{HMAS|Australia|1911|6}} out to sea, where she was [[scuttled]] in compliance with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].<ref>Bastock, p. 38</ref> The battlecruiser squadron visited [[Lisbon]] in January 1925 to participate in the [[Vasco da Gama]] celebrations before continuing on to the Mediterranean for exercises. ''Hood'' continued this pattern of a winter training visit to the Mediterranean for the rest of the decade. Captain Harold Reinold relieved Captain im Thurn on 30 April 1925 and was relieved in turn by Captain [[Wilfred French]] on 21 May 1927.<ref>Taylor, pp. 236\u2013238</ref>\n\n''Hood'' was given a major refit from 1 May 1929 to 10 March 1931, and afterwards resumed her role as flagship of the battlecruiser squadron under the command of Captain [[Julian Patterson]]. Later that year, her crew participated in the [[Invergordon Mutiny]] over pay cuts for the sailors. It ended peacefully and ''Hood'' returned to her home port afterwards. The battlecruiser squadron made a Caribbean cruise in early 1932, and ''Hood'' was given another brief refit between 31 March and 10 May at [[Portsmouth]]. Captain Thomas Binney assumed command on 15 August 1932 and the ship resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in the Mediterranean the next year. Captain Thomas Tower replaced Captain Binney on 30 August 1933. Her secondary and antiaircraft fire-control directors were rearranged during another quick refit between 1 August and 5 September 1934.<ref>Taylor, pp. 237\u2013238</ref>\n\nWhile en route to [[Gibraltar]] for a Mediterranean cruise, ''Hood'' was rammed in the port side [[quarterdeck]] by the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} on 23 January 1935. The damage to ''Hood'' was limited to her left outer propeller and an 18-inch (460&nbsp;mm) dent, although some hull plates were knocked loose from the impact. Temporary repairs were made at Gibraltar before the ship sailed to Portsmouth for permanent repairs between February and May 1935. The captains of both ships were [[court-martial]]led, as was the squadron commander, Rear Admiral Sidney Bailey. Tower and Bailey were acquitted, but ''Renown''{{'}}s Captain Sawbridge was relieved of command. The Admiralty dissented from the verdict, reinstated Sawbridge, and criticised Bailey for ambiguous signals during the manoeuvre.<ref>Taylor, pp. 165\u2013166, 167</ref>\n\nThe ship participated in [[King George V]]'s Silver Jubilee [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] the following August. She was attached to the Mediterranean fleet shortly afterwards and stationed at Gibraltar at the outbreak of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in October. Captain [[Arthur Pridham]] assumed command on 1 February 1936 and ''Hood'' returned to Portsmouth for a brief refit between 26 June and 10 October 1936. She formally transferred to the Mediterranean fleet on 20 October, shortly after the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>Burt, pp. 309\u2013310</ref> On 23 April 1937, the ship escorted three British merchantmen into [[Bilbao]] harbour despite the presence of the [[Spanish State|Nationalist]] cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Almirante Cervera||2}} that attempted to blockade the port.<ref>Taylor, pp. 172\u2013173, 238\u2013240</ref> ''Hood'' was refitted at Malta in November and December 1937, and had her submerged torpedo tubes removed.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 191</ref> Captain Pridham was relieved by Captain Harold Walker on 20 May 1938 and he, in turn, was relieved when the ship returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August.<ref>Taylor, p. 240</ref>\n\n''Hood'' was due to be modernised in 1941 to bring her up to a standard similar to that of other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin [[QF 5.25-inch naval gun|5.25-inch gun turrets]], and six octuple [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder pom-poms]]. Her 5-inch upper-armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition, the conning tower would have been removed and her [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] rebuilt.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 195\u2013197</ref> The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast [[capital ship]], meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s, she was in need of a lengthy overhaul. The outbreak of World War II made removing her from service near impossible, and as a consequence, she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} and several of the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 197</ref> The ship's condensers were in such bad condition by this time that much of the output from the fresh-water evaporators was required to replenish the boiler feed water and could not be used by the crew to wash and bathe or even to heat the mess decks during cold weather, as the steam pipes were too leaky. These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.<ref>Taylor, p. 39</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nCaptain [[Irvine Glennie]] assumed command in May 1939 and ''Hood'' was assigned to the Home Fleet's Battlecruiser Squadron while still refitting. When war broke out later that year, she was employed principally to patrol in the vicinity of [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] to protect convoys and intercept German [[merchant raider]]s and [[blockade runner]]s attempting to break out into the Atlantic. On 25 September 1939, the Home Fleet sortied into the central [[North Sea]] to cover the return of the damaged submarine {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|2}}. The fleet was spotted by the Germans and attacked by aircraft from the [[Kampfgeschwader 26|KG 26]] and [[Kampfgeschwader 30|KG 30]] bomber wings. ''Hood'' was hit by a 250&nbsp;kg (550&nbsp;lb) bomb from a [[Junkers Ju 88]] [[bomber]] that damaged her port torpedo bulge and her condensers. By early 1940, ''Hood''{{'}}s machinery was in dire shape and limited her best speed to {{convert|26.5|kn}}; she was refitted between 4 April and 12 June.<ref>Taylor, pp. 192, 240\u2013241</ref>\n\n===Operation Catapult===\n''Hood'' and the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} were ordered to Gibraltar to join [[Force H]] on 18 June where ''Hood'' became the flagship. Force H took part in the [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] in July 1940. Just eight days after the French surrender, the British Admiralty issued an ultimatum that the French fleet at [[Oran]] intern its ships in a British or neutral port to ensure they would not fall into [[Axis powers|Axis]] hands. The terms were rejected and the Royal Navy opened fire on the French ships berthed there. The results of ''Hood''{{'}}s fire are not known exactly, but she damaged the {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque}}, which was hit by four fifteen-inch shells and was forced to beach herself. ''Hood'' was [[wikt:straddle|straddled]] during the engagement by ''Dunkerque''; shell splinters wounded two men. ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s [[sister ship]], {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}}, managed to escape from the harbour. ''Hood'' and several light cruisers gave chase, but gave up after two hours: ''Hood'' had dodged a salvo of torpedoes from a French [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] and had stripped a turbine reaching {{convert|28|kn}}.<ref>Taylor, pp. 202\u2013203</ref>\n\n===Return to home waters===\n''Hood'' was relieved as flagship of Force H by ''Renown'' on 10 August, after returning to Scapa Flow. On 13 September, after a short refit, she was sent to [[Rosyth]] along with the battleships {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} and other ships, to be in a better position to intercept a German invasion fleet. When the threat of an invasion diminished, the ship resumed her previous roles in convoy escort and patrolling against German commerce raiders. Twice, ''Hood'' was dispatched against enemy warships. On 28 October she sailed to intercept the \"pocket battleship\" {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, and again on 24 December to locate the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, but ''Hood'' failed to find either ship.\n\nIn January 1941, the ship began a refit that lasted until March; even after the refit she was still in poor condition, but the threat from the German capital ships was such that she could not be taken into dock for a major overhaul until more of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} battleships came into service. Captain [[Ralph Kerr]] assumed command during the refit, and ''Hood'' was ordered to sea in an attempt to intercept the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} upon the refit's completion in mid-March. Unsuccessful, she was ordered to patrol the [[Bay of Biscay]] against any breakout attempt by the German ships from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. ''Hood'' was ordered to the [[Norwegian Sea]] on 19 April when the Admiralty received a false report that the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}} had sailed from Germany. Afterwards, she patrolled the North Atlantic before putting into Scapa Flow on 6 May.<ref>Taylor, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Denmark Strait===\n{{Main|Battle of the Denmark Strait}}\n[[File:HOOD023.jpg|thumb|left|Last photograph of ''Hood'', seen from ''Prince of Wales''.]]\nWhen ''Bismarck'' sailed for the Atlantic in May 1941, ''Hood'', together with the newly commissioned battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}, was sent out in pursuit along with several other groups of British capital ships to intercept the German ships before they could break into the Atlantic and attack Allied convoys. ''Hood'' was commanded by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Ralph Kerr]] and was flying the flag of [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]]. The German ships were spotted by two British heavy cruisers ({{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} & {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}) on 23 May, and Holland's ships intercepted ''Bismarck'' and her consort, the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, in the [[Denmark Strait]] between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] on 24 May.<ref>Stephen, pp. 74\u201376</ref>\n\nThe British squadron spotted the Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time \u2013 the engagement commenced shortly after dawn),<ref>Kennedy, pp. 78, 108</ref> but the Germans were already aware of their presence, ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s [[hydrophone]]s having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with ''Hood'' engaging ''Prinz Eugen'', the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on ''Hood''. ''Prinz Eugen'' was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit ''Hood''{{'}}s boat deck, between her [[funnel (ship)|funnels]], and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.<ref>Taylor, pp. 218\u2013221</ref>\n\n[[File:Sinking of HMS Hood.jpg|thumb|Painting by J.C. Schmitz-Westerholt, depicting ''Hood'' sinking stern first; ''Prince of Wales'' is in the foreground]]\nJust before 06:00, while ''Hood'' was turning 20\u00b0 to port to unmask her rear turrets, she was hit again on the boat deck by one or more shells from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s fifth salvo, fired from a range of approximately {{convert|16650|m|yd}}.<ref name=j4>Jurens, et al., p. 4</ref> A shell from this salvo appears to have hit the [[spotting top]], as the boat deck was showered with body parts and debris.<ref>Taylor, p. 221</ref> A huge jet of flame burst out of ''Hood'' from the vicinity of the mainmast,<ref group=Note>According to the testimony of Captain Leach, \"...&nbsp;between one and two seconds after I formed that impression [of a hit on ''Hood''] an explosion took place in the ''Hood'' \" (Jurens, p. 131)</ref> followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship.

Despite these problems, she had hit ''Bismarck'' three times. One of these hits contaminated a good portion of the ship's fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in [[occupied France]] where she could be repaired. ''Bismarck'' was temporarily able to evade detection, [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May]].<ref>Stephen, pp. 81\u201383, 97</ref>\n\nThe official Admiralty [[communiqu\u00e9]] on the loss, broadcast on the day of the sinking, reported that: \"during the&nbsp;... action, HMS ''Hood''&nbsp;... received an unlucky hit in a [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]] and blew up.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 226</ref> The first formal board of enquiry into the loss, presided over by Vice-Admiral [[Geoffrey Blake (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Geoffrey Blake]], reported on 2 June, less than a fortnight after the loss. It endorsed this opinion, stating that:\n{{quote|(c) (The) probable cause of the loss of HMS ''Hood'' was direct penetration of the protection by one or more 15-inch shells at a range of {{convert|16500|yd|m|disp=sqbr}}, resulting in the explosion of one or more of the aft magazines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmshood.org.uk/reference/official/adm116/adm116-4351_to59.htm|title=ADM 116/4351: Report on the Loss of HMS ''Hood''|date=16 March 2007|publisher=HMS Hood Association|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nThe conduct of the inquiry became subject to criticism (e.g. from Admiral [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Tom Phillips]]), largely because no verbatim record of witnesses' testimony had been kept. Moreover, Sir Stanley V. Goodall, [[Director of Naval Construction]] came forward with an alternative theory, that the ''Hood'' had been destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. As a result, a second Board was convened under Rear Admiral Sir [[Harold Walker (Royal Navy officer)|Harold Walker]] and reported in September 1941.<ref name=h6/> This investigation was \"much more thorough than was the first, taking evidence from a total of 176 eyewitnesses to the disaster\",<ref>Jurens, p. 139</ref> and examined both Goodall's theory and others (see below). The Board came to a conclusion almost identical to that of the first board, expressed as follows:\n\n{{quote|That the sinking of ''Hood'' was due to a hit from ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15-inch shell in or adjacent to ''Hood''{{'}}s 4-inch or 15-inch magazines, causing them all to explode and wreck the after part of the ship.

The principal theories include the following causes:\n* A direct hit from a shell penetrated to a magazine aft. Such a shell could only have come from ''Bismarck'', since ''Prinz Eugen'' was no longer firing at ''Hood'' at the time of the explosion. As noted above, this version of events was almost taken for granted at the time of the sinking. Doubt first arose as a result of eyewitness testimony that the explosion that destroyed ''Hood'' originated near the mainmast, well forward of the aft magazines (for example, the sketch shown prepared for the second board of enquiry by [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Leach]] of ''Prince of Wales'').\n\nAt the second board, expert witnesses suggested that what was observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent\u2014but not instantaneous\u2014explosion or [[deflagration]] in the 4-inch shell magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.<ref>Jurens 1987, p. 139</ref>\n* A shell, falling short and travelling underwater, struck below the armoured belt and penetrated to a magazine. During the same action, ''Prince of Wales'' received a hit of this type from a 15-inch shell, which travelled underwater for about 80 feet (25 m), struck about 28 feet (8 m) below the waterline, penetrated several light bulkheads and fetched up, without exploding, against the torpedo bulkhead. The second board considered this theory improbable, arguing that the fuze, had it worked at all, would have detonated the shell before it reached the ship. According to Jurens's calculations, one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells that fell approximately {{convert|20|ft}} short of ''Hood'' could have penetrated the side of the ship beneath the armour belt and would have detonated in the vicinity of the ship's magazines if the fuze worked.<ref>Jurens 1987, pp. 147\u2013151</ref>\n* The ship was destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from ''Bismarck''. This would have blown out the side of the ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly {{convert|30|kn|km/h}}, would then shear the stern section from the rest of the hull.<ref>Jurens 1987, p. 152</ref>\n* The fire on the boat deck penetrated to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame could have been the ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through the floor of a 15-inch gunhouse.<ref>Jurens 1987, pp. 152\u2013153</ref>\n* The explosion was initiated by 4-inch ammunition stored outside the magazines. Writing in 1979, the naval historian [[Antony Preston (naval historian)|Antony Preston]] claimed that the aft magazines of ''Hood'' were \"surrounded by additional 4-inch (102 mm) anti-aircraft shells outside the armoured barbettes. Such unprotected stowage could have been detonated either by the boat-deck fire or by a shell from ''Bismarck''.\"<ref>Preston 1979, p. 109</ref>\n* The ship was blown up by her own guns. At the second board, eyewitnesses reported unusual types of discharge from the 15-inch guns of ''Hood'', suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to prevent such an explosion reaching the magazines, could have failed.<ref>Jurens 1987, p. 154</ref>\n\nAn extensive review of these theories (excepting that of Preston) is given in Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that there are several ways this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating ''Hood''{{'}}s deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14\u00b0, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of ''Hood'' show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated if ''Hood'' had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.<ref>Jurens 1987, pp. 122\u2013161</ref>\n\nA more recent development is the discovery of ''Hood''{{'}}s wreck. Inspection of the wreck has confirmed that the aft magazines did indeed explode. The stern of the ''Hood'' was located, with the rudder still in place, and it was found that this was set to port at the time of the explosion. Furthermore, a section of the bow immediately forward of 'A' turret is missing, which has led historian and former [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth]] lecturer [[Eric J. Grove]] and expedition leader [[David Mearns]] to believe that \"either just before or just after leaving the surface, the bow suffered massive internal damage from an internal explosion\",<ref name=exp>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmshood.com/hoodtoday/2001expedition/index.htm |title=The July 2001 Channel 4 Expedition to Locate and Film the Wrecks of ''Hood'' and ''Bismarck'' |publisher=HMS Hood Association |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> possibly a partial detonation of the forward 15-inch magazines.\n\nIt has been suggested that the fatal fire spread from the aft end of the ship through the starboard fuel tanks, since the starboard side of ''Hood'' \"appears to be missing most, if not all of its torpedo bulge plating\".<ref name=exp/>\n\nThe evidence of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness evidence of venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with the theory that the ''Hood'' was blown up by her own guns. The other theories listed above remain valid possibilities.<ref>Jurens et al., p. 16</ref>\n\n==Wreck==\nIn 2001, British broadcaster [[Channel 4]] commissioned shipwreck hunter [[David Mearns]] and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, to locate the wreck of ''Hood'', and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, ''Bismarck''. This was to be used for a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle.<ref name=Mearns75>Mearns, p. 75</ref> This was the first time anyone had attempted to locate ''Hood''{{'}}s resting place.<ref name=Mearns76>Mearns, p. 76</ref> Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of ''Hood'' with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS ''Hood'' Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, [[Ted Briggs]].<ref name=Mearns75/>\n\nThe search team and equipment had to be organised within four months, to take advantage of a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to [[Streaming media|stream]] video from the [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.<ref name=Mearns75/>\n\nAfter footage of ''Bismarck'' was collected, Mearns and the search team began scanning a {{convert|600|sqnmi|km2|adj=on}} search box for ''Hood''; completely covering the area was estimated to take six days. Areas that Mearns felt were more likely to hold the wreck were prioritised, and the [[side-scan sonar]] located the battlecruiser in the 39th hour of the search.<ref name=Mearns76/>\n\n''Hood''{{'}}s wreck lies on the seabed in pieces among two debris fields at a depth of about {{convert|2,800|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name=bell/> The eastern field includes the small piece of the stern that survived the magazine explosion, as well as the surviving section of the bow and some smaller remains such as the propellers. The 4-inch fire-control director lies in the western debris field. The heavily armoured conning tower is located by itself a distance from the main wreck. The amidships section, the biggest part of the wreck to survive the explosions, lies inverted south of the eastern debris field in a large impact crater. The starboard side of the amidships section is missing down to the inner wall of the fuel tanks and the plates of the hull are curling outward; this has been interpreted as indicating the path of the explosion through the starboard fuel tanks.\n\nIt is further supposed that the small debris fields are the fragments from the aft hull where the magazines and turrets were located, since that section of the hull was totally destroyed in the explosion. The fact that the bow section separated just forward of 'A' turret is suggestive that a secondary explosion might have occurred in this area.<ref>Mearns and White, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> Other researchers have claimed that the final salvo fired by ''Hood'' was not a salvo at all, but flame from the forward magazine explosion, which gave the illusion of ''Hood'' firing for the last time.<ref>Chesneau, p. 179</ref> This damage, ahead of the armoured bulkhead, could have been implosion damage suffered while ''Hood'' sank, as a torpedo room that had been removed during one of her last refits approximates the site of the break.\n\nIt was the opinion of Mearns and White who investigated the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area.<ref>Mearns and White, p. 206</ref> Bill Jurens points out that there was no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates at the edge of the break reflects only their last position, not the direction they had first moved.<ref>Jurens, et al., p. 15</ref>\n\nThe forward section lies on its port side, with the amidships section keel up. The stern section rises from the seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20\u00b0 port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' to bear on the German ships.<ref>Chesneau, p. 180</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the site was officially designated a [[war grave]] by the British government.

Commissioned in 1920, she was named after the 18th-century Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]]. One of four {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruisers|2}} ordered in mid-1916, ''Hood'' had design limitations, though her design was revised after the [[Battle of Jutland]] and improved while she was under construction. For this reason, she was the only ship of her class to be completed. Despite the appearance of new and more modern ship designs over time, ''Hood'' remained the largest warship in the world for 20 years after her commissioning, and her prestige was reflected in her nickname, \"The Mighty Hood\".\n\n''Hood'' was involved in several [[wikt:show the flag|showing-the-flag]] exercises between her commissioning in 1920 and the outbreak of war in 1939, including training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea and a circumnavigation of the globe with the [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|Special Service Squadron]] in 1923 and 1924. She was attached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] following the outbreak of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out, ''Hood'' was officially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until she had to return to Britain in 1939 for an overhaul. By this time, advances in naval gunnery had reduced ''Hood''{{'}}s usefulness. She was scheduled to undergo a major rebuild in 1941 to correct these issues, but the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 forced the ship into service without the upgrades.\n\nWhen war with Germany was declared, ''Hood'' was operating in the area around [[Iceland]], and she spent the next several months hunting for German [[commerce raider]]s and [[blockade runner]]s between Iceland and the [[Norwegian Sea]]. After a brief overhaul of her propulsion system, she sailed as the [[flagship]] of [[Force H]], and participated in the [[destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir]]. Relieved as flagship of Force H, ''Hood'' was dispatched to [[Scapa Flow]], and operated in the area as a convoy escort and later as a defence against a potential German invasion fleet. In May 1941, ''Hood'' and the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} were ordered to intercept the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, which were en route to the Atlantic, where they were to attack convoys. On 24 May 1941, early in the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], ''Hood'' was struck by several German shells, exploded, and sank within 3 minutes, with the loss of all but three of her crew. Due to her publicly perceived invincibility, the loss affected British morale.\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] conducted two inquiries into the reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that ''Hood''{{'}}s aft [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] had exploded after one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's [[torpedo]]es. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's [[gun turret]]s that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.\n\n==Design and description==\n{{Main|Admiral-class battlecruiser}}\n[[File:HMS Hood (1921) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Profile drawing of ''Hood'' as she was in 1921, in Atlantic Fleet dark grey]]\n\nThe'' Admiral''-class battlecruisers were designed in response to the German {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|2}}s, which were reported to be more heavily armed and armoured than the latest British battlecruisers of the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|5}} and the {{sclass-|Courageous|battlecruiser|4}}es. The design was revised after the Battle of Jutland to incorporate heavier armour and all four ships were laid down. Only ''Hood'' was completed, because the ships were very expensive and required labour and material that could be put to better use building merchant ships needed to replace those lost to the [[Atlantic U-boat Campaign (World War I)|German U-boat campaign]].<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\n''Hood'' was significantly larger than her predecessors of the ''Renown'' class. As completed, she had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|860|ft|7|in|1}}, a maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|104|ft|2|in|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|32|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. This was {{convert|110|ft|m|1}} longer and {{convert|14|ft|m|1}} wider than the older ships. She displaced {{convert|42670|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|46680|LT|t}} at deep load, over {{convert|13000|LT|t|-1}} more than the older ships. The ship had a complete [[double bottom]]. ''Hood'' had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|4.2|ft|1}} at deep load,<ref name=rr67>Raven and Roberts, p. 67</ref> which minimised her roll and made her a steady gun platform.\n\nThe additional armour added during construction increased her draught by about {{convert|4|ft}} at deep load, which reduced her [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and made her very wet. At full speed, or in heavy seas, water would flow over the ship's [[quarterdeck]] and often entered the [[messdeck]]s and living quarters through ventilation shafts.<ref>Taylor, pp. 92, 94</ref> This characteristic earned her the nickname of \"the largest submarine in the Navy\".<ref>Taylor, p. 92</ref> The persistent dampness, coupled with the ship's poor ventilation, was blamed for the high incidence of [[tuberculosis]] aboard.<ref>Taylor, p. 123</ref> The ship's complement varied widely over her career; in 1919, she was authorised 1433 men as a squadron flagship; in 1934, she had 81 officers and 1244 men aboard.<ref>Taylor, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe propulsion system consisted of 24 [[Yarrow boiler]]s, connected to Brown-Curtis geared [[steam turbine]]s driving four propellers. The battlecruiser's turbines were designed to produce {{convert|144000|shp|lk=in}}, which would propel the ship at {{convert|31|kn|lk=in}}, but during [[sea trial]]s in 1920, ''Hood''{{'}}s turbines provided {{convert|151280|shp|abbr=on}}, which allowed her to reach {{convert|32.07|kn}}. She carried about {{convert|3895|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 76, 79, 80</ref> which gave an estimated range of {{convert|7500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}.<ref name=\"rr67\"/>\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:HMS Hood Aft guns 1926 USNHC 57184.jpg|thumb|300px|A close-up of ''Hood''{{'}}s aft [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch Mark I guns]] in 1926.]]\n''Hood'' carried eight 42-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[British ordnance terms#BL|BL]] [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch Mk I guns]] in hydraulically powered twin [[gun turret]]s.

The turrets were designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear,<ref>Campbell, pp. 25\u201328</ref><ref>Roberts 1997, p. 89</ref> and 120 shells were carried for each gun.<ref name=\"rr67\"/>\n\n''Hood''{{'}}s secondary armament was a dozen 50-calibre [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, each with 200 rounds.<ref name=\"rr67\"/> They were shipped on [[gun shield|shielded]] single-[[pivot gun|pivot mounts]] fitted along the upper deck and the forward shelter deck. This high position allowed them to be worked during heavy weather, as they were less affected by waves and spray compared with the [[casemate]] mounts of earlier British [[capital ship]]s.<ref name=\"b97\"/> Two of these guns on the shelter deck were temporarily replaced by [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk V]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|antiaircraft]] (AA) guns between 1938 and 1939. All the 5.5-inch guns were removed during another refit in 1940.<ref name=\"secondaryguns\" /> The gun fired an {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell to a maximum range of {{convert|17770|yd}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe original antiaircraft armament consisted of four QF 4-inch Mk V guns on single mounts. These were joined in early 1939 by four twin mounts for the 45-calibre [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark XVI]] [[dual-purpose gun]]. The single guns were removed in mid-1939 and a further three twin Mark XIX mounts were added in early 1940.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 193, 195</ref> This mounting could elevate from \u221210 to +80\u00b0. The Mk XVI gun fired about twelve {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[British ordnance terms#HE|high-explosive]] shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets, it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|39000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref>\n\nIn 1931, a pair of octuple mountings for the {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|1}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun]] were added on the shelter deck, abreast of the funnels, and a third mount was added in 1937.<ref name=rr95>Raven and Roberts, p. 195</ref> These gun mounts could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of +80\u00b0.

The gun's rate of fire was around 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nTwo quadruple mountings for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers {{convert|0.5|in|1|adj=on}} Mk III]] machine gun were added in 1933 with two more mountings added in 1937.<ref name=rr95/> These mounts could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of +70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range around {{convert|5000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> To these were added five [[unrotated projectile]] launchers in 1940, each launcher carrying 20 {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} rockets.<ref name=rr95/> When they detonated, the rockets shot out lengths of cable that were kept aloft by [[parachute]]s; the cable was intended to snag aircraft and draw up the small aerial mine that would destroy the aircraft.<ref>Campbell, p. 100</ref>\n\nSix fixed {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted on ''Hood'', three on each [[broadside]]. Two of these were submerged forward of 'A' turret's [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and the other four were above water, [[wikt:abaft|abaft]] the rear funnel.<ref name=\"rr67\"/> The [[British 21 inch torpedo|Mk IV torpedoes]] had a warhead of {{convert|515|lb}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. They had two speed and range settings \u2013 {{convert|25|kn}} with a maximum range of {{convert|13500|yd}} or {{convert|40|kn}} to {{convert|5000|yd}}.

Behind the turret is the conning tower surmounted by the main fire-control director with its own rangefinder. The secondary director is mounted on top of the spotting top on the tripod foremast.]]\n\n''Hood'' was completed with two [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control directors]]. One was mounted above the [[conning tower]], protected by an armoured hood, and was fitted with a {{convert|30|ft|1|adj=on}} [[rangefinder]]. The other was fitted in the [[Top (sailing ship)|spotting top]] above the tripod [[foremast]] and equipped with a {{convert|15|ft|1|adj=on}} rangefinder. Each turret was also fitted with a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinder. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. They were supplemented by two additional control positions in the fore-top, which were provided with {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on|1}} rangefinders, fitted in 1924\u201325.<ref name=b97>Burt, p. 297</ref> The antiaircraft guns were controlled by a simple high-angle {{convert|2|m|ftin|adj=on}} rangefinder mounted on the aft control position,<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 68</ref> fitted in 1926\u20131927. Three torpedo-control towers were fitted, each with a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinder. One was on each side of the amidships control tower and the third was on the centreline abaft the aft control position.<ref name=b97/>\n\nDuring the 1929\u201331 refit, a [[HACS|high-angle control system]] (HACS) Mark I director was added on the rear searchlight platform and two positions for 2-pounder \"pom-pom\" antiaircraft directors were added at the rear of the spotting top, although only one director was initially fitted.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 189</ref> The 5.5-inch control positions and their rangefinders on the spotting top were removed during the 1932 refit. In 1934, the \"pom-pom\" directors were moved to the former locations of the 5.5-inch control positions on the spotting top and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} rangefinders for the 5.5-inch control positions were reinstalled on the signal platform. Two years later, the \"pom-pom\" directors were moved to the rear corners of the bridge to get them out of the funnel gases. Another \"pom-pom\" director was added on the rear superstructure, abaft the HACS director in 1938. Two HACS Mark III directors were added to the aft end of the signal platform the following year, and the Mark I director aft was replaced by a Mark III.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 189\u2013195</ref> During ''Hood''{{'}}s last refit in 1941, a [[Type 279 radar|Type 279]] air warning radar and a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 284|Type 284]] gunnery radar were installed,<ref>Burt, p. 308</ref> although the Type 279 radar lacked its receiving aerial and was inoperable according to Roberts.<ref name=r1/>\n\nHowever, Admiralty document ADM 220/76 \"Reports of performance in H.M.S. Hood, H.M.S. Illustrious, H.M.S. King George V and smaller vessels of RDF279\"<ref>http://www.hmshood.org.uk/reference/official/adm220/adm220-76.htm</ref> indicates that, following the 1941 refit at Rosyth, ''Hood''{{'}}s Type 279 radar was indeed functional. According to the HMS ''Hood'' Association website,<ref>http://www.hmshood.com/ship/radar.htm</ref> the air warning radar was of a modified type, known as Type 279M, the difference between this and Type 279 being the number of aerials. While Type 279 used two aerials, a transmitter and a receiver, the Type 279M used only a single transceiver aerial. ''Hood'' reported an accuracy of 3 degrees with her 279M set.\n\n===Protection===\n''Hood''{{'}}s armour scheme was originally based on that of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}} with an {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} [[Belt armor|waterline belt]]. Unlike on ''Tiger'', the armour was angled outwards 12\u00b0 from the waterline to increase its relative thickness in relation to flat-trajectory shells. This change increased the ship's vulnerability to [[plunging fire|plunging]] (high-trajectory) shells, as it exposed more of the vulnerable deck armour. {{convert|5000|LT|t}} of armour were added to the design in late 1916, based on British experiences at the [[Battle of Jutland]], at the cost of deeper draught and slightly decreased speed.\n\nTo save construction time, this was accomplished by thickening the existing armour, rather than redesigning the entire ship.<ref>Burt, pp. 297\u2013298</ref> ''Hood''{{'}}s protection accounted for 33% of her displacement, a high proportion by British standards, but less than was usual in contemporary German designs (for example, 36% for the battlecruiser {{SMS|Hindenburg}}).<ref>Friedman, pp. 168\u2013169, 171\u2013172</ref>\n\nThe armoured belt consisted of face-hardened [[Krupp cemented armour]] (KC), arranged in three [[strake]]s. The main waterline belt was 12&nbsp;inches (305&nbsp;mm) thick between 'A' and 'Y' [[barbette]]s and thinned to 5 to 6&nbsp;inches (127 to 152&nbsp;mm) towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The middle armour belt had a maximum thickness of 7&nbsp;inches (178&nbsp;mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5&nbsp;inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102&nbsp;mm) extension aft.<ref>Roberts 1997, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe gun turrets and barbettes were protected by {{convert|11|to|15|in|mm|0}} of KC armour, except for the turret roofs, which were 5 inches thick. The decks were made of high-tensile steel. The [[forecastle]] deck ranged from 1.75 to 2.0&nbsp;inches (44 to 51&nbsp;mm) in thickness, while the upper deck was 2&nbsp;inches (51&nbsp;mm) thick over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and 0.75&nbsp;inches (19&nbsp;mm) elsewhere. The main deck was 3&nbsp;inches (76&nbsp;mm) thick over the magazines and 1&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm) elsewhere, except for the 2-inch-thick slope that met the bottom of the main belt. The lower deck was 3&nbsp;inches thick over the [[propeller shaft]]s, 2&nbsp;inches thick over the magazines and 1&nbsp;inch elsewhere.<ref name=b99>Burt, p. 299</ref>\n\nThe 3-inch plating on the main deck was added at a very late stage of construction and the four aftermost 5.5-inch guns and their ammunition hoists were removed in partial compensation. Live-firing trials with the new 15-inch APC (armour-piercing, capped) shell against a mock-up of ''Hood'' showed that this shell could penetrate the ship's vitals via the 7-inch middle belt and the 2-inch slope of the main deck. A proposal was made to increase the armour over the forward magazines to 5&nbsp;inches and 6&nbsp;inches over the rear magazines in July 1919 in response to these trials. To compensate for the additional weight, the two submerged torpedo tubes and the armour for the rear torpedo warheads were removed, and the armour for the aft torpedo-control tower was reduced in thickness from 6 to {{convert|1.5|in}}. However, the additional armour was never fitted pending further trials.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 68\u201369</ref> As completed, ''Hood'' remained susceptible to plunging shells and bombs.<ref name=b99/> The torpedo warhead armour was reinstated during the ship's 1929\u20131931 refit.<ref name=r1>Roberts 2001, p. 21</ref>\n\nFor protection against torpedoes, she was given a {{convert|7.5|ft|1|adj=on}}<ref name=b99/> deep [[torpedo bulge]] that ran the length of the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into an empty outer compartment and an inner compartment filled with five rows of water-tight \"crushing tubes\" intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The bulge was backed by a 1.5-inch-thick [[torpedo bulkhead]].<ref>Roberts 1997, p. 111</ref>\n\n===Aircraft===\n''Hood'' was initially fitted with flying-off platforms mounted on top of 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which [[Fairey Flycatcher]]s could launch.<ref>Taylor, p. 78</ref> During her 1929\u201331 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] was installed on her [[quarterdeck]], along with a crane to recover a [[seaplane]]. She embarked a [[Fairey III]]F from No. 444 Flight of the [[Royal Air Force]]. During the 1932 [[West Indies]] cruise, the catapult proved to be difficult to operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 189\u2013191</ref>\n\n===Battlecruiser or fast battleship===\nAlthough the Royal Navy always designated ''Hood'' as a battlecruiser, some modern writers such as [[Anthony Preston (naval historian)|Anthony Preston]] have classified her as a [[fast battleship]], since ''Hood'' appeared to have improvements over the fast {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s. On paper, ''Hood'' retained the same armament and level of protection, while being significantly faster.<ref name=\"hmshood.com\"/><ref>Preston 2002, p. 96</ref>\n\nAround 1918, American commanders, including Vice Admiral [[William Sims]], commander of US naval forces in Europe, and Admiral [[Henry T. Mayo]], commander of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], became extremely impressed by ''Hood'', which they described as a \"fast battleship\", and they advocated that the US Navy develop a fast battleship of its own.<ref>Hone, p. 23</ref> However, the US continued with their established design direction, the slower, but well-protected {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|0}} battleship and the fast and lightly armoured {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|2}}, both of which were later cancelled in accordance with the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 76</ref>\n\nInfluences from ''Hood'' showed on subsequent ''Lexington'' designs, with the reduction of the main armour belt, the change to \"[[sloped armour]]\", and the addition of four above-water torpedo tubes to the four underwater tubes of the original design.<ref>Morison and Polmar, pp. 71\u201372</ref> To add to the confusion, Royal Navy documents of the period often describe any battleship with a maximum speed over {{convert|24|kn}} as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour. For instance, the never-built [[G3 battlecruiser]] was classified as such, although it would have been more of a fast battleship than ''Hood''.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 90</ref>\n\nThe scale of ''Hood''{{'}}s protection, though adequate for the Jutland era, was at best marginal against the new generation of {{convert|16|in|mm|0|adj=on}} gunned capital ships that emerged soon after her completion in 1920, typified by the American {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|0}} and the Japanese {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|2}}s. The Royal Navy were fully aware that the ship's protection flaws still remained, even in her revised design, so ''Hood'' was intended for the duties of a battlecruiser and she served in the battlecruiser squadrons through most of her career. Late in her career, ''Hood'' was outclassed by the armour and protective arrangement of World War II-era fast battleships, but few available \"big gun\" vessels could match ''Bismarck''{{'}}s speed, and in 1941, the Admiralty included ''Hood'' among the ships sent to engage the German battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''.<ref name=\"hmshood.com\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nConstruction of ''Hood'' began at the [[John Brown & Company]] shipyards in [[Clydebank]], Scotland, on 1 September 1916. Following the loss of three British battlecruisers at the Battle of Jutland, 5,000&nbsp;tons of extra armour and bracing were added to ''Hood''{{'}}s design.<ref>Burt, p. 298</ref> Most seriously, the deck protection was flawed\u2014spread over three decks, it was designed to detonate an incoming shell on impact with the top deck, with much of the energy being absorbed as the exploding shell had to penetrate the armour of the next two decks. The development of effective time-delay shells at the end of [[World War I]] made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship.<ref>Brown, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.<ref name=\"hmshood.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmshood.com/history/construct/design.htm|title=Designing HMS ''Hood''|date=30 November 2008|publisher=HMS Hood Association|accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nShe was launched on 22 August 1918 by the widow of Rear Admiral Sir [[Horace Hood]], a great-great-grandson of Admiral Samuel Hood, after whom the ship was named. Sir Horace Hood had been killed while commanding the [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] and flying his flag on {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}}\u2014one of the three battlecruisers which blew up at the Battle of Jutland. To make room in John Brown's shipyard for merchant construction, ''Hood'' sailed for [[Rosyth]] to complete her [[fitting-out]] on 9 January 1920.<ref>Taylor, pp. 15, 19</ref> After [[sea trial]]s, she was commissioned on 15 May 1920, under [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Wilfred Tompkinson. She had cost [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]6,025,000 to build.<ref>Parkes, p. 644</ref>\n\nWith her conspicuous twin funnels and lean profile, ''Hood'' was widely regarded one of the finest-looking warships ever built. She was also the largest warship afloat when she was commissioned, and retained that distinction for the next 20 years.<ref>Burt, pp. 295, 303</ref> Her size and powerful armament earned her the nickname of \"Mighty Hood\" and she came to symbolise the might of the British Empire itself.<ref>Taylor, p. 20</ref>\n\n==Interwar service==\n[[File:HMS Hood in Sydney Harbour.jpeg|thumb|HMS ''Hood'' in [[Sydney Harbour]] shortly after arriving with the other ships of the [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|Special Service Squadron]] during their world tour, on 9 April 1924]]\n\nShortly after commissioning on 15 May 1920, ''Hood'' became the flagship of the [[Battlecruiser Squadron]] of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] Sir [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]]. After a cruise to Scandinavian waters that year, Captain Geoffrey Mackworth assumed command. ''Hood'' visited the [[Mediterranean]] in 1921 and 1922 to show the flag and to train with the Mediterranean fleet, before sailing on a cruise to Brazil and the West Indies in company with the battlecruiser squadron.<ref>Taylor, pp. 234\u2013235</ref>\n\nCaptain [[John Knowles Im Thurn|John im Thurn]] was in command when ''Hood'', accompanied by the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} and {{sclass-|Danae|cruiser|2}}s of the [[1st Light Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Light Cruiser Squadron]], set out [[Cruise of the Special Service Squadron|on a world cruise]] from west to east via the [[Panama Canal]] in November 1923. The objective of the cruise was to remind the [[dominion]]s of their dependence on British sea power and encourage them to support it with money, ships, and facilities. They returned home 10 months later in September 1924, having visited [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British India|India]], Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and some smaller colonies and dependencies, and the United States.<ref>Taylor, pp. 70, 236</ref>\n\nWhile in Australia in April 1924, the squadron escorted the battlecruiser {{HMAS|Australia|1911|6}} out to sea, where she was [[scuttled]] in compliance with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].<ref>Bastock, p. 38</ref> The battlecruiser squadron visited [[Lisbon]] in January 1925 to participate in the [[Vasco da Gama]] celebrations before continuing on to the Mediterranean for exercises. ''Hood'' continued this pattern of a winter training visit to the Mediterranean for the rest of the decade. Captain Harold Reinold relieved Captain im Thurn on 30 April 1925 and was relieved in turn by Captain [[Wilfred French]] on 21 May 1927.<ref>Taylor, pp. 236\u2013238</ref>\n\n''Hood'' was given a major refit from 1 May 1929 to 10 March 1931, and afterwards resumed her role as flagship of the battlecruiser squadron under the command of Captain [[Julian Patterson]]. Later that year, her crew participated in the [[Invergordon Mutiny]] over pay cuts for the sailors. It ended peacefully and ''Hood'' returned to her home port afterwards. The battlecruiser squadron made a Caribbean cruise in early 1932, and ''Hood'' was given another brief refit between 31 March and 10 May at [[Portsmouth]]. Captain Thomas Binney assumed command on 15 August 1932 and the ship resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in the Mediterranean the next year. Captain Thomas Tower replaced Captain Binney on 30 August 1933. Her secondary and antiaircraft fire-control directors were rearranged during another quick refit between 1 August and 5 September 1934.<ref>Taylor, pp. 237\u2013238</ref>\n\nWhile en route to [[Gibraltar]] for a Mediterranean cruise, ''Hood'' was rammed in the port side [[quarterdeck]] by the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} on 23 January 1935. The damage to ''Hood'' was limited to her left outer propeller and an 18-inch (460&nbsp;mm) dent, although some hull plates were knocked loose from the impact. Temporary repairs were made at Gibraltar before the ship sailed to Portsmouth for permanent repairs between February and May 1935. The captains of both ships were [[court-martial]]led, as was the squadron commander, Rear Admiral Sidney Bailey. Tower and Bailey were acquitted, but ''Renown''{{'}}s Captain Sawbridge was relieved of command. The Admiralty dissented from the verdict, reinstated Sawbridge, and criticised Bailey for ambiguous signals during the manoeuvre.<ref>Taylor, pp. 165\u2013166, 167</ref>\n\nThe ship participated in [[King George V]]'s Silver Jubilee [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] the following August. She was attached to the Mediterranean fleet shortly afterwards and stationed at Gibraltar at the outbreak of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] in October. Captain [[Arthur Pridham]] assumed command on 1 February 1936 and ''Hood'' returned to Portsmouth for a brief refit between 26 June and 10 October 1936. She formally transferred to the Mediterranean fleet on 20 October, shortly after the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>Burt, pp. 309\u2013310</ref> On 23 April 1937, the ship escorted three British merchantmen into [[Bilbao]] harbour despite the presence of the [[Spanish State|Nationalist]] cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Almirante Cervera||2}} that attempted to blockade the port.<ref>Taylor, pp. 172\u2013173, 238\u2013240</ref> ''Hood'' was refitted at Malta in November and December 1937, and had her submerged torpedo tubes removed.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 191</ref> Captain Pridham was relieved by Captain Harold Walker on 20 May 1938 and he, in turn, was relieved when the ship returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August.<ref>Taylor, p. 240</ref>\n\n''Hood'' was due to be modernised in 1941 to bring her up to a standard similar to that of other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin [[QF 5.25-inch naval gun|5.25-inch gun turrets]], and six octuple [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2-pounder pom-poms]]. Her 5-inch upper-armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition, the conning tower would have been removed and her [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] rebuilt.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 195\u2013197</ref> The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast [[capital ship]], meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s, she was in need of a lengthy overhaul. The outbreak of World War II made removing her from service near impossible, and as a consequence, she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} and several of the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 197</ref> The ship's condensers were in such bad condition by this time that much of the output from the fresh-water evaporators was required to replenish the boiler feed water and could not be used by the crew to wash and bathe or even to heat the mess decks during cold weather, as the steam pipes were too leaky. These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.<ref>Taylor, p. 39</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nCaptain [[Irvine Glennie]] assumed command in May 1939 and ''Hood'' was assigned to the Home Fleet's Battlecruiser Squadron while still refitting. When war broke out later that year, she was employed principally to patrol in the vicinity of [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] to protect convoys and intercept German [[merchant raider]]s and [[blockade runner]]s attempting to break out into the Atlantic. On 25 September 1939, the Home Fleet sortied into the central [[North Sea]] to cover the return of the damaged submarine {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|2}}. The fleet was spotted by the Germans and attacked by aircraft from the [[Kampfgeschwader 26|KG 26]] and [[Kampfgeschwader 30|KG 30]] bomber wings. ''Hood'' was hit by a 250&nbsp;kg (550&nbsp;lb) bomb from a [[Junkers Ju 88]] [[bomber]] that damaged her port torpedo bulge and her condensers. By early 1940, ''Hood''{{'}}s machinery was in dire shape and limited her best speed to {{convert|26.5|kn}}; she was refitted between 4 April and 12 June.<ref>Taylor, pp. 192, 240\u2013241</ref>\n\n===Operation Catapult===\n''Hood'' and the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} were ordered to Gibraltar to join [[Force H]] on 18 June where ''Hood'' became the flagship. Force H took part in the [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|destruction of the French fleet at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] in July 1940. Just eight days after the French surrender, the British Admiralty issued an ultimatum that the French fleet at [[Oran]] intern its ships in a British or neutral port to ensure they would not fall into [[Axis powers|Axis]] hands. The terms were rejected and the Royal Navy opened fire on the French ships berthed there. The results of ''Hood''{{'}}s fire are not known exactly, but she damaged the {{ship|French battleship|Dunkerque}}, which was hit by four fifteen-inch shells and was forced to beach herself. ''Hood'' was [[wikt:straddle|straddled]] during the engagement by ''Dunkerque''; shell splinters wounded two men. ''Dunkerque''{{'}}s [[sister ship]], {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg||2}}, managed to escape from the harbour. ''Hood'' and several light cruisers gave chase, but gave up after two hours: ''Hood'' had dodged a salvo of torpedoes from a French [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] and had stripped a turbine reaching {{convert|28|kn}}.<ref>Taylor, pp. 202\u2013203</ref>\n\n===Return to home waters===\n''Hood'' was relieved as flagship of Force H by ''Renown'' on 10 August, after returning to Scapa Flow. On 13 September, after a short refit, she was sent to [[Rosyth]] along with the battleships {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} and other ships, to be in a better position to intercept a German invasion fleet. When the threat of an invasion diminished, the ship resumed her previous roles in convoy escort and patrolling against German commerce raiders. Twice, ''Hood'' was dispatched against enemy warships. On 28 October she sailed to intercept the \"pocket battleship\" {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, and again on 24 December to locate the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, but ''Hood'' failed to find either ship.\n\nIn January 1941, the ship began a refit that lasted until March; even after the refit she was still in poor condition, but the threat from the German capital ships was such that she could not be taken into dock for a major overhaul until more of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} battleships came into service. Captain [[Ralph Kerr]] assumed command during the refit, and ''Hood'' was ordered to sea in an attempt to intercept the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} upon the refit's completion in mid-March. Unsuccessful, she was ordered to patrol the [[Bay of Biscay]] against any breakout attempt by the German ships from [[Brest, France|Brest]]. ''Hood'' was ordered to the [[Norwegian Sea]] on 19 April when the Admiralty received a false report that the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck}} had sailed from Germany. Afterwards, she patrolled the North Atlantic before putting into Scapa Flow on 6 May.<ref>Taylor, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Denmark Strait===\n{{Main|Battle of the Denmark Strait}}\n[[File:HOOD023.jpg|thumb|left|Last photograph of ''Hood'', seen from ''Prince of Wales''.]]\nWhen ''Bismarck'' sailed for the Atlantic in May 1941, ''Hood'', together with the newly commissioned battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}}, was sent out in pursuit along with several other groups of British capital ships to intercept the German ships before they could break into the Atlantic and attack Allied convoys. ''Hood'' was commanded by [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Ralph Kerr]] and was flying the flag of [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]]. The German ships were spotted by two British heavy cruisers ({{HMS|Norfolk|78|2}} & {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}) on 23 May, and Holland's ships intercepted ''Bismarck'' and her consort, the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, in the [[Denmark Strait]] between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]] on 24 May.<ref>Stephen, pp. 74\u201376</ref>\n\nThe British squadron spotted the Germans at 05:37 (ship's clocks were set four hours ahead of local time \u2013 the engagement commenced shortly after dawn),<ref>Kennedy, pp. 78, 108</ref> but the Germans were already aware of their presence, ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s [[hydrophone]]s having previously detected the sounds of high-speed propellers to their southeast. The British opened fire at 05:52 with ''Hood'' engaging ''Prinz Eugen'', the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire at 05:55, both ships concentrating on ''Hood''. ''Prinz Eugen'' was probably the first ship to score when a shell hit ''Hood''{{'}}s boat deck, between her [[funnel (ship)|funnels]], and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the UP mounts.<ref>Taylor, pp. 218\u2013221</ref>\n\n[[File:Sinking of HMS Hood.jpg|thumb|Painting by J.C.

Despite these problems, she had hit ''Bismarck'' three times. One of these hits contaminated a good portion of the ship's fuel supply and subsequently caused her to steer for safety in [[occupied France]] where she could be repaired. ''Bismarck'' was temporarily able to evade detection, [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May]].<ref>Stephen, pp. 81\u201383, 97</ref>\n\nThe official Admiralty [[communiqu\u00e9]] on the loss, broadcast on the day of the sinking, reported that: \"during the&nbsp;... action, HMS ''Hood''&nbsp;... received an unlucky hit in a [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]] and blew up.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 226</ref> The first formal board of enquiry into the loss, presided over by Vice-Admiral [[Geoffrey Blake (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Geoffrey Blake]], reported on 2 June, less than a fortnight after the loss. It endorsed this opinion, stating that:\n{{quote|(c) (The) probable cause of the loss of HMS ''Hood'' was direct penetration of the protection by one or more 15-inch shells at a range of {{convert|16500|yd|m|disp=sqbr}}, resulting in the explosion of one or more of the aft magazines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmshood.org.uk/reference/official/adm116/adm116-4351_to59.htm|title=ADM 116/4351: Report on the Loss of HMS ''Hood''|date=16 March 2007|publisher=HMS Hood Association|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>}}\n\nThe conduct of the inquiry became subject to criticism (e.g. from Admiral [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Tom Phillips]]), largely because no verbatim record of witnesses' testimony had been kept. Moreover, Sir Stanley V. Goodall, [[Director of Naval Construction]] came forward with an alternative theory, that the ''Hood'' had been destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. As a result, a second Board was convened under Rear Admiral Sir [[Harold Walker (Royal Navy officer)|Harold Walker]] and reported in September 1941.<ref name=h6/> This investigation was \"much more thorough than was the first, taking evidence from a total of 176 eyewitnesses to the disaster\",<ref>Jurens, p. 139</ref> and examined both Goodall's theory and others (see below).

The principal theories include the following causes:\n* A direct hit from a shell penetrated to a magazine aft. Such a shell could only have come from ''Bismarck'', since ''Prinz Eugen'' was no longer firing at ''Hood'' at the time of the explosion. As noted above, this version of events was almost taken for granted at the time of the sinking. Doubt first arose as a result of eyewitness testimony that the explosion that destroyed ''Hood'' originated near the mainmast, well forward of the aft magazines (for example, the sketch shown prepared for the second board of enquiry by [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Leach]] of ''Prince of Wales'').\n\nAt the second board, expert witnesses suggested that what was observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent\u2014but not instantaneous\u2014explosion or [[deflagration]] in the 4-inch shell magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.<ref>Jurens 1987, p. 139</ref>\n* A shell, falling short and travelling underwater, struck below the armoured belt and penetrated to a magazine. During the same action, ''Prince of Wales'' received a hit of this type from a 15-inch shell, which travelled underwater for about 80 feet (25 m), struck about 28 feet (8 m) below the waterline, penetrated several light bulkheads and fetched up, without exploding, against the torpedo bulkhead. The second board considered this theory improbable, arguing that the fuze, had it worked at all, would have detonated the shell before it reached the ship. According to Jurens's calculations, one of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells that fell approximately {{convert|20|ft}} short of ''Hood'' could have penetrated the side of the ship beneath the armour belt and would have detonated in the vicinity of the ship's magazines if the fuze worked.<ref>Jurens 1987, pp. 147\u2013151</ref>\n* The ship was destroyed by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from ''Bismarck''. This would have blown out the side of the ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, at a speed of nearly {{convert|30|kn|km/h}}, would then shear the stern section from the rest of the hull.<ref>Jurens 1987, p. 152</ref>\n* The fire on the boat deck penetrated to a magazine. Evidence given to the second board indicated that the doors for the 4-inch ammunition supply trunks were closed throughout the action. It remains possible that a door or trunk could have been opened up by an enemy shell, admitting flames to the magazine. Alternative routes for admission of flame could have been the ventilation or venting arrangements of the magazines or, as Ted Briggs suggested, through the floor of a 15-inch gunhouse.<ref>Jurens 1987, pp. 152\u2013153</ref>\n* The explosion was initiated by 4-inch ammunition stored outside the magazines. Writing in 1979, the naval historian [[Antony Preston (naval historian)|Antony Preston]] claimed that the aft magazines of ''Hood'' were \"surrounded by additional 4-inch (102 mm) anti-aircraft shells outside the armoured barbettes. Such unprotected stowage could have been detonated either by the boat-deck fire or by a shell from ''Bismarck''.\"<ref>Preston 1979, p. 109</ref>\n* The ship was blown up by her own guns. At the second board, eyewitnesses reported unusual types of discharge from the 15-inch guns of ''Hood'', suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to prevent such an explosion reaching the magazines, could have failed.<ref>Jurens 1987, p. 154</ref>\n\nAn extensive review of these theories (excepting that of Preston) is given in Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that there are several ways this could have been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating ''Hood''{{'}}s deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14\u00b0, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of ''Hood'' show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated if ''Hood'' had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.<ref>Jurens 1987, pp. 122\u2013161</ref>\n\nA more recent development is the discovery of ''Hood''{{'}}s wreck. Inspection of the wreck has confirmed that the aft magazines did indeed explode. The stern of the ''Hood'' was located, with the rudder still in place, and it was found that this was set to port at the time of the explosion. Furthermore, a section of the bow immediately forward of 'A' turret is missing, which has led historian and former [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth]] lecturer [[Eric J. Grove]] and expedition leader [[David Mearns]] to believe that \"either just before or just after leaving the surface, the bow suffered massive internal damage from an internal explosion\",<ref name=exp>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmshood.com/hoodtoday/2001expedition/index.htm |title=The July 2001 Channel 4 Expedition to Locate and Film the Wrecks of ''Hood'' and ''Bismarck'' |publisher=HMS Hood Association |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> possibly a partial detonation of the forward 15-inch magazines.\n\nIt has been suggested that the fatal fire spread from the aft end of the ship through the starboard fuel tanks, since the starboard side of ''Hood'' \"appears to be missing most, if not all of its torpedo bulge plating\".<ref name=exp/>\n\nThe evidence of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness evidence of venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with the theory that the ''Hood'' was blown up by her own guns. The other theories listed above remain valid possibilities.<ref>Jurens et al., p. 16</ref>\n\n==Wreck==\nIn 2001, British broadcaster [[Channel 4]] commissioned shipwreck hunter [[David Mearns]] and his company, Blue Water Recoveries, to locate the wreck of ''Hood'', and if possible, produce underwater footage of both the battlecruiser and her attacker, ''Bismarck''. This was to be used for a major event documentary to be aired on the 60th anniversary of the ships' battle.<ref name=Mearns75>Mearns, p. 75</ref> This was the first time anyone had attempted to locate ''Hood''{{'}}s resting place.<ref name=Mearns76>Mearns, p. 76</ref> Mearns had spent the previous six years privately researching the fate of ''Hood'' with the goal of finding the battlecruiser, and had acquired the support of the Royal Navy, the HMS ''Hood'' Association and other veterans groups, and the last living survivor, [[Ted Briggs]].<ref name=Mearns75/>\n\nThe search team and equipment had to be organised within four months, to take advantage of a narrow window of calm conditions in the North Atlantic. Organisation of the search was complicated by the presence on board of a documentary team and their film equipment, along with a television journalist who made live news reports via satellite during the search. The search team also planned to [[Streaming media|stream]] video from the [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) directly to Channel 4's website.<ref name=Mearns75/>\n\nAfter footage of ''Bismarck'' was collected, Mearns and the search team began scanning a {{convert|600|sqnmi|km2|adj=on}} search box for ''Hood''; completely covering the area was estimated to take six days. Areas that Mearns felt were more likely to hold the wreck were prioritised, and the [[side-scan sonar]] located the battlecruiser in the 39th hour of the search.<ref name=Mearns76/>\n\n''Hood''{{'}}s wreck lies on the seabed in pieces among two debris fields at a depth of about {{convert|2,800|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name=bell/> The eastern field includes the small piece of the stern that survived the magazine explosion, as well as the surviving section of the bow and some smaller remains such as the propellers. The 4-inch fire-control director lies in the western debris field. The heavily armoured conning tower is located by itself a distance from the main wreck. The amidships section, the biggest part of the wreck to survive the explosions, lies inverted south of the eastern debris field in a large impact crater. The starboard side of the amidships section is missing down to the inner wall of the fuel tanks and the plates of the hull are curling outward; this has been interpreted as indicating the path of the explosion through the starboard fuel tanks.\n\nIt is further supposed that the small debris fields are the fragments from the aft hull where the magazines and turrets were located, since that section of the hull was totally destroyed in the explosion. The fact that the bow section separated just forward of 'A' turret is suggestive that a secondary explosion might have occurred in this area.<ref>Mearns and White, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> Other researchers have claimed that the final salvo fired by ''Hood'' was not a salvo at all, but flame from the forward magazine explosion, which gave the illusion of ''Hood'' firing for the last time.<ref>Chesneau, p. 179</ref> This damage, ahead of the armoured bulkhead, could have been implosion damage suffered while ''Hood'' sank, as a torpedo room that had been removed during one of her last refits approximates the site of the break.\n\nIt was the opinion of Mearns and White who investigated the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area.<ref>Mearns and White, p. 206</ref> Bill Jurens points out that there was no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the vertical position by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates at the edge of the break reflects only their last position, not the direction they had first moved.<ref>Jurens, et al., p. 15</ref>\n\nThe forward section lies on its port side, with the amidships section keel up. The stern section rises from the seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20\u00b0 port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' to bear on the German ships.<ref>Chesneau, p. 180</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the site was officially designated a [[war grave]] by the British government. As such, it remains a protected place under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act]] of 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20062616.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 2006 No. 2616 The Protection of Military Remains Act of 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2006 |publisher=Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament |accessdate=20 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708214655/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20062616.htm |archivedate=8 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Expeditions to retrieve ship's bell===\nIn 2012, the British Government gave permission for Mearns to return to the site of ''Hood''{{'}}s final resting place to retrieve one of her two ship's bells which were lying in a small open debris field some way from the wreck herself.
