Serra's [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa|original mission]] was named after the 13th-century saint and bishop [[Louis of Toulouse]]. The city, locally referred to as ''San Luis,'' ''SLO,'' or ''SLO Town'' (as its county is also referred to as ''SLO'') is the [[county seat]] of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]] and is adjacent to [[California Polytechnic State University]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American===\nThe earliest human inhabitants of the local area were the [[Chumash people]]. One of the earliest villages lies south of San Luis Obispo and reflects the landscape of the early [[Holocene]] when estuaries came farther inland. The Chumash people used marine resources of the inlets and bays along the Central Coast and inhabited a network of villages, including sites at [[Los Osos, California|Los Osos]] and [[Morro Creek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 |title=The Megalithic Portal |publisher=Mwegalithic.co.uk |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> The tribal site on present-day San Luis Obispo was named ''ti\u0142hini'', [[Obispe\u00f1o language|Obispe\u00f1o]] for \"Place of the full moon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/ytt |title=yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u resources - University Housing - Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo |publisher=Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo University Housing |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n===Mission period===\nDuring the [[Spanish Empire]] expansion throughout the world, specifically in 1769, Franciscan [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] received orders from Spain to bring the Catholic faith to the natives of [[Alta California]]; the idea was to unify the empire under the same religion and language. [[Mission San Diego]] was the first [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish mission]] founded in Alta California that same year.\n\nOn September 7, 1769, an expedition led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]] entered the San Luis Obispo area from coastal areas around today's [[Pismo Beach, California|Pismo Beach]]. One of the expedition's three diarists, padre [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]], recorded the name given to this area by the soldiers as ''Ca\u00f1ada de Los Osos'' (\"ca\u00f1ada\" translates as \"valley\" or \"canyon\"). The party traveled north along San Luis Obispo Creek, turned west through Los Osos Valley, and reached [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] on September 9.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=184\u2013187 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |location= |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2019-12-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1770, Portola established the [[Presidio of Monterey]] and Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the second mission, [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo|San Carlos Borromeo]], in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. The mission was moved to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the following year. As supplies dwindled in 1772 at the mission and Presidio, the people faced starvation. Remembering the Valley of the Bears, [[Presidio of Monterey]] commander [[Pedro Fages]] (a member of the [[Portol\u00e0 expedition]]) led a hunting expedition to bring back food. Over twenty-five mule loads of dried bear meat and seed were sent north to relieve the missionaries, soldiers, and neophytes (baptized natives). The natives were impressed at the ease by which the Spaniards could take down the huge grizzlies with their weapons. Some of the bear meat was traded with the local people in exchange for edible seed. It was after this that Jun\u00edpero Serra decided that La Ca\u00f1ada de Los Osos would be an ideal place for the fifth mission.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe area had abundant supplies of food and water, the climate was also very mild, and the local [[Chumash people|Chumash]] were very friendly. With soldiers, muleteers, and pack animals carrying mission supplies, Jun\u00edpero Serra set out from Carmel to reach the Valley of the Bears. On September 1, 1772, Jun\u00edpero Serra celebrated the first Mass with a cross erected near San Luis Creek. The very next day, he departed for San Diego leaving Fr. Jos\u00e9 Cavaller, with the difficult task of building the mission. Fr. [[Jos\u00e9 Cavaller]], five soldiers and two neophytes began building [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]] ({{langnf||Spanish|\"[[Louis of Toulouse|St. Louis]] Bishop of Toulouse\"}}) which would later become the town of San Luis Obispo.\n\nThe first mission structures were built with whatever materials could be found nearby. Later, more permanent buildings were constructed with [[adobe]] walls, wood timber roof beams and tile roofs. The completed mission compound included: the church, the priests' residence, the convento, storerooms, neophyte and visitor residences, soldiers' barracks and other structures. The mission also had a [[grist mill]], tannery, water supply system, land for farming and pastures for livestock. The whole community of priests, natives and soldiers needed to produce goods for their own livelihood.\n\nWhen the [[Mexican War of Independence]] from Spain broke out in 1810, all California missions had to become virtually self-sufficient, receiving few funds or supplies from Spanish sources. Beginning soon after [[Mexico]] won her independence from [[Spain]] in 1821, anti-Spanish feelings led to calls for expulsion of the Spanish Franciscans and [[secularization]] of the missions. Because the fledgling Mexican government had many more important problems to deal with than far-off California, [[Spanish missions in California#Mission period|actual secularization]] didn't happen until the mid-1830s.\n\n===Rancho and town===\n[[File:San Luis Obispo, 1876.jpg|thumb|right|The city in 1876]]\nAfter 1834, the mission became an ordinary parish, and most of its huge land holdings were broken up into land grants called ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]''. The ranchos were given by Mexican land grant from 1837\u20131846, with the mission itself being granted in the final year. The central community, however, remained in the same location and formed the nucleus of today's city of San Luis Obispo.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] annexed California to the United States, San Luis Obispo was the first town incorporated in the newly formed [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. It remained the center of the county to the present. Early in the American period, the region was well known for lawlessness.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title = The History of San Luis Obispo County|last = Angel|first = Myron|publisher = Thompson & West|year = 1886 |isbn= |location=CA |pages=294\u2013304}}</ref> It gained a reputation as \"Barrio del Tigre\" (or Tiger-Town) because of the endemic problem.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title = San Luis Obispo County: Looking Backward into the Middle Kingdom|last = Daniel|first = Krieger|publisher = Windsor Publications|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = 34\u201349}}</ref> Robberies and murders that left no witnesses were carried out on along the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] and elsewhere around San Luis Obispo for several years. Finally a gang of eight men committed a robbery with three murders and a kidnapping at the [[Rancho San Juan Capistrano del Camote]] in May 1858, that uncharacteristically left two witnesses alive. This brought about the formation of a [[vigilance committee]] in the County that killed one, the suspected leader of the gang [[Pio Linares]], and lynched six others, a total of seven men suspected of such misdeeds (the most lethal in California history).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>A list of vigilance committee victims for the whole of California history may be found in Ken Gonzales-Day, ''Lynching in the West'', NC: Duke University Press, 2006, 207-228.</ref> Members of the committee remained influential members of the community for decades.\n\nThe ranchos remained focused on cattle after the [[conquest of California]]. With the discovery of gold, the county experienced a major economic surge with the rising price of beef, with the highest prices coming in 1851. The county remained focused on cattle until 1863, when a drought left most ranchos devastated. Residents quickly turned to other venues, leading to the breaking up of many of the ranchos and a major change in the economic climate of the town, which focused less on cattle ranching and more on dairies, agriculture, and mined goods from then onward.\n\nSan Luis Obispo once had a burgeoning Chinatown in the vicinity of Palm St. and Chorro Street. Laborers were brought from China by [[Ah Louis]] in order to construct the [[Pacific Coast Railway]], roads connecting San Luis Obispo to [[Paso Robles, California|Paso Robles]] and Paso Robles to [[Cambria, California|Cambria]], and also the 1884 to 1894 tunneling through Cuesta Ridge for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. The town's Chinatown revolved around [[Ah Louis]] Store and other Palm Street businesses owned and run by Chinese business people. Today, Mee Heng Low chop suey shop is all that remains of the culture, although a slightly Chinatown-themed commercial development has been planned. A display of some of the unearthed relics from this period can be seen on the first floor of the Palm Street parking garage, which was built over the location where Chinatown once stood. The San Luis Obispo Historical Society (adjacent to the Mission) also contains rotating historical exhibits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/5views/5views3h2.htm |title=''Five Views: An Ethnic History Site Survey'' |publisher=Nps.gov |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>\n\nSan Luis Obispo was also a popular stop when people are on the way to Los Angeles.

Serra's [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa|original mission]] was named after the 13th-century saint and bishop [[Louis of Toulouse]]. The city, locally referred to as ''San Luis,'' ''SLO,'' or ''SLO Town'' (as its county is also referred to as ''SLO'') is the [[county seat]] of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]] and is adjacent to [[California Polytechnic State University]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American===\nThe earliest human inhabitants of the local area were the [[Chumash people]]. One of the earliest villages lies south of San Luis Obispo and reflects the landscape of the early [[Holocene]] when estuaries came farther inland. The Chumash people used marine resources of the inlets and bays along the Central Coast and inhabited a network of villages, including sites at [[Los Osos, California|Los Osos]] and [[Morro Creek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18502 |title=The Megalithic Portal |publisher=Mwegalithic.co.uk |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> The tribal site on present-day San Luis Obispo was named ''ti\u0142hini'', [[Obispe\u00f1o language|Obispe\u00f1o]] for \"Place of the full moon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.calpoly.edu/ytt |title=yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u resources - University Housing - Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo |publisher=Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo University Housing |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n\n===Mission period===\nDuring the [[Spanish Empire]] expansion throughout the world, specifically in 1769, Franciscan [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] received orders from Spain to bring the Catholic faith to the natives of [[Alta California]]; the idea was to unify the empire under the same religion and language. [[Mission San Diego]] was the first [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish mission]] founded in Alta California that same year.\n\nOn September 7, 1769, an expedition led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e1]] entered the San Luis Obispo area from coastal areas around today's [[Pismo Beach, California|Pismo Beach]]. One of the expedition's three diarists, padre [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]], recorded the name given to this area by the soldiers as ''Ca\u00f1ada de Los Osos'' (\"ca\u00f1ada\" translates as \"valley\" or \"canyon\"). The party traveled north along San Luis Obispo Creek, turned west through Los Osos Valley, and reached [[Morro Bay, California|Morro Bay]] on September 9.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=184\u2013187 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |location= |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2019-12-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1770, Portola established the [[Presidio of Monterey]] and Jun\u00edpero Serra founded the second mission, [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo|San Carlos Borromeo]], in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. The mission was moved to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the following year. As supplies dwindled in 1772 at the mission and Presidio, the people faced starvation. Remembering the Valley of the Bears, [[Presidio of Monterey]] commander [[Pedro Fages]] (a member of the [[Portol\u00e0 expedition]]) led a hunting expedition to bring back food. Over twenty-five mule loads of dried bear meat and seed were sent north to relieve the missionaries, soldiers, and neophytes (baptized natives). The natives were impressed at the ease by which the Spaniards could take down the huge grizzlies with their weapons. Some of the bear meat was traded with the local people in exchange for edible seed. It was after this that Jun\u00edpero Serra decided that La Ca\u00f1ada de Los Osos would be an ideal place for the fifth mission.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe area had abundant supplies of food and water, the climate was also very mild, and the local [[Chumash people|Chumash]] were very friendly. With soldiers, muleteers, and pack animals carrying mission supplies, Jun\u00edpero Serra set out from Carmel to reach the Valley of the Bears. On September 1, 1772, Jun\u00edpero Serra celebrated the first Mass with a cross erected near San Luis Creek. The very next day, he departed for San Diego leaving Fr. Jos\u00e9 Cavaller, with the difficult task of building the mission. Fr. [[Jos\u00e9 Cavaller]], five soldiers and two neophytes began building [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]] ({{langnf||Spanish|\"[[Louis of Toulouse|St. Louis]] Bishop of Toulouse\"}}) which would later become the town of San Luis Obispo.\n\nThe first mission structures were built with whatever materials could be found nearby. Later, more permanent buildings were constructed with [[adobe]] walls, wood timber roof beams and tile roofs. The completed mission compound included: the church, the priests' residence, the convento, storerooms, neophyte and visitor residences, soldiers' barracks and other structures. The mission also had a [[grist mill]], tannery, water supply system, land for farming and pastures for livestock. The whole community of priests, natives and soldiers needed to produce goods for their own livelihood.\n\nWhen the [[Mexican War of Independence]] from Spain broke out in 1810, all California missions had to become virtually self-sufficient, receiving few funds or supplies from Spanish sources. Beginning soon after [[Mexico]] won her independence from [[Spain]] in 1821, anti-Spanish feelings led to calls for expulsion of the Spanish Franciscans and [[secularization]] of the missions. Because the fledgling Mexican government had many more important problems to deal with than far-off California, [[Spanish missions in California#Mission period|actual secularization]] didn't happen until the mid-1830s.\n\n===Rancho and town===\n[[File:San Luis Obispo, 1876.jpg|thumb|right|The city in 1876]]\nAfter 1834, the mission became an ordinary parish, and most of its huge land holdings were broken up into land grants called ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]''. The ranchos were given by Mexican land grant from 1837\u20131846, with the mission itself being granted in the final year. The central community, however, remained in the same location and formed the nucleus of today's city of San Luis Obispo.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] annexed California to the United States, San Luis Obispo was the first town incorporated in the newly formed [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. It remained the center of the county to the present. Early in the American period, the region was well known for lawlessness.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title = The History of San Luis Obispo County|last = Angel|first = Myron|publisher = Thompson & West|year = 1886 |isbn= |location=CA |pages=294\u2013304}}</ref> It gained a reputation as \"Barrio del Tigre\" (or Tiger-Town) because of the endemic problem.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title = San Luis Obispo County: Looking Backward into the Middle Kingdom|last = Daniel|first = Krieger|publisher = Windsor Publications|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = 34\u201349}}</ref> Robberies and murders that left no witnesses were carried out on along the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] and elsewhere around San Luis Obispo for several years. Finally a gang of eight men committed a robbery with three murders and a kidnapping at the [[Rancho San Juan Capistrano del Camote]] in May 1858, that uncharacteristically left two witnesses alive. This brought about the formation of a [[vigilance committee]] in the County that killed one, the suspected leader of the gang [[Pio Linares]], and lynched six others, a total of seven men suspected of such misdeeds (the most lethal in California history).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>A list of vigilance committee victims for the whole of California history may be found in Ken Gonzales-Day, ''Lynching in the West'', NC: Duke University Press, 2006, 207-228.</ref> Members of the committee remained influential members of the community for decades.\n\nThe ranchos remained focused on cattle after the [[conquest of California]]. With the discovery of gold, the county experienced a major economic surge with the rising price of beef, with the highest prices coming in 1851. The county remained focused on cattle until 1863, when a drought left most ranchos devastated. Residents quickly turned to other venues, leading to the breaking up of many of the ranchos and a major change in the economic climate of the town, which focused less on cattle ranching and more on dairies, agriculture, and mined goods from then onward.\n\nSan Luis Obispo once had a burgeoning Chinatown in the vicinity of Palm St. and Chorro Street. Laborers were brought from China by [[Ah Louis]] in order to construct the [[Pacific Coast Railway]], roads connecting San Luis Obispo to [[Paso Robles, California|Paso Robles]] and Paso Robles to [[Cambria, California|Cambria]], and also the 1884 to 1894 tunneling through Cuesta Ridge for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. The town's Chinatown revolved around [[Ah Louis]] Store and other Palm Street businesses owned and run by Chinese business people. Today, Mee Heng Low chop suey shop is all that remains of the culture, although a slightly Chinatown-themed commercial development has been planned. A display of some of the unearthed relics from this period can be seen on the first floor of the Palm Street parking garage, which was built over the location where Chinatown once stood. The San Luis Obispo Historical Society (adjacent to the Mission) also contains rotating historical exhibits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/5views/5views3h2.htm |title=''Five Views: An Ethnic History Site Survey'' |publisher=Nps.gov |df=mdy-all |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref>\n\nSan Luis Obispo was also a popular stop when people are on the way to Los Angeles. [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] and [[California State Route 1]] with the rise of car culture. Due to its popularity as a stop, it was the location of the first [[motel]] in the world, the [[Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo|Milestone Mo-Tel]].\n\nSan Luis Obispo's largest and oldest voluntary organization is the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce, which also is the oldest and largest voluntary organization in San Luis Obispo County.\n\n===Historic buildings and districts===\n{{Main|City of San Luis Obispo Historic Resources}}\n\nSan Luis Obispo has more than 180 historic buildings that have been designated as [[City of San Luis Obispo Historic Resources]].

It is the second largest bank in [[Mexico]]. The Banamex Financial Group was purchased by [[Citigroup]] in August 2001 for $12.5 billion [[United States dollar|USD]]. It continues to operate as a Citigroup [[subsidiary]].\n\n==History==\nBanamex was formed on 2 June 1884 from the merger of two banks, '''Banco Nacional Mexicano''' and '''Banco Mercantil Mexicano''', which had operated since the beginning of 1882. The newly founded bank had branches in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]], [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], [[Guanajuato]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], and opened a branch in [[Guadalajara]]. The bank was reorganized in 1926, becoming a financing bank and establishing the first agency of a Latin American bank in [[New York City]].\n\nBanamex gradually introduced several financial product innovations to the Mexican market including savings accounts (in 1929), personal credit lines (in 1958), credit cards (in 1968), and ATM banking (in 1972). In 1981, Banamex acquired the [[California Commerce Bank]].\n\n[[Image:FacadeBanamexBldgCentroDF.JPG|thumb|left|Facade of the Banamex building located on the corner of Carranza and Palma streets in the [[Centro (Mexico City)|historic center]] of [[Mexico City]].]]\nIn the midst of a severe economic crisis (1982), President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] announced a major devaluation of the peso and nationalized all private banks in Mexico. For the next nine years Banamex operated as a government owned national credit association. In 1991, Banamex was reprivatized and it established Grupo Financiero Banamex\u2013Accival with the investment bank Acciones y Valores de M\u00e9xico (Accival).\n\nFor the next four years Banamex and the rest of the Mexican private banks presided over an unprecedented expansion of private credit in Mexico. This expansion occurred in an environment characterized by: i) the lack of a credit culture at the newly privatized banks, which had been bought at rich multiples by individuals and organizations without lending experience, and ii) lax oversight by regulatory authorities, which led in some instances to the occurrence of irregular transactions (such as related party transactions).\n\nThe result of this aggressive expansion of credit was to strain the bank's balance sheet ([[loan portfolio quality]] ratios and [[capital adequacy ratio|capitalization]] ratios). The December 1994 macro-devaluation of the Mexican pesos (see the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|December Mistake]]) and the ensuing significant increase in domestic interest rates coupled with a dramatic [[recession|economic recession]], caused Banamex's and much of the rest of the privatized banks to essentially become insolvent.\n\n[[Image:Banamex logo.png|thumb|right|Banamex former logo used from the 1990s until 2016]] \nIn order to avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of generalized bank bankruptcies, the [[Ernesto Zedillo]] administration decided to rescue the troubled banks through a government fund ([[Instituto de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario]] or IPAB, later called [[Fondo Bancario de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro]] or [[Fobaproa]]). IPAB enticed the banks' shareholders to inject fresh equity into the banks by pledging to buy from the banks [[non-performing loans]] in a two to one (or in some cases greater) ratio with respect to the newly injected fresh capital in exchange for a long-dated government note with capitalized interest. Banamex eventually sold $_ worth of non-performing loans to IPAB, and its shareholders injected $_ of fresh equity. The combination of these measures coupled with a recovery of the Mexican economy helped clean up the bank's balance sheet.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2001 [[Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Ram\u00edrez]] was the CEO. In 1997, Afore Banamex was created to access the newly created private pension fund market. \n \nOn 6 August 2001, [[Citigroup|Citigroup Inc.]] acquired Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival for US$12.5 billion, which became Grupo Financiero Banamex. This was the largest-ever U.S.-Mexico corporate merger. Grupo Financiero Banamex's operations were integrated with Citibank's relatively small existing Mexico business under the Banamex brand name.\n\nIn October 2014, allegations were made that employees had taken millions of dollars in kickbacks from vendors. Authorities in Mexico and the United States are investigating the allegations. Citigroup encouraged Manuel Medina-Mora to resign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/citigroup-says-earnings-rise-13-as-it-discloses-a-second-inquiry-in-mexico/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|title=Another Scandal Hits Citigroup's Moneymaking Mexican Division|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiaries==\n[[File:Banamex ATM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Banamex ATM in [[Puerto Vallarta]]]]\nThe following are subsidiaries of Grupo Financiero Banamex:\n* Banamex\n* Accival \n* Afore Banamex\n* Seguros Banamex\n* Arrendadora Banamex\n* Operadora e Impulsora de Negocios\n* Acci\u00f3n Banamex\n* Pensiones Banamex\n* Fomento Cultural\n* Fomento Social\n\n===Banamex USA===\nAfter Citigroup's purchase of Banamex in 2001, Banamex decided to expand into the U.S. by opening a subsidiary in the country and creating Banamex USA.

And so, he commits to being with Carolina. Against the advice of his girlfriend and co-worker Carolina ([[Ana de Armas]]), Sergio decides to go to [[Baghdad]] after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] in order to help Iraqis achieve independence and negotiate the withdrawal of American troops. He comes to a disagreement with American diplomat [[Paul Bremer]] who opposes his methods despite the pressure from the United States, and fights against the U.S. occupation of Iraq. He even insists on not having U.S. guards at the UN's base camp in order to separate themselves from the U.S. occupiers.\n\nSergio is killed by a terrorist attack that takes place on the UN base camp. Later, the U.S. pulls out of Iraq leading to a long Civil War, but Sergio's gravely injured colleague Gil ([[Brian F.
