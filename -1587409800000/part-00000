The key to that seal was split in two, one half given to the gods and the other to demons, so that they would never be united and Bahamut never released. Now, two thousand years later, the world is in an era of peace until the day a woman named Amira appears with the gods' half of the key. With an apparent loss of memory, she searches for her lost mother and is assisted by the bounty hunters Favaro Leone and Kaisar Lidfard.
