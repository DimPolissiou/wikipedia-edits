{"title_page": "Martial law in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Authorised military government in the United States}}\n'''Martial law in the United States''' refers to several periods in [[History of the United States|United States history]] where in a region or the [[United States]] as a whole were placed under the control of a military body. On a federal level, only the president has the power to impose [[martial law]]{{cn|date=March 2020}}. In each state, the governor has the right to impose martial law within the borders of the state{{cn|date=March 2020}}. In the United States, martial law has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as New Orleans during the [[Battle of New Orleans]]; after major disasters, such as the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 or the San Francisco [[earthquake of 1906]] or during riots, such as the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]] or the [[Will_Lockett#Murder_of_Geneva_Hardman_and_riots|1920 Lexington riots]]; local leaders declared martial law to protect themselves from mob violence, such as [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], during the [[Illinois Mormon War]], or [[Utah]] during the [[Utah War]]; or in response to chaos associated with protests and rioting, such as the [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike]], in Hawaii after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], and during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in response to the [[Cambridge riot of 1963]].\n\nThe martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which is, in essence, the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend ''habeas corpus'' is related to the imposition of martial law.<ref>{{cite book |author=G.

The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and [[military justice]]: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and that is one of the keys, as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] noted, to martial law.\n\nIn [[United States law]], martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War II]]. In 1878, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which forbids [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.\n\nThroughout [[United States history]] are several examples of the imposition of martial law, aside from that during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==The American Revolution==\n[[File: Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|225px|The Boston Tea Party prompted Great Britain to pass the [[Massachusetts Government Act]].]]\nAs a result of the [[Boston Tea Party]], [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], one of the [[Intolerable Acts]], which suppressed town meetings and assemblies, and imposed appointed government, tantamount to martial law.<ref>colonial-america.suite101.com/article.cfm/law-that-started-the-american-revolution</ref><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1920256 \"Governors or Generals?: A Note on Martial Law and the Revolution of 1689 in English America\"], Ian Steele, ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 46, No. 2 (Apr. 1989), pp. 304\u2013314</ref><ref>[http://www.oldsouthmeetinghouse.org/osmh_123456789files/TeaPartyTimeline.aspx \"Home > Boston Tea Party > A Tea Party Timeline: 1773\u20131775\"], ''Old South Meeting House''</ref>\n\n==New Orleans, Louisiana in the War of 1812==\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], [[General (United States)|US General]] [[Andrew Jackson]] imposed martial law in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], before repulsing the British in the [[Battle of New Orleans]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4233516 \"The Battle of New Orleans Reconsidered: Andrew Jackson and Martial Law\"], Matthew Warshauer, ''Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association'', Vol. 39, No. 3 (Summer, 1998), pp. 261\u2013291</ref><ref>[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/aj7/about/bio/jack07.htm \"A National Hero, the Battle of New Orleans\"], ''Andrew Jackson (1767\u20131845)''</ref><ref>[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.5/br_38.html \"Book Review: Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law: Nationalism, Civil Liberties, and Partisanship.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905045153/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.5/br_38.html |date=2012-09-05 }}, ''American Historical Review'', December 2007</ref> Martial law was also imposed in a four-mile radius around the vicinity. When word came of the end of the war, Jackson maintained martial law, contending that he had not gotten official word of the peace. A judge demanded ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for a man arrested for sedition. Rather than comply with the writ, Jackson had the judge arrested.\n\n==Nauvoo, Illinois, during the Illinois Mormon War==\n{{main|Illinois Mormon War}}\n\nIn 1843, Missouri sought to extradite [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[Mormonism]], for allegedly [[Attempted assassination of Lilburn Boggs|attempting to murder Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs]]. He escaped arrest with the help of members of his church, and was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus in the [[Municipal Court of Nauvoo]], where he was mayor, even though it was outside the court's jurisdiction. People in the neighboring town of [[Carthage, Illinois]], felt that Smith was abusing his position in order to avoid arrest. They requested that Governor Ford call out the militia to take Smith into custody, to which Governor Ford declined.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW0sBgAAQBAJ|title=Prairie Justice: A History of Illinois Courts under French, English, and American Law|author=Roger L Severns|publisher=SIU Press|year=2015}}</ref>{{rp|139}} A group of ex-Mormons published a paper called the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' which detailed Smith's alleged abuse of power. Together with the [[Nauvoo City Council]], Smith ordered the destruction of the ''Nauvoo Expositor''. This caused an uproar in neighboring towns, which interpreted the order as an attack on the freedom of speech. Smith was charged with causing a riot, which the Nauvoo courts dismissed.  Neighboring cities raised money for a militia to go and capture Smith.<ref name=Oaks /> Governor Ford arrived in Carthage and sent word to Smith that if he did not surrender, Ford would call out the militia.

In 1857, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Buchanan]] sent U.S. forces to the [[Utah Territory]] in what became known as the Utah War. The [[Mormon]]s, fearing that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them, made preparations for defense. On 15 September, Young publicly declared martial law in Utah. It was widely circulated throughout the territory and was delivered by messenger to Col. Alexander with the approaching army. The most important provision forbade \"all armed forces of every description from coming into this Territory, under any pretense whatsoever\".<ref name=procHafen>\"Proclamation of Governor Young\", [[Leroy R. Hafen]] & Ann W. Hafen (eds.), ''Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857\u20131858'', p. 65.</ref> It also commanded that \"all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice to repel any and all such invasion\".<ref name=procHafen/> But more important to California- and Oregon-bound travelers was the third section that stated, \"Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory...and no person shall be allowed to pass or repass into, through or from this territory without a permit from the proper officer.\"<ref name=procHafen/> Brigham Young ordered the people in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], to burn their homes and retreat south to [[Provo, Utah]]. Meanwhile, the Mormons harassed the approaching army. Eventually, Brigham Young was removed as governor and replaced by [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].\n\n==''Ex parte Milligan''==\nOn September 15, 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] imposed Congressionally authorized martial law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_mlaw.html|title=Constitutional Topic: Martial Law - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net|publisher=}}</ref> The authorizing act allowed the President to suspend ''habeas corpus'' throughout the entire United States (which he had already done under his own authority on April 27, 1861). Lincoln imposed the suspension on \"prisoners of war, spies, or aiders and abettors of the enemy,\" as well as on other classes of people, such as draft dodgers. The President's proclamation was challenged in ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'', 71 US 2 [1866]. The Supreme Court ruled that Lincoln's imposition of martial law (by way of suspension of ''habeas corpus'') was unconstitutional in areas where the local courts were still in session.\n\n==The Great Chicago Fire==\n[[File:Chicago in Flames by Currier & Ives, 1871 (cropped).jpg|thumb|225px|upright=1.5|Artist's rendering of the Great Chicago Fire]]\nIn response to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, [[Chicago]] mayor [[Roswell B. Mason]] declared a state of martial law and placed General [[Philip Sheridan]] in charge of the city on October 9, 1871. After the fire was extinguished, there were no widespread disturbances and martial law was lifted within a few days.<ref>, Morris, Roy, Jr., ''Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan'', Crown Publishing, 1992, pp. 335\u20138. {{ISBN|0-517-58070-5}}.</ref>\n\n==Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 1892==\nIn 1892, in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], striking mineworkers blew up a mill and shot at strike-breaking workers. The explosion leveled a four-story building and killed one person. The governor declared martial law. At the same time, a request was made for federal troops to back guardsmen. Over 600 people were arrested. The list was whittled down to two dozen [[wikt: ringleader|ringleader]]s who were tried in the military court. While in prison, the mine workers formed a new union, the [[Western Federation of Miners]].\n\n==San Francisco earthquake of 1906==\nFollowing the [[earthquake of 1906]], the federal troops stationed in the Presidio were pressed into martial law service. They were posted throughout the city, and all dynamite was confiscated. The dynamite was used to destroy buildings in the path of fires, to prevent the fires from spreading.\n\n==Colorado Coalfield War==\nIn 1914, the imposition of martial law climaxed during the [[Colorado Coalfield War]]. Dating back decades, the conflicts came to a head in [[Ludlow, Colorado]], in 1913. The [[Colorado National Guard]] was called in to quell the strikers. For a time, the peace was kept, but it is reported that the make-up of the Guard stationed at the mines began to shift from impartial normal troops to companies of loyal mine guards. Clashes increased and the proclamation of martial law was made by the governor, eventually resulting in the [[Ludlow Massacre]]. [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] sent in federal troops, eventually ending the violence.\n\nOn August 19, 1917, the Spokane office of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW, or Wobblies) was raided, leaders arrested, and martial law was declared. The military authority was the National Guard, controlled by the U.S. War Department. This occurred in reaction to a demand by IWW leader James Rowan that all prisoners of the \"class war\" (he meant Wobbly strikers and strike leaders involved in a statewide lumber strike) be released or Spokane would face a general strike. The repression of the democratic, radical union in Spokane and across the state took place in the context of the Wobbly-led loggers' and sawmill workers' ongoing strike for the eight-hour day and sanitary conditions in the camps. The IWW was militant, radical, vocal and consistently nonviolent. The larger context of the repression of the union was war hysteria, combined with employer opposition to union demands.

If his soldiers found any union miners, they immediately took them and imprisoned them. The jails filled up so quickly that he had to release miners. As it went, miners were arrested, jailed, and released without any sort of trial. After a time, when the trial of [[Sid Hatfield]] began, the military occupation and \"veritable [[military dictatorship]]\" (Governor Cornwell) of the army officer ended.

On a federal level, only the president has the power to impose [[martial law]]{{cn|date=March 2020}}. In each state, the governor has the right to impose martial law within the borders of the state{{cn|date=March 2020}}. In the United States, martial law has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as New Orleans during the [[Battle of New Orleans]]; after major disasters, such as the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 or the San Francisco [[earthquake of 1906]] or during riots, such as the [[Omaha race riot of 1919]] or the [[Will_Lockett#Murder_of_Geneva_Hardman_and_riots|1920 Lexington riots]]; local leaders declared martial law to protect themselves from mob violence, such as [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], during the [[Illinois Mormon War]], or [[Utah]] during the [[Utah War]]; or in response to chaos associated with protests and rioting, such as the [[1934 West Coast waterfront strike]], in Hawaii after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], and during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in response to the [[Cambridge riot of 1963]].\n\nThe martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which is, in essence, the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend ''habeas corpus'' is related to the imposition of martial law.<ref>{{cite book |author=G.

The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and [[military justice]]: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and that is one of the keys, as the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] noted, to martial law.\n\nIn [[United States law]], martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the [[American Civil War]] and [[World War II]]. In 1878, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], which forbids [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.\n\nThroughout [[United States history]] are several examples of the imposition of martial law, aside from that during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==The American Revolution==\n[[File: Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|225px|The Boston Tea Party prompted Great Britain to pass the [[Massachusetts Government Act]].]]\nAs a result of the [[Boston Tea Party]], [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], one of the [[Intolerable Acts]], which suppressed town meetings and assemblies, and imposed appointed government, tantamount to martial law.<ref>colonial-america.suite101.com/article.cfm/law-that-started-the-american-revolution</ref><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1920256 \"Governors or Generals?: A Note on Martial Law and the Revolution of 1689 in English America\"], Ian Steele, ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 46, No. 2 (Apr. 1989), pp. 304\u2013314</ref><ref>[http://www.oldsouthmeetinghouse.org/osmh_123456789files/TeaPartyTimeline.aspx \"Home > Boston Tea Party > A Tea Party Timeline: 1773\u20131775\"], ''Old South Meeting House''</ref>\n\n==New Orleans, Louisiana in the War of 1812==\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], [[General (United States)|US General]] [[Andrew Jackson]] imposed martial law in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], before repulsing the British in the [[Battle of New Orleans]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4233516 \"The Battle of New Orleans Reconsidered: Andrew Jackson and Martial Law\"], Matthew Warshauer, ''Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association'', Vol. 39, No. 3 (Summer, 1998), pp. 261\u2013291</ref><ref>[http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/aj7/about/bio/jack07.htm \"A National Hero, the Battle of New Orleans\"], ''Andrew Jackson (1767\u20131845)''</ref><ref>[http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.5/br_38.html \"Book Review: Andrew Jackson and the Politics of Martial Law: Nationalism, Civil Liberties, and Partisanship.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905045153/http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/112.5/br_38.html |date=2012-09-05 }}, ''American Historical Review'', December 2007</ref> Martial law was also imposed in a four-mile radius around the vicinity. When word came of the end of the war, Jackson maintained martial law, contending that he had not gotten official word of the peace.

Rather than comply with the writ, Jackson had the judge arrested.\n\n==Nauvoo, Illinois, during the Illinois Mormon War==\n{{main|Illinois Mormon War}}\n\nIn 1843, Missouri sought to extradite [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of [[Mormonism]], for allegedly [[Attempted assassination of Lilburn Boggs|attempting to murder Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs]]. He escaped arrest with the help of members of his church, and was discharged on a writ of habeas corpus in the [[Municipal Court of Nauvoo]], where he was mayor, even though it was outside the court's jurisdiction. People in the neighboring town of [[Carthage, Illinois]], felt that Smith was abusing his position in order to avoid arrest. They requested that Governor Ford call out the militia to take Smith into custody, to which Governor Ford declined.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zW0sBgAAQBAJ|title=Prairie Justice: A History of Illinois Courts under French, English, and American Law|author=Roger L Severns|publisher=SIU Press|year=2015}}</ref>{{rp|139}} A group of ex-Mormons published a paper called the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' which detailed Smith's alleged abuse of power.

In 1857, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Buchanan]] sent U.S. forces to the [[Utah Territory]] in what became known as the Utah War. The [[Mormon]]s, fearing that the large U.S. military force had been sent to annihilate them, made preparations for defense. On 15 September, Young publicly declared martial law in Utah. It was widely circulated throughout the territory and was delivered by messenger to Col. Alexander with the approaching army. The most important provision forbade \"all armed forces of every description from coming into this Territory, under any pretense whatsoever\".<ref name=procHafen>\"Proclamation of Governor Young\", [[Leroy R. Hafen]] & Ann W. Hafen (eds.), ''Mormon Resistance: A Documentary Account of the Utah Expedition, 1857\u20131858'', p. 65.</ref> It also commanded that \"all the forces in said Territory hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice to repel any and all such invasion\".<ref name=procHafen/> But more important to California- and Oregon-bound travelers was the third section that stated, \"Martial law is hereby declared to exist in this Territory...and no person shall be allowed to pass or repass into, through or from this territory without a permit from the proper officer.\"<ref name=procHafen/> Brigham Young ordered the people in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], to burn their homes and retreat south to [[Provo, Utah]]. Meanwhile, the Mormons harassed the approaching army. Eventually, Brigham Young was removed as governor and replaced by [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]].\n\n==''Ex parte Milligan''==\nOn September 15, 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] imposed Congressionally authorized martial law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_mlaw.html|title=Constitutional Topic: Martial Law - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net|publisher=}}</ref> The authorizing act allowed the President to suspend ''habeas corpus'' throughout the entire United States (which he had already done under his own authority on April 27, 1861). Lincoln imposed the suspension on \"prisoners of war, spies, or aiders and abettors of the enemy,\" as well as on other classes of people, such as draft dodgers. The President's proclamation was challenged in ''[[Ex parte Milligan]]'', 71 US 2 [1866]. The Supreme Court ruled that Lincoln's imposition of martial law (by way of suspension of ''habeas corpus'') was unconstitutional in areas where the local courts were still in session.\n\n==The Great Chicago Fire==\n[[File:Chicago in Flames by Currier & Ives, 1871 (cropped).jpg|thumb|225px|upright=1.5|Artist's rendering of the Great Chicago Fire]]\nIn response to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, [[Chicago]] mayor [[Roswell B. Mason]] declared a state of martial law and placed General [[Philip Sheridan]] in charge of the city on October 9, 1871. After the fire was extinguished, there were no widespread disturbances and martial law was lifted within a few days.<ref>, Morris, Roy, Jr., ''Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan'', Crown Publishing, 1992, pp. 335\u20138. {{ISBN|0-517-58070-5}}.</ref>\n\n==Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 1892==\nIn 1892, in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], striking mineworkers blew up a mill and shot at strike-breaking workers. The explosion leveled a four-story building and killed one person. The governor declared martial law. At the same time, a request was made for federal troops to back guardsmen. Over 600 people were arrested. The list was whittled down to two dozen [[wikt: ringleader|ringleader]]s who were tried in the military court. While in prison, the mine workers formed a new union, the [[Western Federation of Miners]].\n\n==San Francisco earthquake of 1906==\nFollowing the [[earthquake of 1906]], the federal troops stationed in the Presidio were pressed into martial law service. They were posted throughout the city, and all dynamite was confiscated. The dynamite was used to destroy buildings in the path of fires, to prevent the fires from spreading.\n\n==Colorado Coalfield War==\nIn 1914, the imposition of martial law climaxed during the [[Colorado Coalfield War]]. Dating back decades, the conflicts came to a head in [[Ludlow, Colorado]] in 1913. The [[Colorado National Guard]] was called in to quell the strikers. For a time, the peace was kept, but it is reported that the make-up of the Guard stationed at the mines began to shift from impartial normal troops to companies of loyal mine guards. Clashes increased and the proclamation of martial law was made by the governor, eventually resulting in the [[Ludlow Massacre]]. [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] sent in federal troops, eventually ending the violence.\n\nOn August 19, 1917, the Spokane office of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW, or Wobblies) was raided, leaders arrested, and martial law was declared. The military authority was the National Guard, controlled by the U.S. War Department. This occurred in reaction to a demand by IWW leader James Rowan that all prisoners of the \"class war\" (he meant Wobbly strikers and strike leaders involved in a statewide lumber strike) be released or Spokane would face a general strike. The repression of the democratic, radical union in Spokane and across the state took place in the context of the Wobbly-led loggers' and sawmill workers' ongoing strike for the eight-hour day and sanitary conditions in the camps. The IWW was militant, radical, vocal and consistently nonviolent. The larger context of the repression of the union was war hysteria, combined with employer opposition to union demands. The nationwide suppression of the IWW during the war involved physical violence, vandalism, and the imprisonment of hundreds of union members and leaders.\n\n==West Virginia Coal Wars==\nDuring the events of the [[West Virginia Coal Wars]] (1920\u20131921), martial law was declared in the state of West Virginia. At the behest of [[John J. Cornwell|Governor Cornwell]], federal troops had been dispatched to Mingo County to deal with the striking miners.
