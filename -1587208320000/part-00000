[[Aman Verma (actor)|Aman Verma]], [[Samir Soni]], Saahil Chadha and Nasir Khan portray Bachchan and Malini's four sons. [[Mahima Chaudhry]], [[Paresh Rawal]], [[Rimi Sen]] and [[Lilette Dubey]] are also featured in supporting roles.\n\nThis film was an unofficial adaptation of the highly acclaimed 1937 Hollywood film ''[[Make Way for Tomorrow]]'' which had been adapted on screen multiple times - in Japanese in 1953 as ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' , in Marathi in 1954 as ''Oon Paus'' , in Kannada in 1958 as ''[[School Master (1958 film)|School Master]]'' (which was remade in four languages including in Hindi in 1959 as ''[[School Master (1959 film)|School Master]]''), in Pakistani in 1972 as ''Samaj'' , in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] in 1972 as ''[[Badi Panthulu]]'', in Hindi in 1976 as ''[[Zindagi (1976 film)|Zindagi]]'' , in Tamil in 1990 as ''[[Varavu Nalla Uravu]]''. ''Baghban'' was remade in [[Kannada]] as ''[[Ee Bandhana]]'' in 2007, starring [[Vishnuvardhan (actor)|Vishnuvardhan]] and [[Jaya Pradha]] in the leads.\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/oct/02baghban.htm|title=Kerchief caper!|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> especially for the on-screen chemistry between Bachchan and Malini who came together after a gap of 20 years from ''[[Nastik (1983 film)|Nastik]]'' (1983).

The couple has provided their children with everything, often at the cost of Pooja\u2019s and Raj\u2019s own requirements. The Malhotras have an adopted son Alok ([[Salman Khan]]), who is in love with Arpita ([[Mahima Chaudhry]]). Alok was an orphan and Raj provided him with money and education, bringing him up as his own son. Now a successful man, Alok worships Raj because of all his help and thinks of him as his father.\n\nAn elderly couple wish their children to care for them in their old age. But their children see and treat them as a burden, and they must struggle to regain their worth and dignity to themselves and others.\n\nRaj has a flourishing job. But, once he retires, he is unable to support himself and has to vacate the house he and Pooja have shared for years. They decide to live with their kids to enjoy their love and affection. However, their kids do not want them. The children decide to split the parents up, each parent going to live with one of the sons for the next six months. The children think their parents will refuse the offer and therefore, they will remain in their home. However, the parents reluctantly accept the offer.\n\nThe parents endure this separation as well as horrible treatment from their children, after all, they have sacrificed for them. Their grandson, Rahul, is the only one who gives Raj love and affection. Saddened by the treatment he has received from his children and their families, Raj writes down his feelings about how he fulfilled his children's dreams and, in return, how they treat him, as well as his love for his wife, and how much pain their separation has caused. His writing eventually becomes a novel. Pooja, meanwhile, endures abuse from her son and daughter-in-law([[Suman Ranganathan]]), as well as her granddaughter, Payal ([[Rimi Sen]]). Payal, though, realizes her mistake when Pooja saves her from her boyfriend's sexual advances and nurtures Pooja with love.\n\nWhile changing their trains after six months, Pooja and Raj spend some time together in Vijaynagar. There they suddenly meet Alok, who takes them to his home and gives them the importance and care which their real sons did not. Raj finds out that his writing has become a published book named ''Baghban''. This book becomes a big hit, selling the first copies immediately. Raj, as a result, gains the money he needs to support himself and Pooja in their old age. Their sons ask their parents for forgiveness to achieve this end. Payal and Rahul ([[Master Yash Pathak]]) (Sanjay's son), though, realize their true motives and refuse to come with their parents. Raj is honored for his work, and the four sons attend with their wives. But when they ask Pooja and Raj to forgive them, they instead refuse and disown them for the pain their sons have put them through.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] <small>as</small> Raj Malhotra\n* [[Hema Malini]] <small>as</small> Pooja Malhotra \n* [[Salman Khan]] <small>as</small> Alok Raj Malhotra, adopted son of Raj and Pooja and Arpita Husband. \n* [[Mahima Chaudhry]] <small>as</small> Arpita Raj Malhotra, Alok's wife\n* [[Aman Verma (actor)|Aman Verma]] <small>as</small> Ajay Malhotra, Raj's first son\n* [[Samir Soni]] <small>as</small> Sanjay Malhotra, Raj's second son \n* Saahil Chadha <small>as</small> Rohit Malhotra, Raj's third son\n* Nasirr Khan <small>as</small> Karan Malhotra, Raj's fourth son\n* [[Suman Ranganathan]] <small>as</small> Kiran Malhotra, Ajay's wife\n* [[Rimi Sen]] <small>as</small> Payal Malhotra, Ajay and Kiran's Spoiled daughter\n* [[Divya Dutta]] <small>as</small> Reena Malhotra, Sanjay's wife\n* [[Master Yash Pathak]] <small>as</small> Rahul Malhotra, Sanjay and Reena's son\n* [[Arzoo Govitrikar]]   <small>as</small> Priya Malhotra, Rohit's wife\n*[[Harsh Vashisht|Harsh Vashisth]] as Payal's Boyfriend. \n* [[Paresh Rawal]] <small>as</small> Hemantbhai Patel \n* [[Lilette Dubey]] <small>as</small> Shanti Patel\n* [[Sharat Saxena]] <small>as</small> Ram Avtaar\n* [[Mohan Joshi]] <small>as</small> Khuber Desai, Hotel Owner\n* [[Nakul Vaid]] <small>as</small> Kapil; Nilli's boyfriend\n* [[Avtar Gill]] <small>as</small> Rawat Sab, ICICI Bank Manager\n* [[Asrani]] <small>as</small> Bedi Sab (Sardar)\n* Shashi Kiran <small>as</small> Pritam\n* [[Gajendra Chouhan]] <small>as</small> Alok's employee\n* [[Sanjeeda Sheikh]] <small>as</small> Nilli; Kapil's girlfriend\n* [[Anang Desai]] <small>as</small> Mr. Verma (Kapil's Dad); Raj's Publisher\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to film expert Rajesh Subramanian, B.

It took place among the [[Aegates Islands]], off the western coast of the island of [[Sicily]]. The Carthaginians were commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], and the Romans were under the overall authority of [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], but [[Quintus Valerius Falto]] commanded during the battle. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.\n\nThe Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as [[marines]]. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet, which was further handicapped by being laden with supplies and having not yet embarked its full complement of marines.\n\nAs a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Lutatius]], by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial [[War reparations|reparations]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.{{sfn|Royal|Tusa|2019|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n==Background==\n===Operations in Sicily===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC, the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River [[Arno]] had recently been [[Roman expansion in Italy|unified under Roman control]]. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n===Ships===\n\nDuring this period the standard Mediterranean warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100 [[tonne]]s (110 [[short tons]]; 100 [[long tons]]). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested that they could maintain 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Average speeds of 5\u20136 knots (6\u20137 mph; 9\u201311 kph) were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=283}}\n\nVessels were built as cataphract, or \"protected\", ships, with a closed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}} The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets \u2013 or files \u2013 of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=101}}\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a [[trireme]]|{{center|Depiction of the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek trireme}}]]\n\nThe Romans had little prior naval experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their Latin or Greek allies.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}} In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and thus slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], although [[hexareme]]s (six oarsmen per bank), [[quadriremes]] (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So [[wikt:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines;{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]], and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} Ideally one would attack an enemy ship from its side or rear, thus avoiding the possibility of being rammed oneself. Skill was required to impact an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one's own galley in the stricken enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship on ship combats which have been likened to aerial [[dogfight]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===264\u2013250 BC===\n\nLargely because of the Romans' invention of the {{lang|la|[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]}}, a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] (260 BC), [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] (257 BC), [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] (256 BC) and [[Battle of Cape Hermaea|Cape Hermaeum]] (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the {{lang|la|corvus}} may have contributed to this disaster.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} In any event, they did not use the {{lang|la|corvus}} thereafter.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=86}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nThe Carthaginians regained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories over the blockading Roman fleet at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122}} The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission most of her navy. Goldsworthy states that the Carthaginian navy became inactive and considers it likely that few ships were kept in commission.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Certainly they withdrew most of their warships from Sicily.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the native [[Numidians]]. [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]] was put in charge of operations in Africa in 248 BC and went on to conquer considerable territory by 248 BC. The historian Nigel Bagnall considers that during this period Carthage viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|left|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nBy 248 BC, the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome had gained control of most of Sicily{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} and the Carthaginians retained only two cities on the island: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} \n\nWhen [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]] from his base at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\nEarly in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie 15\u201340 km (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements{{snd}}either 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sources{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}}{{snd}}and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=117}} The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]]; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by [[blockade runner]]s. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nBy 243 BC, after more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-[[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\n==New Roman fleet==\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the [[Roman Senate]] decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}}{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], assisted by the [[praetor]] [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=123\u2013124}} Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became [[proconsul]] and [[Promagistrate|propraetor]] respectively.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=152}}{{sfn|Smith|1870|pp=135, 138}}\n \nThe garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepana{{snd}}and Hamilcar's army at Eryx{{snd}}held fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Aegades241a.png|thumb|upright=1.35|{{center|The course of the battle}}|alt=A map showing the movements of both fleets during the battle]]\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]]; he is distinguished from the other Hanno's by being known as the son of Hannibal. This is possibly the general who had lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battles of Agrigentum]] and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=153}} The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a [[Following sea|following]] wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargoes, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade and took on board his 200 quinqueremes a full complement of marines from the soldiers of the besieging Roman army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa, {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} Hanno immediately set sail for Lilybaeum. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Hamilcar Barca and Lilybaeum. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}} Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}}\n[[File:Q.

Having little choice, the Carthaginians lowered their sails and engaged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=155}} \n\nIn the ensuing battle the Romans enjoyed far greater mobility, since their vessels were carrying only the bare necessities, while the Carthaginians were burdened with the equipment necessary for sustained travel and provisions for the Sicilian garrisons. The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar's soldiers.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=195\u2013196}} It was the second time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the {{lang|la|corvus}}{{snd}}the first time, at the Battle of Drepana, they were badly beaten{{snd}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=151}} but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships' greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. The Roman ships were a match for their opponents, modelled as they were on one of the best of the Carthaginians', and their crews were superior.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=156}} The Romans sank 50 Carthaginian ships, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with up to 10,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=271}} However, the battle was hard fought, with the Romans losing 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore to save weight and so were unable to pursue. The Carthaginian remnants returned to Carthage, where their unsuccessful commander was crucified.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:PICT0510 - Largo di Torre Argentina (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|{{center|Remains of the [[Temple of Juturna]] at [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], built by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] to celebrate his victory}}|alt=A photograph of Roman ruins in a modern street setting]]\n\nCatulus was granted a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] to celebrate his victory, while Falto was granted a separate and slightly junior triumph.{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=272}} To celebrate the victory, Catulus built a temple to [[Juturna]] in the [[Campus Martius]], in the area of Rome currently known as the [[Largo di Torre Argentina]]. Elements of this building survive to the present-day.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=609}}\n\nAfter achieving this decisive victory over the Carthaginian fleet, Catulus continued the land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum, Eryx and Drepana; which continued to be defended by Hamilcar Barca and his army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}} The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Carthage had taken nine months to fit out the fleet that was defeated, and if they took another nine months to ready another fleet, the Sicilian cities still holding out would run out of supplies and [[Suing for peace|request terms]]. Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nHenceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.

It took place among the [[Aegates Islands]], off the western coast of the island of [[Sicily]]. The Carthaginians were commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], and the Romans were under the overall authority of [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], but [[Quintus Valerius Falto]] commanded during the battle. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War.\n\nThe Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as [[marines]]. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet, which was further handicapped by being laden with supplies and having not yet embarked its full complement of marines.\n\nAs a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the [[Treaty of Lutatius]], by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial [[War reparations|reparations]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1998|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing.{{sfn|Royal|Tusa|2019|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n==Background==\n===Operations in Sicily===\n\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nIn 264 BC, the states of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]] went to war, starting the First Punic War.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=168}} Carthage was a well-established [[maritime power]] in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River [[Arno]] had recently been [[Roman expansion in Italy|unified under Roman control]]. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n===Ships===\n\nDuring this period the standard Mediterranean warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100 [[tonne]]s (110 [[short tons]]; 100 [[long tons]]). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested that they could maintain 7 [[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Average speeds of 5\u20136 knots (6\u20137 mph; 9\u201311 kph) were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=283}}\n\nVessels were built as cataphract, or \"protected\", ships, with a closed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}} The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets \u2013 or files \u2013 of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=101}}\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a [[trireme]]|{{center|Depiction of the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek trireme}}]]\n\nThe Romans had little prior naval experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] provided by their Latin or Greek allies.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=66}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=91\u201392, 97}}In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and thus slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], although [[hexareme]]s (six oarsmen per bank), [[quadriremes]] (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So [[wikt:ubiquitous|ubiquitous]] was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines;{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]], and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} Ideally one would attack an enemy ship from its side or rear, thus avoiding the possibility of being rammed oneself. Skill was required to impact an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one's own galley in the stricken enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship on ship combats which have been likened to aerial [[dogfight]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===264\u2013250 BC===\n\nLargely because of the Romans' invention of the {{lang|la|[[Corvus (boarding device)|corvus]]}}, a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at [[Battle of Mylae|Mylae]] (260 BC), [[Battle of Sulci|Sulci]] (257 BC), [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus|Ecnomus]] (256 BC) and [[Battle of Cape Hermaea|Cape Hermaeum]] (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the {{lang|la|corvus}} may have contributed to this disaster.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} In any event, they did not use the {{lang|la|corvus}} thereafter.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=86}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nThe Carthaginians regained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories over the blockading Roman fleet at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2011|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122}} The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission most of her navy. Goldsworthy states that the Carthaginian navy became inactive and considers it likely that few ships were kept in commission.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Certainly they withdrew most of their warships from Sicily.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the native [[Numidians]]. [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]] was put in charge of operations in Africa in 248 BC and went on to conquer considerable territory by 248 BC. The historian Nigel Bagnall considers that during this period Carthage viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:First Punic War Sicily 7 248-241BC.svg|thumb|upright=|left|{{center|Carthage's foothold in western Sicily, 248\u2013241 BC, in gold; Roman-controlled territory in pink; Syracusan in green}}|alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage]]\n\nBy 248 BC, the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome had gained control of most of Sicily{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} and the Carthaginians retained only two cities on the island: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} \n\nWhen [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]] from his base at [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\nEarly in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie 15\u201340 km (9\u201325 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcements{{snd}}either 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sources{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}}{{snd}}and a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=117}} The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]]; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by [[blockade runner]]s. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nBy 243 BC, after more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-[[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\n==New Roman fleet==\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the [[Roman Senate]] decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}}{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=66}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], assisted by the [[praetor]] [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=123\u2013124}} Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became [[proconsul]] and [[Promagistrate|propraetor]] respectively.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=152}}{{sfn|Smith|1870|pp=135, 138}}\n \nThe garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepana{{snd}}and Hamilcar's army at Eryx{{snd}}held fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Aegades241a.png|thumb|upright=1.35|{{center|The course of the battle}}|alt=A map showing the movements of both fleets during the battle]]\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]]; he is distinguished from the other Hanno's by being known as the son of Hannibal. This is possibly the general who had lost the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battles of Agrigentum]] and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=153}} The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a [[Following sea|following]] wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargoes, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade and took on board his 200 quinqueremes a full complement of marines from the soldiers of the besieging Roman army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa, {{convert|16|km|mi|sigfig=1}} from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} Hanno immediately set sail for Lilybaeum. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Hamilcar Barca and Lilybaeum. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}} Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=125}}\n[[File:Q.

The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar's soldiers.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=154\u2013155}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=195\u2013196}} It was the second time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the {{lang|la|corvus}}{{snd}}the first time, at the Battle of Drepana, they were badly beaten{{snd}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=151}} but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships' greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. The Roman ships were a match for their opponents, modelled as they were on one of the best of the Carthaginians', and their crews were superior.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=156}} The Romans sank 50 Carthaginian ships, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with up to 10,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}}{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=271}} However, the battle was hard fought, with the Romans losing 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore to save weight and so were unable to pursue. The Carthaginian remnants returned to Carthage, where their unsuccessful commander was crucified.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:PICT0510 - Largo di Torre Argentina (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|{{center|Remains of the [[Temple of Juturna]] at [[Largo di Torre Argentina]], built by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] to celebrate his victory}}|alt=A photograph of Roman ruins in a modern street setting]]\n\nCatulus was granted a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] to celebrate his victory, while Falto was granted a separate and slightly junior triumph.{{sfn|Dart|Vervaet|2011|p=272}} To celebrate the victory, Catulus built a temple to [[Juturna]] in the [[Campus Martius]], in the area of Rome currently known as the [[Largo di Torre Argentina]]. Elements of this building survive to the present-day.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=609}}\n\nAfter achieving this decisive victory over the Carthaginian fleet, Catulus continued the land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum, Eryx and Drepana; which continued to be defended by Hamilcar Barca and his army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}} The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Carthage had taken nine months to fit out the fleet that was defeated, and if they took another nine months to ready another fleet, the Sicilian cities still holding out would run out of supplies and [[Suing for peace|request terms]]. Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nHenceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole.

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Flintstones]]''\n|1960\u20131966\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstones episodes|166 episodes]]\n|6\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|4\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|5\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|6\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|8\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''[[The New Shmoo]]''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|11\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]''{{Efn|A 7-minute short cartoon featuring Dino originally aired as part of the animated showcase series ''[[What a Cartoon!]]''.}}\n|1995\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|1 episode\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|13\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

Another similar ad for the cigarettes featured Wilma and Betty as well; the women were working hard mowing the lawn and beating dust out of a rug while Fred and Barney smoked behind the house. Vignettes also aired in which Fred lit Wilma's Winston cigarette, and the couple shared a smoke.

Fred is the husband of [[Wilma Flintstone]] and father of [[Pebbles Flintstone]]. His best friend is his next door neighbor, [[Barney Rubble|Barney]], who has a wife named [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] and an adopted son, named [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]].<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=flintstones The Flintstones] ''[[The Museum of Broadcast Communications]]''</ref>\n\nFred lives in the fictional [[prehistoric]] town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]], a world where dinosaurs coexist with modernized [[caveman|cavepeople]] and the cavepeople enjoy \"primitive\" versions of [[modern conveniences]] such as [[telephone]]s, [[automobile]]s, and [[washing machine]]s. Fred's trademark catchphrase yell is \"yabba dabba doo!\", a phrase that was originally his club's cheer, and later adopted as part of the theme song from the third season on and used in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action ''Flintstones'' movie]].\n\nSince the original series' run, Fred has appeared in various other cartoon spinoffs, live action adaptations, music videos, and [[television commercial|commercial]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nWhile the mid-1980s [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' depicts Fred as a child, the series may be [[apocryphal]] due to its presenting Wilma as a childhood friend of Fred and Barney; the original series asserts that they first met as young adults.<ref name=\"bachelor\">\"Bachelor Daze,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 4</ref> Still, the series' depictions that Fred is the only child of Ed and Edna Flintstone (a handyman and a [[housewife|homemaker]], respectively) might be taken as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]. In the long-running Flintstones newspaper comic strip by [[Gene Hazelton]], Fred's father, '''Pops Flintstone''', was a recurring character.<ref>https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uixhK3mS6Yw/VwQXPSOzfBI/AAAAAAABj9A/ypZWn57gvkk750lJj5CtofFfQyRLU6Uag/s1600/Flintstones-1967-08-26.jpg</ref>\n\nAs young adults, Fred and Barney worked as bellhops at a resort. There, they meet and fall in love with Wilma and Betty, who were working there as [[cigarette girl]]s. Fred and Wilma's mother, [[Pearl Slaghoople]], also met and took an instant dislike to each other, starting a long-lasting rivalry between the two.<ref name=\"bachelor\"/> An unspecified amount of time later, Fred married Wilma.\n\nFred is a typical [[blue-collar worker]], who works as a \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] crane operator\" at Slate Rock and Gravel Company (also known as Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company in earlier episodes). Fred's job title in the second-season episode \"Divided We Sail\" is \"geological engineer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580165/|title=Divided We Sail|via=www.imdb.com|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the original series' third season, Wilma gives birth to the couple's daughter, Pebbles. Years later, when Pebbles is a teenager, Fred and Barney join the Bedrock [[police]] force for a time as part-time [[police officer]]s.<ref name=\"comedyshow\" /> Eventually, Fred becomes a [[grandfather]] to the adult Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's twins, Chip and Roxy. Fred's family grew again in ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'', when he and Wilma adopted an orphaned caveboy named Stony, and despite a rough start, Fred and his new son bonded well.\n\n==Relatives==\nThe Flintstone family's paternal side originally came from the prehistoric state of Arkanstone, where they had been engaged in a feud similar to the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]]. The feud was originally started by an ancestor of Fred's making a joke about a Hatrock family portrait (\"I don't know what the artist got for doing that painting, but he should've gotten life!\"). In the fourth-season episode \"Bedrock Hillbillies,\" the feud is ended when Fred helps rescue Pebbles and a Hatrock baby, only to start up again when Fred makes the same joke as his ancestor. The Hatrocks later appear in the follow-up fifth-season episode \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\", where they visit Bedrock. The last of the Arkanstone Flintstones was Fred's great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone who lived to 102.\n\nOther relatives of Fred include: Rockbottom \"Rocky/Stony\" Flintstone, Fred's grandfather, who was a veteran of Stone World War One;<ref name=\"raiders\" />; Uncle Giggles Flintstone, a rich, eccentric practical joker whose jokes drive Fred into a mad rage;<ref name=\"haunted\" /> James Hardrock, Edna's father; Uncle Tex Hardrock, Fred's rich Texan uncle;<ref name=\"tex\" /> Tumbleweed and Mary Lou Jim, Fred's rich Texan cousins;<ref name=\"droop\" />  .\n[[File:Jackie Gleason - 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Flintstones'' character was based on the character [[Ralph Kramden]] ([[Jackie Gleason]]) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'']]\n\n==Personality==\nFred's personality was based on that of [[Ralph Kramden]] of the 1950s television series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' and Chester A. Riley from ''[[The Life of Riley]]'', both of whom were originally portrayed on television by [[Jackie Gleason]] (Riley was originally portrayed on radio, film and later television episodes by [[William Bendix]]). Much like Ralph, Fred tends to be loud-mouthed, aggressive, and constantly scheming ways to improve his family's working class lot in life, often with unintended results. Also like Ralph, despite his harshness, he is friendly, and has a loving heart, who is very devoted to his family and cares a lot about his best friend and next door neighbor [[Barney Rubble]]. Fred loses his temper easily and is very impatient, but he seems free of malice and never holds a grudge. Although his loudness irritates the people around him, Fred proves friendly, often going out of his way to help others. Also, although Fred often annoys Wilma with his immaturity, he is known to go to great lengths to please his family and apologize when he goes too far. Other known characters from other programs may also be known to have personalities based on Fred Flintstone including [[Archie Bunker]] from ''[[All In The Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' (both played by [[Carroll OConnor]]), [[George Jefferson]] from ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (played by [[Sherman Hemsley]]), [[Mel Sharples]] from ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' (played by [[Vic Tayback]]) and Frank DeFazio from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' (played by [[Phil Foster]]).\n\nFred's interests include [[bowling]], playing [[Billiards|pool]], [[golf]], [[poker]] and lounging around the house. Fred has won championships with his bowling skills; in one episode, he goes so far as to take [[ballet]] lessons in order to improve his game.<ref>\"Bowling Ballet,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref> The nickname of \"Twinkletoes\" stuck with him when Fred attended a local university and became eligible to play on their football team, and it became his [[call sign]].<ref>\"Flintstone of Prinstone,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an excellent golfer. Fred is a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos Lodge (named \"the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs\" in an early episode).<ref name=\"hotlips\">\"Hot Lips Hannigan,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 1</ref> Fred also has a serious [[gambling problem]]; the mere mention of the word \"bet\" causes Fred to stammer \"bet\" over and over again (sounding like a clucking chicken) and go on gambling binges.<ref>\"The Gambler,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred is also an avid driver. In the fifth-season episode \"Indianrockolis 500,\" Fred entered the [[Indianapolis 500|famed prehistoric auto race]] under the [[pseudonym]] \"Goggles Paisano\".<ref>{{YouTube|GmQoWQb4tx0}}</ref>\n\nFred's [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba-Dabba-Doo!\"; [[Alan Reed]], voice actor who provided Fred's voice from 1960\u20131977, reportedly said that the inspiration for the phrase came from his mother, who used to say, \"A little dab'll do ya,\" probably borrowed from a Brylcreem commercial. When the script called for a simple 'Yahoo!' Alan either asked if he could alter the phrase or he ad-libbed. It inspired, in the 1970s a short-lived fruit drink called \"Yabba Dabba Dew\" and may or may not have also inspired [[George Jetson]]'s similar-sounding catchphrase, \"Hooba-dooba-dooba\" (or \"Hooba-Dooba\"). It does, however, become the subject of a song by [[Hoagy Carmichael]] that the singer-songwriter performs in an episode of ''The Flintstones''<ref>. In \"The Hit Song Writers,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 2</ref> Fred's ability to carry a tune was quite good in his younger years. One early episode<ref name=\"hotlips\" /> sees Fred (with Barney, who is a skilled [[drummer]]) perform at a nightclub with his musician friend \"Hot Lips Hannigan\" where his singing caused teenage girls to swoon over him; on this occasion, he was nicknamed \"the [[Mel Torme|Golden Smog]]\". In another first-season episode, \"Girls' Night Out\", Fred recorded a demo record at a [[carnival]] of the song \"[[Listen to the Mockingbird|Listen to the Rocking Bird]]\", which ended up making him a teenage singing idol named \"Hi Fye.\" As the series progressed, however, his voice became worse and worse (even during his success as a singer, Wilma was never impressed by Fred's voice), eventually to the point that a temporary maid the Flintstones hired quit rather than having to hear Fred sing.<ref>\"Wilma, the Maid,\" ''The Flintstones'', season 3</ref>\n\nDue to his impulsive and short-tempered behavior and stubborn and somewhat selfish nature, Fred seems to be accident-prone. Even his most innocent and mundane actions often cause widespread confusion. At the end of the closing credits, Fred begins to knock the door of his house and starts yelling \"Wilma\", to open the door.\n\nAccording to the original series' third-season episode \"The Birthday Party\" (originally aired April 5, 1963), Fred's birthday is February 2. Fred's address has varied through the series' run, with addresses given for the Flintstone residence including 345 Cave Stone Road, and 1313 Cobblestone Way. Fred's address was cited as \"55 Cobblestone Rd\" in the 1961 episode \"The X-Ray Story\".\n\n==Animated media==\n===Television shows===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Series number\n!style=\"width:250px;\"|Title\n!style=\"width:100px;\"|Broadcast run\n!style=\"width:150px;\"|Original channel\n!style=\"width:175px;\"|Total # episodes\n!style=\"width:30px;\"|Total # seasons\n|-\n|1\n|''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''\n|1971\u20131972\n|rowspan=\"3\" | [[CBS]]\n|16 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|2\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]''\n|1972\u20131973\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 18 episodes\n|-\n|3\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''{{Efn|A re-titled second season of reruns featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour''.}}\n|1973\u20131974\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|4\n|''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]''{{Efn|A 30-minute weekday animated series which aired in first-run syndication.}}\n|1977\u20131978\n|[[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n|95 episodes\n|1\n|-\n|5\n|''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1979\n|rowspan=\"5\" | [[NBC]]\n|17 episodes\n|2\n|-\n|6\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]''\n|13 episodes\n|rowspan=\"2\" | 1\n|-\n|7\n|''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' {{Efn|This 90-minute series featured reruns of ''Fred and Barney Meet the Thing'' combined with episodes of ''[[The New Shmoo]]''.}}\n|1979\u20131980\n|17 episodes\n|-\n|8\n|''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''\n|1980\u20131982\n|18 episodes\n|rowspan=\"3\" | 2\n|-\n|9\n|''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]''{{Efn|A compilation series featuring repackaged segments from ''The Flintstone Comedy Show''.}}\n|1982\u20131984\n|26 episodes\n|-\n|10\n|''[[The Flintstone Kids]]''\n|1986\u20131988\n|[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\n|[[List of The Flintstone Kids episodes|34 episodes]]\n|-\n|11\n|''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]''{{Efn|A 7-minute short cartoon featuring Dino originally aired as part of the animated showcase series ''[[What a Cartoon!]]''.}}\n|1995\n|[[Cartoon Network]]\n|1 episode\n|style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\"|\n|-\n|12\n|''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''\n|2020<!-- Do NOT link this title to \"Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!

Another similar ad for the cigarettes featured Wilma and Betty as well; the women were working hard mowing the lawn and beating dust out of a rug while Fred and Barney smoked behind the house. Vignettes also aired in which Fred lit Wilma's Winston cigarette, and the couple shared a smoke. By the original series' third season, Winston had been dropped as a sponsor in favor of [[Welch's]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2012/12/09/did-the-flintstones-do-commercials-for-winston-cigarettes/|title=Did the Flintstones Do Commercials for Winston Cigarettes?|date=2012-12-09|accessdate=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Flintstones Chewable Vitamins]]\n*[[Pebbles Cereal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Yabba Dabba Doo!

It was set inside the fictional Survival [[Gym]] in [[New York City]], and was a [[parody]] of [[prime time]] [[soap opera]]s of the 1990s (with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[Melrose Place]]'' being the most noticeable inspiration). The series was created by [[Rob LaZebnik]], and was executive produced by [[Paul Junger Witt]], [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]] and Gary S. Levine.\n\n''Muscle'' was one of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday night two-hour WB lineup, at 9:30/8:30c (with ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', ''[[The Parent 'Hood]]'', and ''[[Unhappily Ever After]]'' being scheduled before it). It was the only one of the four that did not make it past the first season, and was also the first series to get canceled on the brand new WB.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/09/17/the-five-wb-shows-that-we-forgot/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009094132/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/09/17/the-five-wb-shows-that-we-forgot/|title=The Five: WB shows that we forgot|archive-date=2007-08-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> Like its inspiration, ABC's ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' from the 1970s, it ended on an unresolved cliffhanger after being canceled due to low ratings.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe central plot concerned the murder of \"Big\" Jim Atkinson ([[Adam West]]), the president and founder of the chain of gyms, by poisoning in the first episode.  His son Kent, a former [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and [[addiction|drug addict]], was determined to figure out who the killer was and bring him or her to justice.  His original suspect was his stepmother and the new president of the company, Jane Atkinson.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Dan Gauthier]] as Kent Atkinson, was the son of the founder of Survivor Gyms, Jim Atkinson. The two of them had a contentious relationship fueled by the fact that Kent never felt that his father thought he was good enough. This may have contributed to his various acts of rebellion against his father, such as his alcoholism, drug abuse and frequent womanizing.\n\n:In an ultimate act of rebellion he would sleep with his father's [[trophy wife]], Jane, inside the gym's sauna. When Big Jim caught them in the act he apparently died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], but an [[autopsy]] would reveal that he was in fact poisoned. Kent would then spend the rest of the series trying to bring his father's murderer to justice, by doing his own amateur investigation. His initial suspect was his step mother Jane, but he would also come to suspect his best friend, and gym manager, Victor.\n\n*[[Shannon Kenny]] as Jane Atkinson, was Big Jim Atkinson's beautiful, [[United Kingdom|British]], and much younger, wife (she was about the same age as his son). She was portrayed throughout the series as being very [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and was the series principal villain. Her character can in part be seen as a parody of [[Joan Collins]]' character, Alexis, on the television series ''Dynasty''.\n\n:After the death of her husband she tried to take over running the Survival Gym. However her stepson, Kent, remained a constant rival for the job. In order to win him over she set about seducing him and making him her second husband. Kent, however, believed she had murdered his father and was initially reluctant. After Big Jim's secretary confessed to the murder, it appeared that Jane and Kent would begin to have a relationship.  Unbeknownst to Kent, Jane paid the secretary to confess.\n\n:Another scheme she had to secure the Survival Gym franchise was to become pregnant with Big Jim's child, using his previously frozen sperm. However, Jane discovered that she was in fact barren, and had to ask Cleo, to be a surrogate.\n  \n*[[Amy Pietz]] as Bronwyn Jones, was Kent's cousin, and a local television news anchor. At the start of the series she was a closeted [[lesbian]], Robert Bingham would try and blackmail her in order to keep her secret. Bronwyn would respond by outing herself at the end of one of her own news casts. This would cause the news director to exploit this fact. For example, he designed a news promo about problems in health care as: \"Naughty Nurses\" featuring two beautiful women in nursing outfits having a pillow fight. Then the announcer would say the local news channel's name, \"...featuring Bronwyn Jones, lesbian!\" By the series end Bronwyn was considering leaving the broadcast to escape exploitation.\n*[[Wendy Benson]] as Cleo, was a trainer and struggling actress working at the gym. Seen primarily as innocent and naive by her fellow gym staffers, she was in fact a woman with a mysterious past. This would be hinted at by the fact that she sometimes would speak with a Southern accent when she was alone. She routinely received phone calls from a mysterious woman, also with a Southern accent, who called her Lorna Louise.\n\n:It was later revealed that the mysterious woman was in fact her mother. Her mother was a madam at a [[brothel]]. She did not know who her real father was, only that she was conceived around the time the [[circus]] was in town. Cleo/Lorna Louise believed that her father was a [[clown]], she never met him during the show.\n\n:The staff and clientele at Survival Gym never knew this and Cleo was often used as a pawn in the power struggles between Jane and Kent Atkinson. For example, Jane asked her to be a [[surrogate mother]] for Big Jim's baby, in an attempt to control Survival Gym. When Kent found out, he seduced Cleo, and then asked her not to agree to be the surrogate. What he did not know, was Cleo had already had the procedure. When Cleo actually ended up being pregnant she did not know who her baby's father was, Kent, or Big Jim, but believed whoever it was she would end up inheriting a huge fortune from the Atkinson family. However, she had also had sex with a director to get in his play, so there was a possibility that he was the father of her baby. The series ended without the father being revealed.\n\n*[[Michael Boatman]] as Garnet Hines, was a successful criminal defense attorney. He was portrayed as being amoral and doing whatever it takes to get his client acquitted. One of Garnet's past clients was Robert Bingham, who he failed to get acquitted, but did get him a light prison term.\n\n:Garnet Hines's most infamous client was Guy Davore, the Carnivore. Guy was accused of being a [[serial killer]] and a [[cannibal]]. Garnet with the help of Dr. Gold would get Guy acquitted, however both men would come to regret this action.\n \n*[[Nestor Carbonell]] as Gianni was a [[gigolo]], who used the gym to meet potential \"dates\". Gianni grew up poor and was determined never to be poor again. Believing that he had few talents, he decided the only way he could live a life of luxury was living off of women. The woman who he would become involved with was a wealthy widow named Dottie.\n\n:Gianni's other love interest was a trainer, named Angela, who had a crush on him. Although there was some chemistry between them, her lack of monetary success, initially led him to reject her. However, he would eventually dump the financially secure Dottie, for a romantic relationship with Angela. Ironically, shortly after choosing Angela, Gianni suffered a back injury that temporarily paralyzed him and caused him to be supported by Angela's limited finances.\n  \n*Steve Henneberry (best known as Tower from [[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]) as Sam Pippin, was a sweet, but not too bright and insecure [[bodybuilder]], and trainer at the gym. Sam had a crush on Bronwyn, when he did not initially know she was a lesbian. His business partner Robert Bingham blackmailed Bronwyn, into going on a date with Sam in order to build up Sam's confidence. After Bronwyn came out, Sam attempted suicide by throwing himself off the Gym's roof, but Robert talked him down.\n*[[Jerry Levine]] as Robert/Roberta Bingham, was a former stockbroker on Wall Street, who was convicted of insider trading. At the start of the show he was just released from prison and on parole. While on parole he had been given an ankle monitor, which limited how far he could move inside the gym.\n\n:Robert had initially hired Sam to be his trainer. Robert soon came up with a plan to have Sam star in a series of exercise videos. Robert would do anything to help Sam, from blackmailing Bronwyn to date Sam, to providing him with steroids to help him win a bodybuilding contest. Despite doing these unscrupulous acts, he also showed genuine compassion towards Sam, like talking him out of committing suicide even though it violated Robert's parole (Sam tried to kill himself outside of Robert's ankle bracelet's range). Given that he had a good reason, Robert's parole was not violated.\n\n:Because he tried to blackmail her, Bronwyn had a strong dislike for Robert. This was initially mutual due to the fact he found her to be arrogant. However in a strange twist, he developed a crush on her. Since she was a lesbian, he decided to dress in drag as Roberta to Angela and Gianni's wedding to win her over. Bronwyn apparently was attracted to \"Roberta\", however the series was not renewed and this plot element was never fully developed.\n  \n*[[Alan Ruck]] as Dr. Marshall Gold, a [[psychiatrist]] who worked out at the gym. Marshall was notorious for constantly revealing things told to him in the confidence of his practice. He was the one who told Robert that Bronwyn was a lesbian. Dr. Gold admitted that if he was bored listening to a patient, he would reread some of the details about Bronwyn's sex life.\n\n:Marshall was also the expert witness in the Guy Davore case. It was his testimony that Guy was sane that led, in part, to Guy's acquittal. Dr. Gold would later come to regret this.\n  \n*T.E. Russell as Victor, was the manager of the New York branch of Survival Gym and Kent's best friend. Victor was often poorly treated by Big Jim and thus became a suspect in his murder. Victor's friendship with Kent came into question when Kent told the police that Victor was probably the killer. After Big Jim's secretary confessed, Victor would refuse to be friends with Kent because he had suspected him of the murder.\n*[[Michole White]] as Angela, was a trainer at the gym who had a crush on Gianni. Her parents ran a pet store specializing in [[birds]] and [[fish]]. While they did not have much money, they did love each other deeply. This is what Angela wanted, someone she could share a romantic relationship with.\n\n:Gianni, being a gigolo, initially resisted being with her because of her lack of money, however, he realized he did in fact love her. After a brief courtship he would propose marriage. The final episode of the series was Angela and Gianni's wedding at the gym, the place where they met.\n\n=== Notable guest stars ===  \n*[[Adam West]] as \"Big\" Jim Atkinson, was the founder and president of the Survival Gym chain. Big Jim was seen occasionally in flashbacks and heard in voice-overs, after his death in the first episodes. Big Jim was portrayed as sort of a macho, self-promoting business man. He was constantly challenging people to feats of strength contests.\n\n== Episodes ==\n#Pilot (January 11, 1995)\n#Episode 2 (January 11, 1995)\n#Episode 3 (January 18, 1995)\n#Episode 4 (January 25, 1995)\n#Episode 5 (February 1, 1995)\n#Episode 6 (February 8, 1995)\n#Episode 7 (February 15, 1995)\n#Episode 8 (February 22, 1995)\n#Episode 9 (March 1, 1995)\n#Episode 10 (April 26, 1995)\n#Episode 11 (May 10, 1995)\n#Episode 12 (May 17, 1995)\n#Episode 13 (May 24, 1995)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0112087|title=Muscle}}\n* {{tv.com show|muscle|Muscle}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1995 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1995 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

I have to give Mama credit\u2014she refused to give us up\u2026 So I became the supporter of the family, and I had to take my father\u2019s place in many, many ways. I was expected to make up for everything that had ever gone wrong in Mama\u2019s life.

The film became a cult success.\n\nAround this time, Weld became famous for turning down roles in films that succeeded at the box office, such as ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'', ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', and ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]''.<ref name=\"louis jordan\">{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Louis |title=The Real Tuesday Weld |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/the-real-tuesday-weld |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=20 September 2011}}</ref> In a 1971 interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'', Weld explained that she had chosen to reject these roles precisely because she believed they would be commercial successes: \"Do you think I want a success? I refused 'Bonnie and Clyde' because I was nursing at the time, but also because deep down I knew it was going to be a huge success. The same was true of 'Bob and Carol and Fred and Sue' or whatever it was called. It reeked of success\".<ref name=\"louis jordan\" />\n\nThe films Weld did make included ''[[I Walk the Line (film)|I Walk the Line]]'' (1970), opposite [[Gregory Peck]]; ''[[A Safe Place]]'' (1971), co-starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Orson Welles]] and directed by [[Henry Jaglom]], and ''[[Play It as It Lays (film)|Play It as It Lays]]'' (1972), again with Perkins, for which she was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]].<ref name=\"brat\">Haber, J.

During the robbery, her character goads [[Robert De Niro]]'s character, [[David \"Noodles\" Aaronson]], into \"raping\" her with her complicity.\n\nOn TV, Weld was in ''[[Scorned and Swindled]]'' (1984), ''[[Circle of Violence: A Family Drama|Circle of Violence]]'' (1986) and ''Something in Common'' (1986). She had a supporting role in ''[[Heartbreak Hotel (film)|Heartbreak Hotel]]'' (1988).\n\n===Later career===\nWeld was reunited with [[Anthony Perkins]] in an episode of ''Mistress of Suspense'' (1990).\n\nIn 1993 she played a police officer's [[neurosis|neurotic]] wife  in ''[[Falling Down]]'', starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Robert Duvall]].

When the genus ''Metasequoia'' was first described in 1941, it was from [[Mesozoic Era]] fossils, none of which were less than 150 million years old. While studying fossil samples of the family [[Cupressaceae]], Dr. Shigeru Miki from [[Kyoto University]] identified a divergent leaf form. He realized he had discovered a new genus, which he named ''Metasequoia'', meaning \"like a sequoia\".\n\nIn the same year, Kan Duo (Toh Kan, 1903-1961), professor of Forest Management, National Central University, [[Chongqing]], (formerly Chungking) observed an enormous living specimen while performing a survey in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. Though unaware of Miki's new genus, he recognized the unique traits of the tree. Unfortunately, while he collected some plant material, he did not attempt to identify or publish his findings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Jinshuang|date=June 2003|title=The Chronology of the \"Living Fossil\" Metasequoia glyptostroboides (Taxodiaceae): A Review (1943-2003)|url=|journal=Harvard Papers in Botany|volume=8|issue=1|pages=10|via=}}</ref> This tree formed part of a local shrine, where villagers called it ''Shui-shan'' {{link text|\u6c34\u6749}} or \"water fir\".<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bruce |last1=Bartholomew |first2=David E. |last2=Boufford |first3=Stephen A. |last3=Spongberg |date=January 1983 |title=Metasequoia glyptostroboides\u2014Its present status in central China |journal=Journal of the Arnold Arboretum |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=105\u201328 |jstor=43782567 |doi=10.5962/bhl.part.27404 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>This [[hanzi]] for \"fir\" is the same as the [[kanji]] for another species, ''[[Cryptomeria]] japonica'', that is, ''sugi'', Japanese cedar.

Such a forest would have been similar to [[bald cypress]] forests in the United States, with many similar species growing in association. Nearly 3,000 trunks were found in the floor of the valley, ranging from 2 meters (6.5 feet) to 8 meters (26 feet) wide at the base. Additionally, houses made of Metasequoia wood 200\u2013300 years old still exist and probably date back to the original settlement of the valley.<ref name=\"arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\"/><ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/>\n\nSince its discovery, the dawn redwood has become something of a national point of pride, and it is protected under Chinese law and also planted widely.<ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\" /> However, it is still listed as endangered in the wild.<ref name=\"IUCN\"/> Cutting of trees or branches is illegal, but the demand for seedlings drives cone collection to the point that natural reproduction is no longer occurring in the dawn redwood forest.<ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\" /> In addition, the landscape has been highly modified by human use, and a 1980 expedition found that the habitat has significantly degraded since the tree's discovery. Most of the other vegetation has been cut, and most of the area is no longer suitable ground for seedlings.<ref name=\"conifers.org\"/> Between 1950 and 1980 several hundred were logged in Metasequoia Valley, some over 2 meters (6.5 feet) wide.<ref name=\"conifers.org\"/><ref name=\"arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\"/>\n\nA survey in the 2000s counted and measured all wild dawn redwoods. The remaining healthy trees range from 25 cm (10 in) to 1.65 m (5.4 ft) wide at breast height, 12\u201351 m (39.5-167.5 ft) in height, and estimated 41\u2013265 years in age. The average size was 27 m (88.5 ft) tall and 0.45\u20130.9 m (1.5-3 ft) wide at breast height, with an estimated age of about 95 years. (The type tree, 2.48 m (8 ft) at breast height, was in poor health and therefore excluded from the study) No seedlings were found, and if they ever do appear it is legal to remove and transplant them.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/> The species will continue to live in yards, parks and on roadsides all over China, but the ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' forest ecosystem could disappear when its mature trees die.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\" />\n\n==Cultivation==\nSince the tree's rediscovery, the dawn redwood has become a popular [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]] in parks and gardens worldwide.\n\nDawn redwood seed arrived at the [[Arnold Arboretum]] on January 5, 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and was shipped to [[arboreta]] around the world soon after. By 1951, the species had entered the commercial horticultural trade in the US,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and following media excitement about the new discovery, including in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' of March 25 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> sales soon took off.\n\nDawn redwood has proved an easy tree to grow in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions, and is now widely planted as an [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]]. Planted trees have already reached at least up to 1.84 meters (6 feet) in diameter at breast height and 41.15 meters (135 feet) tall, despite being in cultivation for only 70 years. This rapid rate of growth has led to consideration for using the tree in [[forestry]] [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. It has been discovered that ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' will thrive in standing water, much like [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]], and if left branched to the ground in full sun, will develop the large, contorted [[Trunk (botany)|boles]] that have made it famous. Limbing or pruning at an early age will prohibit this formation later on.\n\nIn cultivation, ''M. glyptostroboides'' is hardy to [[USDA Hardiness Zone|USDA Zone 5]], making it hardy down to lows of \u221225&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221232&nbsp;\u00b0C). It is tolerant of soggy, waterlogged soils; in the wild it is adapted to growing on flood plains. Until it is established in a specific site, it is prone to drought and inadequate water availability. The dawn redwood is recommended for urban areas in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast of North America, as its fast growth rate and tolerance for air pollution make it widely adaptable and able to thrive where other species might suffer. This species tends to struggle without irrigation in arid climates such as the American West unless planted directly on or adjacent to a body of water such as a pond or stream. This species is also highly susceptible to damage from contact with heavy amounts of winter de-icing salt.<ref>Dirr, M.A. 1998. ''Manual of Woody Landscape Plants''. Stipes Publishing Co., Champaign, IL. (1453 p.)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, it was discovered that many of the second-generation trees in cultivation suffered from [[inbreeding depression]] (extremely low genetic variability), which could lead to increased susceptibility to disease and reproductive failure. Many sources claim that the original 1947 seedlots came from as few as one tree; however, this has proven to be false. The original seeds did have a wide range of source trees, and the inbreeding depression is more likely to come from self-pollination by isolated trees. However, the total cultivated population still had less genetic variation than the wild ones, and more widespread seed-collecting expeditions in China in the 1990s sought to resolve this problem and restore genetic diversity to cultivated ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Payton|first=Greg|date=2010|title=Conserving the Dawn Redwood: The Ex Situ Collection at the Dawes Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=68|issue=1|pages=26\u201333|via=|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609152024/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===In China===\n[[Pizhou]], [[Jiangsu]] has the longest dawn redwood avenue in the world.

When the genus ''Metasequoia'' was first described in 1941, it was from [[Mesozoic Era]] fossils, none of which were less than 150 million years old. While studying fossil samples of the family [[Cupressaceae]], Dr. Shigeru Miki from [[Kyoto University]] identified a divergent leaf form. He realized he had discovered a new genus, which he named ''Metasequoia'', meaning \"like a sequoia\".\n\nIn the same year, Kan Duo (Toh Kan, 1903-1961), professor of Forest Management, National Central University, [[Chongqing]], (formerly Chungking) observed an enormous living specimen while performing a survey in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. Though unaware of Miki's new genus, he recognized the unique traits of the tree. Unfortunately, while he collected some plant material, he did not attempt to identify or publish his findings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Jinshuang|date=June 2003|title=The Chronology of the \"Living Fossil\" Metasequoia glyptostroboides (Taxodiaceae): A Review (1943-2003)|url=|journal=Harvard Papers in Botany|volume=8|issue=1|pages=10|via=}}</ref> This tree formed part of a local shrine, where villagers called it ''Shui-shan'' {{link text|\u6c34\u6749}} or \"water fir\".<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bruce |last1=Bartholomew |first2=David E. |last2=Boufford |first3=Stephen A. |last3=Spongberg |date=January 1983 |title=Metasequoia glyptostroboides\u2014Its present status in central China |journal=Journal of the Arnold Arboretum |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=105\u201328 |jstor=43782567 |doi=10.5962/bhl.part.27404 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>This [[hanzi]] for \"fir\" is the same as the [[kanji]] for another species, ''[[Cryptomeria]] japonica'', that is, ''sugi'', Japanese cedar.

The other Sequoioideae and several other genera have been transferred from the [[Taxodiaceae]] to the Cupressaceae based on [[DNA sequencing|DNA analysis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gadek|first=P.A.|last2=Alpers|first2=D.L.|last3=Heslewood|first3=M.M.|last4=Quinn|first4=C.J.|date=2000|title=Relationships within Cupressaceae sensu lato: A combined morphological and molecular approach|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=87|issue=7|pages=1044\u20131057|doi=10.2307/2657004|jstor=2657004}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nStudies carried out between 2007 and 2009 counted 5,371 trees primarily in [[Lichuan, Hubei|Lichuan]], [[Hubei]]<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/><ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=Fall 1999|title=Revisiting the Dawn Redwoods|url=https://www.savetheredwoods.org/wp-content/uploads/bulletin_fa99.pdf|journal=Save-the-Redwoods League Bulletin|volume=|pages=8|access-date=4 October 2019|via=}}</ref><ref name=langlois2005>{{Cite book\n|contribution=A conservation plan for ''Metasequoia'' in China\n|first=Gaytha A. |last=Langlois\n|editor-first=Ben A. |editor-last=LePage|editor2-first= Christopher James |editor2-last=Williams|editor3-first= Hong |editor3-last=Yang\n|publisher=Springer |year=2005\n|isbn=1-4020-2631-5\n|title=The geobiology and ecology of Metasequoia\n|series=Volume 22 of Topics in geobiology\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JfiWU-1GSqEC&pg=PA369\n|page=369}}</ref>, with much smaller groups in Shizhu, [[Chonqing]] and Longshan, [[Hunan]].<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/>\n\nThe floodplain of Metasequoia Valley in Hubei had already been turned to rice paddies by the time of the tree's discovery, but was once probably a more extensive dawn redwood forest. Such a forest would have been similar to [[bald cypress]] forests in the United States, with many similar species growing in association. Nearly 3,000 trunks were found in the floor of the valley, ranging from 2 meters (6.5 feet) to 8 meters (26 feet) wide at the base. Additionally, houses made of Metasequoia wood 200\u2013300 years old still exist and probably date back to the original settlement of the valley.<ref name=\"arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\"/><ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/>\n\nSince its discovery, the dawn redwood has become something of a national point of pride, and it is protected under Chinese law and also planted widely.<ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\" /> However, it is still listed as endangered in the wild.<ref name=\"IUCN\"/> Cutting of trees or branches is illegal, but the demand for seedlings drives cone collection to the point that natural reproduction is no longer occurring in the dawn redwood forest.<ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\" /> In addition, the landscape has been highly modified by human use, and a 1980 expedition found that the habitat has significantly degraded since the tree's discovery. Most of the other vegetation has been cut, and most of the area is no longer suitable ground for seedlings.<ref name=\"conifers.org\"/> Between 1950 and 1980 several hundred were logged in Metasequoia Valley, some over 2 meters (6.5 feet) wide.<ref name=\"conifers.org\"/><ref name=\"arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\"/>\n\nA survey in the 2000s counted and measured all wild dawn redwoods. The remaining healthy trees range from 25 cm (10 in) to 1.65 m (5.4 ft) wide at breast height, 12\u201351 m (39.5-167.5 ft) in height, and estimated 41\u2013265 years in age. The average size was 27 m (88.5 ft) tall and 0.45\u20130.9 m (1.5-3 ft) wide at breast height, with an estimated age of about 95 years. (The type tree, 2.48 m (8 ft) at breast height, was in poor health and therefore excluded from the study) No seedlings were found, and if they ever do appear it is legal to remove and transplant them.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/> The species will continue to live in yards, parks and on roadsides all over China, but the ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' forest ecosystem could disappear when its mature trees die.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\" />\n\n==Cultivation==\nSince the tree's rediscovery, the dawn redwood has become a popular [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]] in parks and gardens worldwide.\n\nDawn redwood seed arrived at the [[Arnold Arboretum]] on January 5, 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and was shipped to [[arboreta]] around the world soon after. By 1951, the species had entered the commercial horticultural trade in the US,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and following media excitement about the new discovery, including in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' of March 25 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> sales soon took off.\n\nDawn redwood has proved an easy tree to grow in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions, and is now widely planted as an [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]]. Planted trees have already reached at least up to 1.84 meters (6 feet) in diameter at breast height and 41.15 meters (135 feet) tall, despite being in cultivation for only 70 years. This rapid rate of growth has led to consideration for using the tree in [[forestry]] [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. It has been discovered that ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' will thrive in standing water, much like [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]], and if left branched to the ground in full sun, will develop the large, contorted [[Trunk (botany)|boles]] that have made it famous. Limbing or pruning at an early age will prohibit this formation later on.\n\nIn cultivation, ''M. glyptostroboides'' is hardy to [[USDA Hardiness Zone|USDA Zone 5]], making it hardy down to lows of \u221225&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221232&nbsp;\u00b0C). It is tolerant of soggy, waterlogged soils; in the wild it is adapted to growing on flood plains. Until it is established in a specific site, it is prone to drought and inadequate water availability. The dawn redwood is recommended for urban areas in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast of North America, as its fast growth rate and tolerance for air pollution make it widely adaptable and able to thrive where other species might suffer. This species tends to struggle without irrigation in arid climates such as the American West unless planted directly on or adjacent to a body of water such as a pond or stream. This species is also highly susceptible to damage from contact with heavy amounts of winter de-icing salt.<ref>Dirr, M.A. 1998. ''Manual of Woody Landscape Plants''. Stipes Publishing Co., Champaign, IL. (1453 p.)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, it was discovered that many of the second-generation trees in cultivation suffered from [[inbreeding depression]] (extremely low genetic variability), which could lead to increased susceptibility to disease and reproductive failure. Many sources claim that the original 1947 seedlots came from as few as one tree; however, this has proven to be false. The original seeds did have a wide range of source trees, and the inbreeding depression is more likely to come from self-pollination by isolated trees. However, the total cultivated population still had less genetic variation than the wild ones, and more widespread seed-collecting expeditions in China in the 1990s sought to resolve this problem and restore genetic diversity to cultivated ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Payton|first=Greg|date=2010|title=Conserving the Dawn Redwood: The Ex Situ Collection at the Dawes Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=68|issue=1|pages=26\u201333|via=|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609152024/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===In China===\n[[Pizhou]], [[Jiangsu]] has the longest dawn redwood avenue in the world.

The first dawn redwood to be planted out in the UK was at the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]]. The seed was not from the Arnold expedition, but came to Cambridge directly. The Botanic Garden\u2019s Annual Report for 1949 declares: \u2018Seeds of Metasequoia glyptostroboides, sent by Dr Silow from China to [[Frederick Tom Brooks|Professor F T Brooks]], germinated freely. Three of the seedlings have been planted out: one in the Yard at the back of the Range and two beside the Pond (now called the Lake).'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/the-garden/gardens-plantings/trees/dawn-redwood/|title=Dawn Redwood|date=2019|website=Cambridge University Botanic Garden|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref> The tree on the south-west side of the Lake is still living, as at July 2019.
