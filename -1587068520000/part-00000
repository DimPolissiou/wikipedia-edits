One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> Conway's initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Block-laying_switch_engine|title=Block-laying switch engine|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The third configuration creates two such patterns.

Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.\n\nIt is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>\n\n==Undecidability==\n\nMany patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini \u2013 LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman\u2013Greene construction arms.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated subpatterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases, the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array, in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 |hdl=2299/6834 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

The vast majority of these 2<sup>18</sup> different rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like#Life-like_cellular_automata |title=Life-like cellular automata - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behavior. A further generalization produces the ''isotropic'' rulespace, with 2<sup>102</sup> possible CA rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Isotropic |title=Isotropic - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> (Conway's Life again being one of them). These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>\n\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_q.htm#quadlife |title=QuadLife |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> Conway's initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]].

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single ''block-laying switch engine'': a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as its translates itself across the game's universe.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Block-laying_switch_engine|title=Block-laying switch engine|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The third configuration creates two such patterns.

Silver|publisher=The Life Lexicon|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an [[Asymptotically optimal algorithm|asymptotically optimal]] [[quadratic growth|quadratic growth rate]], called a ''[[Breeder (cellular automaton)|breeder]]'' or ''lobster'', which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.\n\nIt is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.<ref>[http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Elementary \"Elementary\"], LifeWiki, retrieved 2018-11-21</ref>\n\n==Undecidability==\n\nMany patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini \u2013 LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman\u2013Greene construction arms.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 |hdl=2299/6834 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>\n\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A. Silver |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> Another similar variation, called ''QuadLife'', involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes on the fourth value, and otherwise, like ''Immigration'', it takes the majority value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_q.htm#quadlife |title=QuadLife |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a [[Go (game)|Go]] board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors. While Conway was investigating the R-pentomino, John Francis, an undergraduate student at The [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a program (for an [[IBM System/360]] mainframe at the nearby Institute of Theoretical Astronomy) to check Conway's results. This program showed that the configuration had not reached a stable state after 1,000 generations.\n\nThe first interactive ''Life'' program was written in an early version of [[ALGOL 68C]] for the [[PDP-7]] by [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|M.

She co-wrote the song with [[Max Martin]], [[Bonnie McKee]], and its producers [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]]. It was specifically written for Perry's autobiographical film ''[[Katy Perry: Part of Me]]''. [[Capitol Records]] released the song onto radio stations on May 22, 2012. The track is a power ballad styled in [[dance-pop]], and features lyrics about the reality of a break up and moving forward.\n\n\"Wide Awake\" became another commercial success for Perry, topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand while reaching number two in Lebanon and the United States. In America, the song was kept off the top spot by [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s \"[[Call Me Maybe]]\". It also peaked within the top 10 in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 20 in Brazil, Italy, and Slovakia. The single's music video was directed by Lance Drake, and featured a fairy tale-like story, starring Perry and a child version of her.

She then takes off her wig, looks into the mirror, and the setting turns to a dark [[labyrinth]], with Perry holding a lantern. The camera pans up to show the entire labyrinth, while also revealing a hill with light shining through the clouds onto it. Perry sees a strawberry, picks it off and eats it, and the walls close in on her. Perry pushes the walls, as a firework shoots from her chest into the dark sky. A door opens to reveal a younger version of Perry, and their hands touch. The two reach a mirror in which the younger Perry does not have a reflection, and [[paparazzi]] taking pictures (one of whom is dressed as [[Freddy Krueger]]) are seen behind the mirror. The floor begins to crumble as Perry finally shatters the mirror and the shards of the glass become butterflies.\n\nThe little girl is then seen pushing a wheelchair in which Perry sits in a hospital gown, trembling with the poisoned strawberry in one hand. In the hallway, they are met by two [[minotaur]] guards who block their way. The little girl furiously goes up to them and stomps her foot, sending the minotaurs flying. Perry gets up from the wheelchair, grabbing the little girl's hand as they run down the hallway to the exit. The doors open to reveal a garden. A man dressed as [[Prince Charming]] appears riding a [[unicorn]], and walks to Perry with [[Crossed fingers|fingers crossed]] behind his back. Perry punches him in the face, sending him through the fence. Perry and the girl find a heart-shaped exit, and the two girls [[high-five]]. They hug each other before the little girl places something in Perry's closed fist. The little girl rides away into a suburban neighborhood on a bike with a [[license plate]] reading \"Katheryn\", which is Katy's birth name. Perry returns to her dressing room and opens her fist, revealing a butterfly. The camera pans to a concert stage where Perry stands on a rising platform, and sings the beginning bars of \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\" to a full audience as the butterfly flies into the arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1687787/katy-perry-wide-awake-scenes/|title=Katy Perry's 'Wide Awake' Video: Five Key Scenes|first=James|last=Montgomery|website=MTV News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Katy Perry Uses New Video For 'Wide Awake' To Slam Russell Brand|url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/06/19/katy-perry-wide-awake-music-video-russell-brand/|date=19 Jun 2012|author=Bonnie Fuller}}</ref>\n\n===Release and reception===\nThe video was supposed to have its world premiere on June 19, 2012.

She co-wrote the song with [[Max Martin]], [[Bonnie McKee]], and its producers [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]]. It was specifically written for Perry's autobiographical film ''[[Katy Perry: Part of Me]]''. [[Capitol Records]] released the song onto radio stations on May 22, 2012. The track is a power ballad styled in [[dance-pop]], and features lyrics about the reality of a break up and moving forward.\n\n\"Wide Awake\" became another commercial success for Perry, topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand while reaching number two in Lebanon and the United States. In America, the song was kept off the top spot by [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s \"[[Call Me Maybe]]\". It also peaked within the top 10 in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and the United Kingdom as well as the top 20 in Brazil, Italy, and Slovakia. The single's music video was directed by Lance Drake, and featured a fairy tale-like story, starring Perry and a child version of her. The video also makes references from Perry's ''Teenage Dream'' singles and the previous ''Complete Confection'' single \"[[Part of Me (Katy Perry song)|Part of Me]]\".\n\n==Background and release==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = This song in particular is a dose of reality.

She then takes off her wig, looks into the mirror, and the setting turns to a dark [[labyrinth]], with Perry holding a lantern. The camera pans up to show the entire labyrinth, while also revealing a hill with light shining through the clouds onto it. Perry sees a strawberry, picks it off and eats it, and the walls close in on her. Perry pushes the walls, as a firework shoots from her chest into the dark sky. A door opens to reveal a younger version of Perry, and their hands touch. The two reach a mirror in which the younger Perry does not have a reflection, and [[paparazzi]] taking pictures (one of whom is dressed as [[Freddy Krueger]]) are seen behind the mirror. The floor begins to crumble as Perry finally shatters the mirror and the shards of the glass become butterflies.\n\nThe little girl is then seen pushing a wheelchair in which Perry sits in a hospital gown, trembling with the poisoned strawberry in one hand. In the hallway, they are met by two [[minotaur]] guards who block their way. The little girl furiously goes up to them and stomps her foot, sending the minotaurs flying. Perry gets up from the wheelchair, grabbing the little girl's hand as they run down the hallway to the exit. The doors open to reveal a garden. A man dressed as [[Prince Charming]] appears riding a [[unicorn]], and walks to Perry with [[Crossed fingers|fingers crossed]] behind his back. Perry punches him in the face, sending him through the fence. Perry and the girl find a heart-shaped exit, and the two girls [[high-five]]. They hug each other before the little girl places something in Perry's closed fist. The little girl rides away into a suburban neighborhood on a bike with a [[license plate]] reading \"Katheryn\", which is Katy's birth name. Perry returns to her dressing room and opens her fist, revealing a butterfly. The camera pans to a concert stage where Perry stands on a rising platform, and sings the beginning bars of \"[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]\" to a full audience as the butterfly flies into the arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1687787/katy-perry-wide-awake-scenes/|title=Katy Perry's 'Wide Awake' Video: Five Key Scenes|first=James|last=Montgomery|website=MTV News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Katy Perry Uses New Video For 'Wide Awake' To Slam Russell Brand|url=http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/06/19/katy-perry-wide-awake-music-video-russell-brand/|date=19 Jun 2012|author=Bonnie Fuller}}</ref>\n\n===Release and reception===\nThe video was supposed to have its world premiere on June 19, 2012.

{"title_page": "Belfast Harbour", "text_new": "{{Use British English|date=October 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Belfast Harbour''' is a major maritime hub in [[Northern Ireland]], handling 67% of Northern Ireland's seaborne trade and about 25% of the maritime trade of the entire island of [[Ireland]]. It is a vital gateway for raw materials, exports and consumer goods, and is also Northern Ireland's leading logistics and distribution hub.\n\nThe Belfast Harbour Estate is home to many well-known Northern Ireland businesses such as [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], [[Harland and Wolff]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]], Odyssey, the [[Catalyst Inc]], [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Titanic Quarter]] and [[Titanic Belfast]]. Over 700 firms employing 23,000 people are located within the estate.\n\nBelfast is only one of two ports on the island of Ireland to handle a full range of cargoes, from freight vehicles to containers, dry, break and liquid bulk, as well as passenger services and cruise calls.\n\nBelfast Harbour handled 23 million tonnes of cargo during 2015, similar to its throughput for 2014.  The tonnages suggest a varying performance between sectors in the wider Northern Ireland economy.\n\nBBC One Northern Ireland began a three-part documentary on Belfast Harbour entitled, Belfast Harbour: Cruises, Cranes and Cargo on Tuesday, 14 April 2020 examining the role of the Port of Belfast in Northern Ireland's economy. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gzxr]\n[[File:Dusk at Belfast docks - geograph.org.uk - 1619438.jpg|thumb|Belfast docks in 2009]]\n\n==History==\nBelfast Harbour's origins date back to 1613 when a [[Royal Charter]] for the incorporation of Belfast specified the need for a wharf at the confluence of the rivers Lagan and Farset in what is modern-day Belfast's High Street.\n\nGeorge Benn, in his 1877 History of the Town of Belfast described the early harbour as a poor little harbour'\n\n\"The dock, if it could be so-called; or creek, or quay-room proper, extend a considerable way up the river, but its fixed and best-known bounds reached from the sea to the present Skipper Street. This small and most obscure port was the nucleus of the great docks and harbour of modern days.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Benn|first=George|title=History of the Town of Belfast|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nRecords show that by 1663 there were 29 vessels owned in Belfast with a total tonnage of 1,100 tonnes. Trade continued to expand throughout the century, to the extent that the original quay was enlarged, to accommodate the increasing number of ships.\n\nBy the early 18th century Belfast had replaced [[Carrickfergus]] as the most important port in [[Ulster]] and additional accommodation was necessary. A number of privately owned wharves were subsequently constructed on reclaimed land. Throughout the century trade continued to expand as Belfast assumed a greater role in the trading activities of the country as a whole. In 1785 the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] passed an act to deal with the town's burgeoning port. As a result, a new body was constituted: The Corporation for Preserving and Improving the Port and Harbour of Belfast, commonly called 'the Ballast Board'.\n\nThe Ballast Board took over the running of the port from the Belfast Corporation. The Ballast Office was established in premises on the site of the present Customs House.\n\nAlthough already well established by this stage, the Port remained disadvantaged by the natural restrictions of shallow water, bends in the channel approach and inadequate quays. Most vessels were forced to lighten their loads downstream at Garmoyle before they could dock at the quays and complete their discharge. This cost importers extra handling charges and the need for additional Customs supervision.\n\nThese problems, together with an increasing volume of trade, led to a new government act of 1837 under the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]]. This reconstituted the Board and gave it powers to improve the port, through the formation of a new channel. Initial work on straightening the river commenced in 1839 and by 1841 the first bend had been eliminated. Thus beginning the creation of what was to become known as the Victoria Channel. The Victoria Channel was completed in 1849. The Clarendon Dock opened in 1851 and the Dufferin and Spencer Docks opened in 1897.\n\nIn 1847 the Belfast Harbour Act repealed previous acts and led to the formation of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. This new body, with much wider powers, completed the second stage of the new channel two years later. From that time the Commissioners have developed and improved the Port, reclaiming land to accommodate new quays, new trades and changes in shipping and cargo-handling technology.\n\n[[File:HMS Caroline 1914.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}} is a First World War light cruiser permanently berthed in Belfast Harbour]]\nDuring World War II the ''Port of Belfast''  was used by the [[Royal Navy]] as the home base for many of the ships that escorted [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Russian convoys]] including {{sclass-|Captain|frigate}}s of the 3rd Escort Group. {{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}} is a First World War light cruiser permanently berthed in Belfast Harbour and currently serves as the training ship for some 130 reservists as the headquarters for the Ulster Division Royal Naval Reserve. She is the second oldest commissioned warship in the Royal Navy.\n\nBelfast West Power Station (formerly Power Station West) was opened in 1961 on a site in the port subleased to the Belfast Corporation Electricity Department. This subleased is today held by [[Northern Ireland Electricity]]. The station continued to generate electricity until its closure in March 2002. On 6 July 2007 the station's three {{convert|240|ft|m|abbr=on}} chimneys were demolished by controlled explosion and the remainder of the site was cleared in the following months.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6278312.stm Tall chimneys come down to earth]</ref> The site continues to be managed by NIE on behalf of the utility regulator which has stated that the various conditions of the lease \"suggest that the best use for the site going forward is electrical generation.

Trust Ports are not owned by Government; they are obliged to operate independently and on a commercial basis.

It is a vital gateway for raw materials, exports and consumer goods, and is also Northern Ireland's leading logistics and distribution hub.\n\nThe Belfast Harbour Estate is home to many well-known Northern Ireland businesses such as [[George Best Belfast City Airport]], [[Harland and Wolff]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]], Odyssey, the [[Catalyst Inc]], [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Titanic Quarter]] and [[Titanic Belfast]]. Over 700 firms employing 23,000 people are located within the estate.\n\nBelfast is only one of two ports on the island of Ireland to handle a full range of cargoes, from freight vehicles to containers, dry, break and liquid bulk, as well as passenger services and cruise calls.\n\nBelfast Harbour handled 23 million tonnes of cargo during 2015, similar to its throughput for 2014.  The tonnages suggest a varying performance between sectors in the wider Northern Ireland economy.\n\nBBC1 television in Northern Ireland began a three-part documentary on Belfast Harbour entitled, Belfast Harbour: Cruises, Cranes and Cargo on Tuesday, 14 April 2020 examining the role of the Port of Belfast in Northern Ireland's economy. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gzxr]\n[[File:Dusk at Belfast docks - geograph.org.uk - 1619438.jpg|thumb|Belfast docks in 2009]]\n\n==History==\nBelfast Harbour's origins date back to 1613 when a [[Royal Charter]] for the incorporation of Belfast specified the need for a wharf at the confluence of the rivers Lagan and Farset in what is modern-day Belfast's High Street.\n\nGeorge Benn, in his 1877 History of the Town of Belfast described the early harbour as a poor little harbour'\n\n\"The dock, if it could be so-called; or creek, or quay-room proper, extend a considerable way up the river, but its fixed and best-known bounds reached from the sea to the present Skipper Street. This small and most obscure port was the nucleus of the great docks and harbour of modern days.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Benn|first=George|title=History of the Town of Belfast|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nRecords show that by 1663 there were 29 vessels owned in Belfast with a total tonnage of 1,100 tonnes. Trade continued to expand throughout the century, to the extent that the original quay was enlarged, to accommodate the increasing number of ships.\n\nBy the early 18th century Belfast had replaced [[Carrickfergus]] as the most important port in [[Ulster]] and additional accommodation was necessary. A number of privately owned wharves were subsequently constructed on reclaimed land. Throughout the century trade continued to expand as Belfast assumed a greater role in the trading activities of the country as a whole. In 1785 the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] passed an act to deal with the town's burgeoning port. As a result, a new body was constituted: The Corporation for Preserving and Improving the Port and Harbour of Belfast, commonly called 'the Ballast Board'.\n\nThe Ballast Board took over the running of the port from the Belfast Corporation. The Ballast Office was established in premises on the site of the present Customs House.\n\nAlthough already well established by this stage, the Port remained disadvantaged by the natural restrictions of shallow water, bends in the channel approach and inadequate quays. Most vessels were forced to lighten their loads downstream at Garmoyle before they could dock at the quays and complete their discharge. This cost importers extra handling charges and the need for additional Customs supervision.\n\nThese problems, together with an increasing volume of trade, led to a new government act of 1837 under the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]]. This reconstituted the Board and gave it powers to improve the port, through the formation of a new channel. Initial work on straightening the river commenced in 1839 and by 1841 the first bend had been eliminated. Thus beginning the creation of what was to become known as the Victoria Channel. The Victoria Channel was completed in 1849. The Clarendon Dock opened in 1851 and the Dufferin and Spencer Docks opened in 1897.\n\nIn 1847 the Belfast Harbour Act repealed previous acts and led to the formation of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. This new body, with much wider powers, completed the second stage of the new channel two years later. From that time the Commissioners have developed and improved the Port, reclaiming land to accommodate new quays, new trades and changes in shipping and cargo-handling technology.\n\n[[File:HMS Caroline 1914.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}} is a First World War light cruiser permanently berthed in Belfast Harbour]]\nDuring World War II the ''Port of Belfast''  was used by the [[Royal Navy]] as the home base for many of the ships that escorted [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Russian convoys]] including {{sclass-|Captain|frigate}}s of the 3rd Escort Group. {{HMS|Caroline|1914|6}} is a First World War light cruiser permanently berthed in Belfast Harbour and currently serves as the training ship for some 130 reservists as the headquarters for the Ulster Division Royal Naval Reserve.

By 1916 in Britain, the leader of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"<ref>Peter Yearwood, \"\u2018On the Safe and Right Lines\u2019: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916\u20131918.\" ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131\u2013155.</ref>\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.<ref>P.

Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]\",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}\n\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]].

Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations.

The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=182}} This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]], and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.{{sfn|Baumslag|2005|p=8}}\n\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual co-operation since its creation.{{sfn|Grandjean|2018}} The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] became the first chairman of the committee.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=186\u2013187}} The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=187\u2013189}}\n\nIntroduced by the second [[International Opium Convention]], the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in [[opium]], morphine, cocaine and heroin.

The League secured a commitment from [[Ethiopia]] to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with [[Liberia]] to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery.

The first member to withdraw permanently from the League was [[Costa Rica]] on 22 January 1925; having joined on 16 December 1920, this also makes it the member to have most quickly withdrawn. [[Brazil]] was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and [[Haiti]] the last (April 1942). [[Iraq]], which joined in 1932, was the first member that had previously been a [[League of Nations mandate]].{{sfn|Tripp|2002|p=75}}\n\nThe Soviet Union became a member on 18 September 1934,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} and was expelled on 14 December 1939{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} for [[Winter War|invading Finland]]. In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own rule: only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for expulsion (United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]), short of the majority required by the Covenant. Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt).

Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=194\u2013195}} With the exception of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], which joined the League on 3 October 1932,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=216}} these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990.

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}\n\n===\u00c5land Islands===\n{{Main|\u00c5land crisis}}\n[[\u00c5land]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included \u00c5land in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n===Upper Silesia===\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82\u201383}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}\n\n===Albania===\nThe frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}\n\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}\n\n===Memel===\n{{Main|Klaip\u0117da Revolt}}\nThe port city of [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (now [[Klaip\u0117da]]) and [[Klaip\u0117da Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaip\u0117da Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war.

According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131\u2013135}}\n\n===Vilnius===\n{{Main|\u017beligowski's Mutiny}}\nAfter the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwa\u0142ki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}\n\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|former union which both Poland and Lithuania]] had once shared before losing its independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78\u201379}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}\n\n===Colombia and Peru===\n{{Main|Colombia\u2013Peru War|Leticia dispute}}\nThere were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414\u2013415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro|Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=251}} In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and [[Putumayo River]]s, and a pledge of [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The verdict of the League|year=1934|editor=Hudson, Manley|publisher=World Peace Foundation|pages=1\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Saar===\n[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Churchill|1986|p=98}}\n\n==Other conflicts==\nIn addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/%28httpPages%29/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=The United Nations in the Heart of Europe|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132257/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greece and Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Incident at Petrich}}\nAfter an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}} Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.

They renamed the area [[Manchukuo]], and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with [[Pu Yi]], the former emperor of China, as its executive head.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=139}} This new entity was recognised only by the governments of Italy, Spain and Nazi Germany; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China.\n\nThe League of Nations sent observers. The [[Lytton Report]] appeared a year later (October 1932). It declared Japan to be the aggressor and demanded Manchuria be returned to China.  The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156\u2013161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:\n:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p. 420.</ref>\n\n===Chaco War===\n{{Main|Chaco War}}\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]], which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=242\u2013243}} and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum.{{sfn|Levy|2001|pp=21\u201322}} Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].{{sfn|Bethell|1991|p=495}} Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American Conference]] offered to mediate instead. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=248}} It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster.

The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=173}} Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}\n\nThe [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states.

There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\n===Origins and structure===\nThe origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a \"League of Victors\".{{sfn|Gorodetsky|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Raffo|1974|p=1}} The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.<ref>{{cite book|pages=226\u2013227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=978-0-19-822650-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279\u2013282, 288\u2013292}}\n\n===Global representation===\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the [[Russian Civil War]] in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937 after roughly a year following the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in a victory for the Nationalists. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a \"peace-loving country\", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}\n\n===Collective security===\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.<ref name = \"events\" />}}\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].<ref>Ditrych, Ondrej. '' 'International Terrorism' as Conspiracy: Debating Terrorism in the League of Nations''. [[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:\n:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.<ref>Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.</ref>\n\n===Pacifism and disarmament===\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54\u20135}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238\u2013240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nWhen the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, \"Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious\".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:\n\n{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}\n\nThe Foreign Office civil servant Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that \"a solemn league and covenant\" would just be \"a treaty, like other treaties\". \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned \"pledge of common action\" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that \"It is all a question of real military preponderance\". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n[[File:18-IV-1946.png|right|thumb|500px|World map showing [[member states of the League of Nations]] (in green and red) on 18 April 1946, when the League of Nations ceased to exist.]][[File:Humanit\u00e9s Num\u00e9riques.JPG|thumb|right|League of Nations archives, Geneva.<ref>League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the [[rule of law]] across the globe; strengthened the concept of [[collective security]], giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like [[epidemics]], [[slavery]], [[child labour]], colonial tyranny, [[refugee|refugee crises]] and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the [[mandate system]] put the colonial powers under international observation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=Susan|title=Back to the League of Nations|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=112|issue=4|pages=1091\u20131117|date=October 2007|publisher=American Historical Review|jstor=40008445|doi=10.1086/ahr.112.4.1091}}</ref>\n\nProfessor [[David M.

[[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and it became effective together with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920.\n\nThe diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious [[Allies of World War I|First World War Allies]] (France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan were the permanent members of the Executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The [[Great Power#Great powers at war|Great Powers]] were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting [[Red Cross]] medical tents, [[Benito Mussolini]] responded that \"the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|title=The Elusiveness of Trust: the experience of Security Council and Iran|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Transnational Foundation of Peace and Future Research|last=Jahanpour|first=Farhang|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727102504/http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was weakened by the fact that the [[United States]] never joined the League and the [[Soviet Union]] joined late and was soon expelled after [[Winter War|invading Finland]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The participation of the Soviet Union in universal international organizations.: A political and legal analysis of Soviet strategies and aspirations inside ILO, UNESCO and WHO | author=Osakwe, C O | year=1972 | publisher=Springer | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2OmtJvNjHoC | page=5| isbn=978-9028600027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Pericles, Lewis | year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | title=Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-ImKOwYvsoC | page=52| isbn=9781139426589 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Historical Dictionary of the League of Nations | author=Ginneken, Anique H.

By 1916 in Britain, the leader of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"<ref>Peter Yearwood, \"\u2018On the Safe and Right Lines\u2019: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916\u20131918.\" ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131\u2013155.</ref>\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.<ref>P.

Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]\",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}\n\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]]. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918.

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}\n\n===\u00c5land Islands===\n{{Main|\u00c5land crisis}}\n[[\u00c5land]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included \u00c5land in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n===Upper Silesia===\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82\u201383}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}\n\n===Albania===\nThe frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}\n\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}\n\n===Memel===\n{{Main|Klaip\u0117da Revolt}}\nThe port city of [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (now [[Klaip\u0117da]]) and [[Klaip\u0117da Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaip\u0117da Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.\n\n===Hatay===\n{{Main|Hatay State}}\nWith League oversight, the [[Sanjak]] of [[\u0130skenderun|Alexandretta]] in the [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] was given autonomy in 1937. Renamed Hatay, its parliament declared independence as the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] in September 1938, after elections the previous month. It was annexed by [[Turkey]] with French consent in mid-1939.<ref>{{cite book|pages=117\u2013121|author=\u00c7a\u01e7aptay, Soner|title=Islam, secularism, and nationalism in modern Turkey|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-38458-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mosul===\n{{Main|Mosul Question}}\nThe League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of [[Mosul Vilayet|Mosul]] in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131\u2013135}}\n\n===Vilnius===\n{{Main|\u017beligowski's Mutiny}}\nAfter the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwa\u0142ki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}\n\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|former union which both Poland and Lithuania]] had once shared before losing its independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78\u201379}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}\n\n===Colombia and Peru===\n{{Main|Colombia\u2013Peru War|Leticia dispute}}\nThere were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414\u2013415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro|Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=251}} In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and [[Putumayo River]]s, and a pledge of [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The verdict of the League|year=1934|editor=Hudson, Manley|publisher=World Peace Foundation|pages=1\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Saar===\n[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Churchill|1986|p=98}}\n\n==Other conflicts==\nIn addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/%28httpPages%29/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=The United Nations in the Heart of Europe|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132257/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greece and Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Incident at Petrich}}\nAfter an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}} Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.

They renamed the area [[Manchukuo]], and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with [[Pu Yi]], the former emperor of China, as its executive head.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=139}} This new entity was recognised only by the governments of Italy, Spain and Nazi Germany; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China.\n\nThe League of Nations sent observers. The [[Lytton Report]] appeared a year later (October 1932). It declared Japan to be the aggressor and demanded Manchuria be returned to China.  The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156\u2013161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:\n:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p. 420.</ref>\n\n===Chaco War===\n{{Main|Chaco War}}\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]], which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=242\u2013243}} and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum.{{sfn|Levy|2001|pp=21\u201322}} Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].{{sfn|Bethell|1991|p=495}} Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American Conference]] offered to mediate instead.

Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}\n\nThe [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states.

In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement,<ref>{{cite book|first=Meirion and Susie|last=Harries|title=Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army|page=163|isbn=978-0-394-56935-2|year=1991}}</ref> as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy and Spain in 1937.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=47, 133}} The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after [[Winter War|it invaded Finland]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=273}}\n\n==General weaknesses==\n[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumb|'''The Gap in the Bridge'''; the sign reads \"This League of Nations Bridge was designed by the President of the U.S.A.\"\nCartoon from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, 10 December 1920, satirising the gap left by the US not joining the League.]]\nThe onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\n===Origins and structure===\nThe origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a \"League of Victors\".{{sfn|Gorodetsky|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Raffo|1974|p=1}} The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.<ref>{{cite book|pages=226\u2013227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=978-0-19-822650-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279\u2013282, 288\u2013292}}\n\n===Global representation===\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the [[Russian Civil War]] in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937 after roughly a year following the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in a victory for the Nationalists. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a \"peace-loving country\", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}\n\n===Collective security===\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.<ref name = \"events\" />}}\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].<ref>Ditrych, Ondrej. '' 'International Terrorism' as Conspiracy: Debating Terrorism in the League of Nations''. [[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:\n:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.<ref>Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.</ref>\n\n===Pacifism and disarmament===\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54\u20135}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238\u2013240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nWhen the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, \"Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious\".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:\n\n{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}\n\nThe Foreign Office civil servant Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that \"a solemn league and covenant\" would just be \"a treaty, like other treaties\". \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned \"pledge of common action\" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that \"It is all a question of real military preponderance\". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n[[File:18-IV-1946.png|right|thumb|500px|World map showing [[member states of the League of Nations]] (in green and red) on 18 April 1946, when the League of Nations ceased to exist.]][[File:Humanit\u00e9s Num\u00e9riques.JPG|thumb|right|League of Nations archives, Geneva.<ref>League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.
