It is  the most important archaeological site in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe settlement developed as a trading centre at the head of a narrow, navigable inlet known as the [[Schlei]], which connects to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The location was favorable because there is a short portage of less than 15&nbsp;km to the [[Treene River]], which flows into the [[Eider River|Eider]] with its [[North Sea]] estuary, making it a convenient place where goods and ships could be pulled on a [[corduroy road]] overland for an almost uninterrupted seaway between the Baltic and the North Sea and avoid a dangerous and time-consuming circumnavigation of Jutland, providing Hedeby with a role similar to later [[L\u00fcbeck]].\nHedeby was the second largest Nordic town during the Viking Age, after [[Upp\u00e5kra]] in present-day southern Sweden,<ref>Sveriges riksdag, [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/Fornlamningen-Uppakra_GX02Kr327/?text=true Motion 2009/10:Kr327 Fornl\u00e4mningen Upp\u00e5kra] 2009-10-05</ref>\nThe city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]] was later founded on the other side of the Schlei.

Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre. Along with [[Birka]] and [[Schleswig]], Hedeby's prominence as a major international trading hub served as a foundation of the [[Hanseatic League]] that would emerge by the 12th century.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smith |first=Jillian R. |date=May 2010 |title=Hanseatic Cogs and Baltic Trade: Interrelations Between Trade, Technology and Ecology |type= |chapter=2 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |docket= |oclc= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/anthrotheses/4 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women.

He set the town on fire by sending several burning ships into the harbour, the charred remains of which were found at the bottom of the Schlei during recent excavations. A Norwegian ''[[skald]]'', quoted by [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes the sack as follows:\n:''Burnt in anger from end to end was Hedeby[..]''\n:''High rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, I stood upon the stronghold's arm''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Sagan_af_Haraldi_har%C3%B0r%C3%A1%C3%B0a | title=Sagan af Haraldi har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0a \u2013 heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 1066 the town was [[Looting|sacked]] and burned by [[West Slavs]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Nancy Marie Brown|title=The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUE9ZFNeCBsC&pg=PT110 |accessdate=6 March 2016|pages=95}}</ref> Following the destruction, Hedeby was slowly abandoned. People moved across the [[Schlei]] [[F\u00f6rde|inlet]], which separates the two peninsulas of [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]], and founded the town of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===20th-century excavations===\nAfter the settlement was abandoned, rising waters contributed to the complete disappearance of all visible structures on the site. It was even forgotten where the settlement had been. This proved to be fortunate for later archaeological work at the site.\n\n[[File:File Haithabu Wikinger Museum 3 28-03-2010.jpg|thumb|View of the Viking Museum]]\n\nArchaeological work began at the site in 1900 after the rediscovery of the settlement. Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since. The embankments surrounding the settlement were excavated, and the harbour was partially dredged, during which the wreck of a [[Viking ship]] was discovered. Despite all this work, only 5% of the settlement (and only 1% of the harbour) has as yet been investigated.\n\nThe most important finds resulting from the excavations are now on display in the adjoining [[Hedeby Viking Museum|Haithabu Museum]].\n\n[[File:Hedebyhouses010.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed houses]]\n\n===21st-century reconstructions===\nIn 2005 an ambitious archaeological reconstruction program was initiated on the original site.

It is  the most important archaeological site in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe settlement developed as a trading centre at the head of a narrow, navigable inlet known as the [[Schlei]], which connects to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The location was favorable because there is a short portage of less than 15&nbsp;km to the [[Treene River]], which flows into the [[Eider River|Eider]] with its [[North Sea]] estuary, making it a convenient place where goods and ships could be pulled on a [[corduroy road]] overland for an almost uninterrupted seaway between the Baltic and the North Sea and avoid a dangerous and time-consuming circumnavigation of Jutland, providing Hedeby with a role similar to later [[L\u00fcbeck]].\nHedeby was the second largest Nordic town during the Viking Age, after [[Upp\u00e5kra]] in present-day southern Sweden,<ref>Sveriges riksdag, [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/Fornlamningen-Uppakra_GX02Kr327/?text=true Motion 2009/10:Kr327 Fornl\u00e4mningen Upp\u00e5kra] 2009-10-05</ref>\nThe city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]] was later founded on the other side of the Schlei.

On the eastern side, the town was bordered by the innermost part of the Schlei inlet and the bay of [[Haddebyer Noor]].\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"centre\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|colspan=1 style=\"padding:0.3em;border-collapse:collapse;background-color:#ccccff\" align=center|based on Elsner<ref>{{cite book | first = Hildegard | last = Elsner | year = 1989 | title = Wikinger Museum Haithabu: Schaufenster einer fr\u00fchen Stadt | chapter = | editor = | others = | pages = | location = Neum\u00fcnster | publisher = Wachholtz | id = | url = | authorlink = }}</ref>\n|-\n|valign=top|'''793'''\n|Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] - traditional date for the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].\n|-\n|valign=top|'''804'''\n|First mention of Hedeby\n|-\n|valign=top|'''808'''\n|Destruction of [[Reric]] and migration of tradespeople to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''c. 850'''\n|Construction of a church at Hedeby\n|-\n|'''886'''\n|The [[Danelaw]] is established in [[England]], following Viking invasion\n|-\n|'''911'''\n|The Vikings settle in [[Normandy]]\n|-\n|'''948'''\n|Hedeby becomes a bishopric\n|-\n|'''965'''\n|Visit of [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''974'''\n|Hedeby falls to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|-\n|'''983'''\n|Hedeby returns to Danish control\n|-\n|'''c. 1000'''\n|The Viking [[Leif Erikson]] explores [[Vinland]], probably in Newfoundland\n|-\n|'''1016-1042'''\n|Danish kings rule in England\n|-\n|'''1050'''\n|The Norwegian King [[Harald Hardrada]] destroys Hedeby\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Final destruction of Hedeby by a Slavic army.\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Traditional end of the [[Viking Age]]\n|}\n\n===Rise===\nHedeby became a principal marketplace because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre. Along with [[Birka]] and [[Schleswig]], Hedeby's prominence as a major international trading hub served as a foundation of the [[Hanseatic League]] that would emerge by the 12th century.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smith |first=Jillian R. |date=May 2010 |title=Hanseatic Cogs and Baltic Trade: Interrelations Between Trade, Technology and Ecology |type= |chapter=2 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |docket= |oclc= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/anthrotheses/4 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women.

He set the town on fire by sending several burning ships into the harbour, the charred remains of which were found at the bottom of the Schlei during recent excavations. A Norwegian ''[[skald]]'', quoted by [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes the sack as follows:\n:''Burnt in anger from end to end was Hedeby[..]''\n:''High rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, I stood upon the stronghold's arm''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Sagan_af_Haraldi_har%C3%B0r%C3%A1%C3%B0a | title=Sagan af Haraldi har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0a \u2013 heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 1066 the town was [[Looting|sacked]] and burned by [[West Slavs]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Nancy Marie Brown|title=The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUE9ZFNeCBsC&pg=PT110 |accessdate=6 March 2016|pages=95}}</ref> Following the destruction, Hedeby was slowly abandoned. People moved across the [[Schlei]] [[F\u00f6rde|inlet]], which separates the two peninsulas of [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]], and founded the town of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===20th-century excavations===\nAfter the settlement was abandoned, rising waters contributed to the complete disappearance of all visible structures on the site. It was even forgotten where the settlement had been. This proved to be fortunate for later archaeological work at the site.\n\n[[File:File Haithabu Wikinger Museum 3 28-03-2010.jpg|thumb|View of the Viking Museum]]\n\nArchaeological work began at the site in 1900 after the rediscovery of the settlement. Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since. The embankments surrounding the settlement were excavated, and the harbour was partially dredged, during which the wreck of a [[Viking ship]] was discovered. Despite all this work, only 5% of the settlement (and only 1% of the harbour) has as yet been investigated.\n\nThe most important finds resulting from the excavations are now on display in the adjoining [[Hedeby Viking Museum|Haithabu Museum]].\n\n[[File:Hedebyhouses010.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed houses]]\n\n===21st-century reconstructions===\nIn 2005 an ambitious archaeological reconstruction program was initiated on the original site.

However due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] the second season has been placed on hold.\n\n== Format ==\n''Love Island'' involves a group of contestants, referred to as Islanders, living in isolation from the outside world in a villa in [[Fiji]], constantly under video surveillance. To survive in the villa the Islanders must be coupled up with another Islander, whether it be for love, friendship or money, as the overall winning couple receives $100,000. On the first day, the Islanders couple up for the first time based on first impressions, but over the duration of the series, they are forced to \"re-couple\" where they can choose (or be chosen) to remain in their current couple or swap and change.\n\nAny Islander who remains single after the coupling is eliminated and \"dumped\" from the island. Islanders can also be eliminated via a public vote during the series. The public can vote for their favorite couple or who they think is the most compatible through the ''Love Island'' app available on [[smartphones]]. Couples who receive the fewest votes risk being eliminated. Occasionally, twists may occur where the islanders must eliminate each other. During the final week, the public vote for which couple they want to win the series and take home the prize.\n\nWhilst in the villa, each Islander has their own phone with which they can only contact other Islanders via text \u2013 or receive texts informing them of the latest challenges, dumping, or re-coupling. Islanders and couples must typically take part in many games and challenges designed to test their physical and mental abilities, with the winners receiving special prizes afterward. Some Islanders are also sent on dates outside the villa or can win dates by winning challenges.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn February 22, 2006, it was announced that an American version of ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Celebrity Love Island]]'' was in development at [[MyNetworkTV]], but the show was not produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-corp-unveils-my-network-tv-78935|title=News Corp.

However due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] the second season has been placed on hold.\n\n== Format ==\n''Love Island'' involves a group of contestants, referred to as Islanders, living in isolation from the outside world in a villa in [[Fiji]], constantly under video surveillance. To survive in the villa the Islanders must be coupled up with another Islander, whether it be for love, friendship or money, as the overall winning couple receives $100,000. On the first day, the Islanders couple up for the first time based on first impressions, but over the duration of the series, they are forced to \"re-couple\" where they can choose (or be chosen) to remain in their current couple or swap and change.\n\nAny Islander who remains single after the coupling is eliminated and \"dumped\" from the island. Islanders can also be eliminated via a public vote during the series. The public can vote for their favorite couple or who they think is the most compatible through the ''Love Island'' app available on [[smartphones]]. Couples who receive the fewest votes risk being eliminated. Occasionally, twists may occur where the islanders must eliminate each other. During the final week, the public vote for which couple they want to win the series and take home the prize.\n\nWhilst in the villa, each Islander has their own phone with which they can only contact other Islanders via text \u2013 or receive texts informing them of the latest challenges, dumping, or re-coupling. Islanders and couples must typically take part in many games and challenges designed to test their physical and mental abilities, with the winners receiving special prizes afterward. Some Islanders are also sent on dates outside the villa or can win dates by winning challenges.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn February 22, 2006, it was announced that an American version of ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Celebrity Love Island]]'' was in development at [[MyNetworkTV]], but the show was not produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-corp-unveils-my-network-tv-78935|title=News Corp.

The primary reason for the use of such bells is to create a joyful noise to the Lord as a way to give thanks for the miracle taking place atop the [[altar]].<ref name=\"ewtn.com\">[http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/sanctusbells.pdf Herrera, Matthew D.''Sanctus Bells: Their History and Use in the Catholic Church.'' San Luis Obispo:  Tixlini Scriptorium, 2004]</ref> An ancillary function of the bells is to focus the attention of those attending the Mass that a supernatural event is taking place on the altar.<ref name=\"ewtn.com\"/> Such bells are also commonly referred to as the '''Mass bell''', '''sacring bell''', '''Sacryn bell''', '''saints' bell''', '''sance-bell''', or '''sanctus bell''' (or \"bells\", when there are two or more).<ref name=\"ewtn.com\"/> and are kept on the [[credence table|credence]] table or some other convenient location within the sanctuary.\n\n==Use in the Catholic Church==\n\n===Use at Mass===\n\n\"A little before the Consecration, if appropriate, a minister rings a small bell as a signal to the faithful.\"<ref name=GIRM150>[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal], 150</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/generalinstructi0000smol/page/n30 <!-- quote=bell \"roman missal\". --> Dennis Chester Smolarski, \"The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 1969-2002: A Commentary\"] ({{ISBN|978-0-8146-2936-9}}), pp. 20-21</ref> The usual moment chosen for giving the signal of the approach of the Consecration is when the priest stretches out his hands over the host and the chalice while reciting the [[epiclesis]]. Mention of this signal was introduced into the [[Roman Missal]] in [[Pope John XXIII]]'s 1962 revision.<ref>''Minister paulo ante Consecrationem campanulae signo fideles moneat'' (''Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'', VIII, 6 in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, but not in earlier editions)</ref> Even before 1962 it was common practice to give this signal, although it then \"ha[d] no authority\".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03255c.htm Adrian Fortescue, ''Canon of the Mass''], in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]</ref>\n\nAll pre-1970 editions of the Roman Missal, including that of 1962, prescribe continuous ringing of the altar bell while the priest recites the words of the Sanctus at [[Low Mass]].<ref>''Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'', VII, 8</ref> but, in line with its abolition of a hard and fast distinction between sung and merely spoken Mass, the 1970 edition makes no mention of that practice.\n\nAccording to local custom, the server also rings the bell as the priest shows the [[host (Holy Communion)|host]] and then the [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]<ref name=GIRM150/> Pre-1970 editions of the Roman Missal prescribe either a triple or a continuous ringing of the bell at each showing of the consecrated elements.<ref>''Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'', VIII, 6</ref> Pre-1962 editions also prescribe that the server should first light a torch, to be extinguished only after the priest has consumed the chalice or has given Communion to any others who are to receive the Eucharist.<ref>''Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'', VIII, 6 in pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal</ref>\n\nOn 10 September 1898, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments|Congregation of Sacred Rites]] declared inappropriate the use of a [[gong]] instead of the altar bell.<ref name=\"ewtn.com\"/>\n\nThe ringing of an altar bell began probably in the 13th century.<ref name=McNamara>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur94.htm Bells at the Consecration]</ref> It is not mentioned in the original 1570 [[Roman Missal]] of [[Pope Pius V]]<ref>Missale Romanum.

The game proceeds when a player on the [[fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]], called the [[pitcher]], throws a ball which a player on the [[batting team (baseball)|batting team]] tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team ([[Batting team (baseball)|batting team]]) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"[[Run (baseball)|runs]]\". The objective of the defensive team ([[Fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]]) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' [[base running|advance around the bases]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Rules of MLB, 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]]. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"[[Out (baseball)|out]]\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, [[extra innings]] are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the [[Baseball in the United States|United States]]. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]] and [[Sports in Taiwan#Baseball|Taiwan]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League]]s and in Cuba between the [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]], organized by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n==Rules and gameplay==\n{{Further|Baseball rules|Outline of baseball}}\n[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Diagram of a [[baseball field]] (the term ''diamond'' may be used to refer to the square area defined by the four bases or to the entire playing field).

Children often play on smaller fields.]]\n\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense ([[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[baserunning]]) and defense ([[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an [[inning]].

The other team\u2014customarily the home team\u2014bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, [[counterclockwise]], from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest.

The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the [[infield]]; the area farther beyond the infield is the [[outfield]]. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center.

On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate\u2014for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game.

In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.<ref>Mount, Nicholas James, \"Team Sports\", in ''Encyclopedia of Time'', ed. Samuel L.

In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\".<ref>Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.</ref> Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The [[baseball statistics|statistical precision of baseball]] is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.<ref>Morton, Richard, \"Baseball in England\", ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157\u2013158: \"The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.\"</ref>\n\n=== Uniqueness of each baseball park ===\n{{Further|Baseball park}}\n[[File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg|thumb|[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[Green Monster]] is visible beyond the playing field on the left.]]\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]], is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game.

For example, at [[Minute Maid Park]], which became the home of the [[Houston Astros]] in 2000, the [[Crawford Boxes]] in left field are only {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} from home plate.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nightengale, Bob|date=August 20, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm|title=No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=USA Today}}</ref> There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 219.</ref> A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or [[inside-the-park home run]].<ref>Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 198; {{cite news|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=May 27, 2006|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/27/sports/sp-angels27|title=Guerrero Becomes Mr. Inside|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> The surface of the field is also unregulated.

Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude\u2014{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level\u2014is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.<ref>Keri (2007), pp. 295\u2013301.</ref> [[Wrigley Field]], home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106&vkey=ps2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|archivedate=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the [[New York Yankees]], will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time\u2014even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n{{Further|Baseball statistics}}\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] of [[Brooklyn]], was responsible for the \"development of the [[box score (baseball)|box score]], tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\"<ref name=T16>Tygiel (2000), p. 16.</ref> The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball.<ref name=T16/> In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian [[Alan Schwarz]] describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"<ref>Schwarz (2004), p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the [[official scorer]] to categorize each baseball play unambiguously.

The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, [[Bill James]], and derives from the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR).<ref>Gray, Scott, ''The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outsider Changed Baseball'' (Doubleday, 2006), p. ix.</ref>\n\nThe growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:<ref>Guzzo (2007), pp. 20\u201321, 67; Schwarz (2004), p. 233; Lewis (2003), p. 127.</ref>\n* [[On-base percentage]] measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00\u2014The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21f)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Slugging percentage]] measures a batter's ability to hit for power.

[[Baseball card]]s were introduced in the late 19th century as [[trade card]]s. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards\u2014many of which are now prized collectibles\u2014are the source of the much broader [[trading card]] industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.<ref>Zoss (2004), pp. 16\u201325.</ref>\n\nModern [[fantasy sports]] began in 1980 with the invention of [[Fantasy baseball#Rotisserie League Baseball|Rotisserie League Baseball]] by New York writer [[Daniel Okrent]] and several friends.

The game proceeds when a player on the [[fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]], called the [[pitcher]], throws a ball which a player on the [[batting team (baseball)|batting team]] tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team ([[Batting team (baseball)|batting team]]) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"[[Run (baseball)|runs]]\". The objective of the defensive team ([[Fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]]) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' [[base running|advance around the bases]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Rules of MLB, 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]]. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"[[Out (baseball)|out]]\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, [[extra innings]] are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the [[Baseball in the United States|United States]]. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]] and [[Sports in Taiwan#Baseball|Taiwan]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League]]s and in Cuba between the [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]], organized by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n==Rules and gameplay==\n{{Further|Baseball rules|Outline of baseball}}\n[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Diagram of a [[baseball field]] (the term ''diamond'' may be used to refer to the square area defined by the four bases or to the entire playing field).

Children often play on smaller fields.]]\n\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense ([[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[baserunning]]) and defense ([[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an [[inning]].

The other team\u2014customarily the home team\u2014bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, [[counterclockwise]], from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.<ref>Thurston (2000), p. 15; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|title=Official Rules/Foreword|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124020327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|archivedate=24 January 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.01\u20131.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00\u2014Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/4.00\u2014Starting and Ending a Game (Rule 4.10)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the [[infield]]; the area farther beyond the infield is the [[outfield]]. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.04\u20131.07)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00\u2014Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are three basic tools of baseball: the [[baseball (ball)|ball]], the [[baseball bat|bat]], and the [[baseball glove|glove or mitt]]:\n* The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9&nbsp;inches (23 centimeters) in circumference.

On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate\u2014for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game.

In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.<ref>Mount, Nicholas James, \"Team Sports\", in ''Encyclopedia of Time'', ed. Samuel L.

In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\".<ref>Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.</ref> Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The [[baseball statistics|statistical precision of baseball]] is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.<ref>Morton, Richard, \"Baseball in England\", ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157\u2013158: \"The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.\"</ref>\n\n=== Uniqueness of each baseball park ===\n{{Further|Baseball park}}\n[[File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg|thumb|[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[Green Monster]] is visible beyond the playing field on the left.]]\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]], is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game.

For example, at [[Minute Maid Park]], which became the home of the [[Houston Astros]] in 2000, the [[Crawford Boxes]] in left field are only {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} from home plate.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nightengale, Bob|date=August 20, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm|title=No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=USA Today}}</ref> There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 219.</ref> A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or [[inside-the-park home run]].<ref>Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 198; {{cite news|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=May 27, 2006|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/27/sports/sp-angels27|title=Guerrero Becomes Mr. Inside|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> The surface of the field is also unregulated.

Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude\u2014{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level\u2014is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.<ref>Keri (2007), pp. 295\u2013301.</ref> [[Wrigley Field]], home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106&vkey=ps2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|archivedate=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the [[New York Yankees]], will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time\u2014even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n{{Further|Baseball statistics}}\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] of [[Brooklyn]], was responsible for the \"development of the [[box score (baseball)|box score]], tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\"<ref name=T16>Tygiel (2000), p. 16.</ref> The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball.<ref name=T16/> In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian [[Alan Schwarz]] describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"<ref>Schwarz (2004), p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the [[official scorer]] to categorize each baseball play unambiguously.

The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, [[Bill James]], and derives from the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR).<ref>Gray, Scott, ''The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outsider Changed Baseball'' (Doubleday, 2006), p. ix.</ref>\n\nThe growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:<ref>Guzzo (2007), pp. 20\u201321, 67; Schwarz (2004), p. 233; Lewis (2003), p. 127.</ref>\n* [[On-base percentage]] measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00\u2014The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21f)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Slugging percentage]] measures a batter's ability to hit for power.

[[Baseball card]]s were introduced in the late 19th century as [[trade card]]s. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards\u2014many of which are now prized collectibles\u2014are the source of the much broader [[trading card]] industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.<ref>Zoss (2004), pp. 16\u201325.</ref>\n\nModern [[fantasy sports]] began in 1980 with the invention of [[Fantasy baseball#Rotisserie League Baseball|Rotisserie League Baseball]] by New York writer [[Daniel Okrent]] and several friends.

A new flag was needed to represent the Congress and fledgling nation (initially the [[Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]]) with a banner distinct from the British [[Red Ensign]] flown from civilian and merchant vessels, the [[White Ensign]] of the British [[Royal Navy]], and the British union flags carried on land by the British army. The emerging states had been using their own independent flags, with Massachusetts using the [[Taunton Flag]], and New York using the [[George Rex Flag]], prior to the adoption of united colors.\n\nAmericans first hoisted the Colors on the colonial warship {{USS|Alfred|1774|2}}, in the harbor on the western shore of the [[Delaware River]] at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on December 3, 1775, by newly appointed Lieutenant [[John Paul Jones]] of the formative [[Continental Navy]].

The more recent moniker, \"Grand Union Flag\", was first applied in the 19th-century [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] by [[George Henry Preble]], in his 1872 ''History of the American Flag''.{{Sfn | Ansoff | 2006}}\n\nThe design of the Colors is strikingly similar to [[Flag of the East India Company|the flag of the British East India Company]] (EIC). Indeed, certain EIC designs in use since 1707 (when the canton was changed from the [[flag of England]] to that of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]) were nearly identical, but the number of stripes varied from 9 to 15. That EIC flags could be well have been known by the American colonists has been the basis of a theory of the origin of the national flag's design.{{Sfn | Fawcett | 1937}} \n\nVexillologist Nick Groom proposed the theory that the Grand Union was adopted by George Washington's army as a protest against the rule of the British Parliament but a profession of continued loyalty towards [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Groom, Nick,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/224734058|title=The Union Jack : the story of the British flag|date=2017|publisher=Atlantic Books|year=|isbn=1-84354-336-2|location=London|pages=187|oclc=224734058}}</ref> Groom argues that the inclusion of the Union Jack in the canton of the Grand Union is evidence of this sentiment.\n\nThe Grand Union became obsolete following the passing of the [[Flag Acts (United States)|Flag Act of 1777]] by the Continental Congress which authorized a new official national flag of a design similar to that of the Colors, with thirteen stars (representing [[Thirteen Colonies|the thirteen States]]) on a field of blue replacing the British Union Flag in the canton. The resolution describes only \"a new constellation\" for the arrangement of the white stars in the blue canton so a number of designs were later interpreted and made with a circle of equal stars, another circle with one star in the center, and various designs of even or alternate horizontal rows of stars, even the \"[[Bennington flag]]\" from [[Bennington, Vermont]] which had the number \"76\" surmounted by an arch of 13 stars, later also becoming known in 1976 as the \"Bicentennial Flag\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lljc&fileName=008/lljc008.db&recNum=90|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> \n\nThe combined crosses in the British Union flag symbolized the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The symbolism of a union of equal parts was retained in the [[Flag of the United States#The Flag Resolution of 1777|new U.S. flag]], as described in the Flag Resolution of June 14, 1777 (later celebrated in U.S. culture and history as \"[[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]]\").\n\n==In fiction==\n\n[[File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg|thumb|right|upright|Versions of the Grand Union Flag in alternate histories may be modified so that the Union Jack in the canton also represents Ireland.]]\n\nIn some alternate history fictions set in realities where the American Revolutionary War was either averted or won by Great Britain, the Grand Union Flag has been depicted as the flag of a North American nation within the British Empire.\n\nIn ''[[For Want of a Nail (novel)|For Want of a Nail]]'' by [[Robert Sobel]], it serves as the flag of the Confederation of North America, a self-governing dominion created in 1843 via the second of two Britannic Designs after [[John Burgoyne]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, resulting in the Conciliationists gaining control of the [[Continental Congress]] in 1778.\n\nIn ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], it serves as the flag for the North American Union and is commonly referred to as the 'Jack and Stripes'. A modified version of the flag used by the separatist Independence Party and the nativist terrorist organisation the Sons of Liberty replaces the Union Jack with a [[bald eagle]] on a blue field.\n\nIn the ''[[Sliders]]'' episode ''Prince of Wails'', set in a reality where the American Revolution was successfully suppressed, it serves as the flag of the British States of America, a heavily-taxed and dictatorially-governed corner of the British Empire (albeit without the knowledge of the King, Harold III).\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Heraldry}}\n*[[George Rex Flag]]\n*[[Flag of New England]]\n*[[Flag of Hawaii]]\n*[[Betsy Ross flag]]\n*[[Flag of the East India Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | last = Ansoff | first = Peter | year = 2006 | title = The Flag on Prospect Hill | journal = Raven: A Journal of Vexillology | volume = 13 | pages = 77\u2013100 | ISSN = 1071-0043 | LCCN = 94642220}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Fawcett | first = Charles |date=October 1937 | newspaper = Mariners Mirror  | url = http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-eic2.html | title = The Striped Flag of the East India Company, and its Connexion with the American \u2018Stars and Stripes\u2019}}.\n* Hamilton, Schuyler.

(The UK flag added [[St. Patrick's Saltire]].)\n\n==History==\n[[File:Grand-Union-Flag.jpg|upright|thumb|A replica flag flying outside [[San Francisco City Hall]], [[San Francisco, California]]]]\n[[File:1885 History of US flags med.jpg|upright|thumb|\"First National Flag\", School Text: ''\"A Brief History of the United States\"'', 1880]]\n[[File:Colonial-Red-Ensign.svg|upright|thumb|The design for the flag was based in part on the [[red ensign]] then used by British colonies.]]\n\nBy the end of 1775, during the first year of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] operated as a ''[[de facto]]'' war government authorizing the creation of the [[Continental Army]], the [[Continental Navy]], and even a small contingent of [[Continental Marines]]. A new flag was needed to represent the Congress and fledgling nation (initially the [[Thirteen Colonies|United Colonies]]) with a banner distinct from the British [[Red Ensign]] flown from civilian and merchant vessels, the [[White Ensign]] of the British [[Royal Navy]], and the British union flags carried on land by the British army. The emerging states had been using their own independent flags, with Massachusetts using the [[Taunton Flag]], and New York using the [[George Rex Flag]], prior to the adoption of united colors.\n\nAmericans first hoisted the Colors on the colonial warship {{USS|Alfred|1774|2}}, in the harbor on the western shore of the [[Delaware River]] at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on December 3, 1775, by newly appointed Lieutenant [[John Paul Jones]] of the formative [[Continental Navy]]. The event had been documented in letters to Congress and in eyewitness accounts.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Virginia | url = http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=DelVol02.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=537&division=div1#n537.1 | title = Letters of delegates to Congress, 1774\u20131789 | volume = 2, September\u2013December 1775 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110112113342/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=DelVol02.xml&images=images%2Fmodeng&data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&tag=public&part=537&division=div1#n537.1 | archivedate = 2011-01-12 }},</ref> The flag was used by the [[Continental Army]] forces as both a naval [[ensign]] and garrison flag throughout 1776 and early 1777.\n\nIt is not known for certain when or by whom the design of the Continental Colors was created, but the flag could easily be produced by sewing white stripes onto the British [[Red Ensign]]s.{{Sfn | Ansoff | 2006}} The ''\"Alfred\"'' flag has been credited to [[Margaret Manny]].{{Sfn | Leepson | 2004 | p = 51}}\n\nIt was widely believed that the flag was raised by [[George Washington]]'s army on New Year's Day, 1776, at [[Prospect Hill Monument|Prospect Hill]] in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] (now part of [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]), near his headquarters at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], (across the [[Charles River]] to the north from [[Boston]]), which was then surrounding and laying siege to the British forces then occupying the city, and that the flag was interpreted by British military observers in the city under commanding General [[Thomas Gage]], as a sign of surrender.{{Sfn | Preble | 1880 | p = 218}}<ref>{{cite web |title=A Short History of the American Flag |publisher=What So Proudly We Hail |url=https://www.whatsoproudlywehail.org/curriculum/the-american-calendar/a-short-history-of-the-american-flag |accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref> Some scholars dispute the traditional account and conclude that the flag raised at Prospect Hill was probably a British [[union flag]],{{Sfn | Ansoff | 2006}} though subsequent research supports the contrary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Research upholds traditional Prospect Hill flag story|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/somerville/research-upholds-traditional-prospect-hill-flag-story|accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe flag has had several names, at least five of which have been popularly remembered. The more recent moniker, \"Grand Union Flag\", was first applied in the 19th-century [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] by [[George Henry Preble]], in his 1872 ''History of the American Flag''.{{Sfn | Ansoff | 2006}}\n\nThe design of the Colors is strikingly similar to [[Flag of the East India Company|the flag of the British East India Company]] (EIC). Indeed, certain EIC designs in use since 1707 (when the canton was changed from the [[flag of England]] to that of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]) were nearly identical, but the number of stripes varied from 9 to 15. That EIC flags could be well have been known by the American colonists has been the basis of a theory of the origin of the national flag's design.{{Sfn | Fawcett | 1937}} \n\nVexillologist Nick Groom proposed the theory that the Grand Union was adopted by George Washington's army as a protest against the rule of the British Parliament but a profession of continued loyalty towards [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Groom, Nick,|first=|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/224734058|title=The Union Jack : the story of the British flag|date=2017|publisher=Atlantic Books|year=|isbn=1-84354-336-2|location=London|pages=187|oclc=224734058}}</ref> Groom argues that the inclusion of the Union Jack in the canton of the Grand Union is evidence of this sentiment.\n\nThe Grand Union became obsolete following the passing of the [[Flag Acts (United States)|Flag Act of 1777]] by the Continental Congress which authorized a new official national flag of a design similar to that of the Colors, with thirteen stars (representing [[Thirteen Colonies|the thirteen States]]) on a field of blue replacing the British Union Flag in the canton. The resolution describes only \"a new constellation\" for the arrangement of the white stars in the blue canton so a number of designs were later interpreted and made with a circle of equal stars, another circle with one star in the center, and various designs of even or alternate horizontal rows of stars, even the \"[[Bennington flag]]\" from [[Bennington, Vermont]] which had the number \"76\" surmounted by an arch of 13 stars, later also becoming known in 1976 as the \"Bicentennial Flag\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=lljc&fileName=008/lljc008.db&recNum=90|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> \n\nThe combined crosses in the British Union flag symbolized the union of the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The symbolism of a union of equal parts was retained in the [[Flag of the United States#The Flag Resolution of 1777|new U.S. flag]], as described in the Flag Resolution of June 14, 1777 (later celebrated in U.S. culture and history as \"[[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]]\").\n\n==In fiction==\n\n[[File:Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg|thumb|right|upright|Versions of the Grand Union Flag in alternate histories may be modified so that the Union Jack in the canton also represents Ireland.]]\n\nIn some alternate history fictions set in realities where the American Revolutionary War was either averted or won by Great Britain, the Grand Union Flag has been depicted as the flag of a North American nation within the British Empire.\n\nIn ''[[For Want of a Nail (novel)|For Want of a Nail]]'' by [[Robert Sobel]], it serves as the flag of the Confederation of North America, a self-governing dominion created in 1843 via the second of two Britannic Designs after [[John Burgoyne]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in October 1777, resulting in the Conciliationists gaining control of the [[Continental Congress]] in 1778.\n\nIn ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], it serves as the flag for the North American Union and is commonly referred to as the 'Jack and Stripes'. A modified version of the flag used by the separatist Independence Party and the nativist terrorist organisation the Sons of Liberty replaces the Union Jack with a [[bald eagle]] on a blue field.\n\nIn the ''[[Sliders]]'' episode ''Prince of Wails'', set in a reality where the American Revolution was successfully suppressed, it serves as the flag of the British States of America, a heavily-taxed and dictatorially-governed corner of the British Empire (albeit without the knowledge of the King, Harold III).\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Heraldry}}\n*[[George Rex Flag]]\n*[[Flag of New England]]\n*[[Flag of Hawaii]]\n*[[Betsy Ross flag]]\n*[[Flag of the East India Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | last = Ansoff | first = Peter | year = 2006 | title = The Flag on Prospect Hill | journal = Raven: A Journal of Vexillology | volume = 13 | pages = 77\u2013100 | ISSN = 1071-0043 | LCCN = 94642220}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Fawcett | first = Charles |date=October 1937 | newspaper = Mariners Mirror  | url = http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-eic2.html | title = The Striped Flag of the East India Company, and its Connexion with the American \u2018Stars and Stripes\u2019}}.\n* Hamilton, Schuyler.
