The movement of dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as ''glide'' or [[Slip (materials science) |slip]]. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a ''glide dislocation'' but the atoms on one side have moved by one position. The crystalline order is not fully restored with a ''partial dislocation''. A dislocation defines the boundary between ''slipped'' and ''unslipped'' regions of material and as a result, must either form a complete loop or extend to the edges of the crystal.<ref name=\"hull01\">{{cite book |first1=D. |last1=Hull |first2=D.

The two main types of mobile dislocations are ''edge'' and ''screw '' dislocations. \n\nEdge dislocations can be visualized as being caused by the termination of a plane of [[atom]]s in the middle of a [[crystal]]. In such a case, the surrounding [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. This phenomenon is analogous to half of a piece of paper inserted into a stack of paper, where the defect in the stack is noticeable only at the edge of the half sheet.\n\nThe theory describing the elastic fields of the defects was originally developed by [[Vito Volterra]] in 1907.

Taylor}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1930s, one of the enduring challenges of materials science was to explain [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in microscopic terms. A simplistic attempt to calculate the [[shear stress]] at which neighbouring atomic planes ''slip'' over each other in a perfect crystal suggests that, for a material with [[shear modulus]] <math>G</math>, shear strength <math>\\tau_m</math> is given approximately by:\n\n::<math> \\tau_m = \\frac {G} {2 \\pi}.</math>\n\nThe shear modulus in [[metal]]s is typically within the range 20 000 to 150 000 [[MPa]] indicating a predicted shear stress of 3 000 to 24 000 MPa. This was difficult to reconcile with measured shear stresses in the range of 0.5 to 10 MPa.\n\nIn 1934, [[Egon Orowan]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]], independently proposed that plastic deformation could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations. Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge. In effect, a half plane of atoms is moved in response to shear stress by breaking and reforming a line of bonds, one (or a few) at a time. The energy required to break a row of bonds is far less than that required to break all the bonds on an entire plane of atoms at once. Even this simple model of the force required to move a dislocation shows that plasticity is possible at much lower stresses than in a perfect crystal. In many materials, particularly ductile materials, dislocations are the \"carrier\" of plastic deformation, and the energy required to move them is less than the energy required to fracture the material. \n\n== Mechanisms ==\nA dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure which contains an abrupt change in the arrangement of atoms. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a dislocation but the atoms on one side have moved or slipped. Dislocations define the boundary between slipped and unslipped regions of material and cannot end within a lattice and must either extend to a free edge or form a loop within the crystal.<ref name=\"hull01\"/> A dislocation can be characterised by the distance and direction of movement it causes to atoms in the lattice which is called the Burgers vector. The Burgers vector of a dislocation remains constant even though the shape of the dislocation may change.\n\nA variety of dislocation types exist, with mobile dislocations known as ''glissile'' and immobile dislocations called ''sessile''. The movement of mobile dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as glide or slip. The movement of dislocations may be enhanced or hindered by the presence other elements within the crystal and over time, these elements may diffuse to the dislocation forming a [[Cottrell atmosphere]]. The pinning and breakaway from these elements explains some of the unusual yielding behavior seen with steels. The interaction of hydrogen with dislocations is one of the mechanisms proposed to explain [[hydrogen embrittlement]].\n\nDislocations behave as though they are a distinct entity within a crystalline material where some types of dislocation can move through the material bending, flexing and changing shape and interacting with other dislocations and features within the crystal. Dislocations are generated by deforming a crystalline material such as metals, which can cause them to initiate from surfaces, particularly at [[stress concentrations]] or within the material at defects and [[grain boundaries]]. The number and arrangement of dislocations give rise to many of the properties of metals such as [[ductility]], [[hardness]] and [[yield strength]]. [[Heat treating |Heat treatment]], [[alloy]] content and [[cold working]] can change the number and arrangement of the dislocation population and how they move and interact in order to create useful properties.\n\n[[File:Simulation of dislocations in aluminium.webm|thumb|Simulation of dislocations in aluminium. Only non-crystalline atoms are shown.]]\n\n=== Generating dislocations ===\nWhen metals are subjected to [[cold forming|cold working]] (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low as compared to the material's absolute melting temperature, <math>T_m</math> i.e., typically less than <math>0.4T_m</math>) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new dislocations. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as [[strain hardening]] or work hardening. \n\nDislocation density <math>\\rho</math> in a material can be increased by plastic deformation by the following relationship: \n\n::<math>\\tau \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}</math>.\n\nSince the dislocation density increases with plastic deformation, a mechanism for the creation of dislocations must be activated in the material.  Three mechanisms for dislocation formation are homogeneous nucleation, grain boundary initiation, and interfaces between the lattice and the surface, precipitates, dispersed phases, or reinforcing fibers.\n\n==== Homogeneous nucleation ====\nThe creation of a dislocation by ''homogeneous nucleation'' is a result of the rupture of the atomic bonds along a line in the lattice.  A plane in the lattice is sheared, resulting in 2 oppositely faced half planes or dislocations.  These dislocations move away from each other through the lattice.  Since homogeneous nucleation forms dislocations from perfect crystals and requires the simultaneous breaking of many bonds, the energy required for homogeneous nucleation is high.  For instance, the stress required for homogeneous nucleation in copper has been shown to be <math> \\frac {\\tau_{\\text{hom}}}{G}=7.4\\times10^{-2}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the shear modulus of copper (46 GPa).  Solving for <math>\\tau_{\\text{hom}} \\,\\!</math>, we see that the required stress is 3.4 GPa, which is very close to the theoretical strength of the crystal.  Therefore, in conventional deformation homogeneous nucleation requires a concentrated stress, and is very unlikely.  Grain boundary initiation and interface interaction are more common sources of dislocations.\n\nIrregularities at the grain boundaries in materials can produce dislocations which propagate into the grain.  The steps and ledges at the grain boundary are an important source of dislocations in the early stages of plastic deformation.\n\n==== Frank\u2013Read source ====\nThe [[Frank\u2013Read source]] is a mechanism that is able to produce a stream of dislocations from a pinned segment of a dislocation. Stress bows the dislocation segment, expanding until it creates a dislocation loop that breaks free from the source.\n\n==== Surfaces ====\nThe surface of a crystal can produce dislocations in the crystal.  Due to the small steps on the surface of most crystals, stress in some regions on the surface is much larger than the average stress in the lattice.  This stress leads to dislocations.  The dislocations are then propagated into the lattice in the same manner as in grain boundary initiation.  In single crystals, the majority of dislocations are formed at the surface.  The dislocation density 200 micrometres into the surface of a material has been shown to be six times higher than the density in the bulk.  However, in polycrystalline materials the surface sources do not have a major effect because most grains are not in contact with the surface.\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nThe interface between a metal and an oxide can greatly increase the number of dislocations created.  The oxide layer puts the surface of the metal in tension because the oxygen atoms squeeze into the lattice, and the oxygen atoms are under compression.  This greatly increases the stress on the surface of the metal and consequently the amount of dislocations formed at the surface.  The increased amount of stress on the surface steps results in an increase in dislocations formed and emitted from the interface.<ref>[[Marc A. Meyers|Marc Andr\u00e9 Meyers]], Krishan Kumar Chawla (1999) ''Mechanical Behaviors of Materials.''

This occurs when the lattice spacing of the two crystals do not match, resulting in a misfit of the lattices at the interface. The stress caused by the lattice misfit is released by forming regularly spaced misfit dislocations. Misfit dislocations are edge dislocations with the dislocation line in the interface plane and the Burgers vector in the direction of the interface normal. Interfaces with misfit dislocations may form e.g. as a result of [[Epitaxy|epitaxial crystal growth]] on a substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schober|first=T.|last2=Balluffi|first2=R.

In most metals, prismatic dislocation loops are the energetically most preferred clusters of self-interstitial atoms.\n\n=== Interaction and arrangement ===\n==== Geometrically necessary dislocations ====\n[[Geometrically necessary dislocations]] are arrangements of dislocations that can accommodate a limited degree of plastic bending in a crystalline material.\nTangles of dislocations are found at the early stage of deformation and appear as non well-defined boundaries; the process of dynamic [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] leads eventually to the formation of a cellular structure containing boundaries with misorientation lower than 15\u00b0 (low angle grain boundaries). \n\n==== Pinning ====\nAdding pinning points that inhibit the motion of dislocations, such as alloying elements, can introduce stress fields that ultimately strengthen the material by requiring a higher applied stress to overcome the pinning stress and continue dislocation motion.\n\nThe effects of strain hardening by accumulation of dislocations and the grain structure formed at high strain can be removed by appropriate heat treatment ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) which promotes the [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and subsequent [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] of the material.\n\nThe combined processing techniques of work hardening and [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] allow for control over dislocation density, the degree of dislocation entanglement, and ultimately the [[yield strength]] of the material.\n\n==== Persistent slip bands ====\nRepeated cycling of a material can lead to the generation and bunching of dislocations surrounded by regions that are relatively dislocation free. This pattern forms a ladder like structure known as a ''persistent slip band'' (PSB).<ref name=\"suresh04\">{{cite book |last1=Suresh |first1=S. |year=2004  |title=Fatigue of Materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57046-6}}</ref> PSB's are so-called, because they leave marks on the surface of metals that even when removed by polishing, return at the same place with continued cycling.\n\nPSB walls are predominately made up of edge dislocations.

For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is one plane in which the dislocation can slip.\n\n==== Climb ====\n''Dislocation climb'' is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane. The driving force for dislocation climb is the movement of vacancies through a crystal lattice.  If a vacancy moves next to the boundary of the extra half plane of atoms that forms an edge dislocation, the atom in the half plane closest to the vacancy can ''jump'' and fill the vacancy.  This atom shift ''moves'' the vacancy in line with the half plane of atoms, causing a shift, or positive climb, of the dislocation.  The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb.  Since dislocation climb results from individual atoms ''jumping'' into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.\n\nDuring positive climb, the crystal shrinks in the direction perpendicular to the extra half plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from the half plane.  Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms to the half plane, the crystal grows in the direction perpendicular to the half plane.  Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular to the half plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb.  This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.\n\nOne additional difference between dislocation slip and climb is the temperature dependence.  Climb occurs much more rapidly at high temperatures than low temperatures due to an increase in vacancy motion.  Slip, on the other hand, has only a small dependence on temperature.\n\n==== Dislocation avalanches ====\n[[Dislocation avalanches]] occur when multiple simultaneous movement of dislocations occur.\n\n==Geometry==\nTwo main types of mobile dislocations exist: edge and screw. Dislocations found in real materials are typically ''mixed'', meaning that they have characteristics of both.\n\n===Edge===\n[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.svg|right|thumb|Schematic diagram (lattice planes) showing an edge dislocation. Burgers vector in black, dislocation line in blue.]]\n\nA crystalline material consists of a regular array of atoms, arranged into lattice planes. An edge dislocation is a defect where an extra half-plane of atoms is introduced midway through the crystal, distorting nearby planes of atoms. When enough force is applied from one side of the crystal structure, this extra plane passes through planes of atoms breaking and joining bonds with them until it reaches the grain boundary.  The dislocation has two properties, a line direction, which is the direction running along the bottom of the extra half plane, and the [[Burgers vector]] which describes the magnitude and direction of distortion to the lattice. In an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line direction.\n\nThe stresses caused by an edge dislocation are complex due to its inherent asymmetry. These stresses are described by three equations:<ref name=\"rhill\">{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Reed-Hill|first2=Reza|last2=Abbaschian|date=1994|title=Physical Metallurgy Principles|location=Boston|publisher=PWS Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-92173-6}}</ref>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(3x^2 +y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{xy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {x(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the [[Burgers vector]], <math>\\nu</math> is [[Poisson's ratio]] and <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are coordinates.\n\nThese equations suggest a vertically oriented dumbbell of stresses surrounding the dislocation, with compression experienced by the atoms near the \"extra\" plane, and tension experienced by those atoms near the \"missing\" plane.<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n===Screw===\n[[Image:Vector de Burgers.PNG|thumb|Top right: edge dislocation.<br>Bottom right: screw dislocation.]]\n\nA ''screw dislocation'' can be visualized by cutting a crystal along a plane and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves fitting back together without leaving a defect. If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a screw dislocation. It comprises a structure in which a [[Helix|helical]] path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Shackelford|title=Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-601260-3|pages=110\u201311|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\nThe stresses caused by a screw dislocation are less complex than those of an edge dislocation and need only one equation, as symmetry allows one radial coordinate to be used:<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{r} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi r} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the Burgers vector, and <math>r</math> is a radial coordinate.\nThis equation suggests a long cylinder of stress radiating outward from the cylinder and decreasing with distance. This simple model results in an infinite value for the core of the dislocation at <math>r=0</math> and so it is only valid for stresses outside of the core of the dislocation.<ref name=\"rhill\"/> If the Burgers vector is very large, the core may actually be empty resulting in a [[micropipe]], as commonly observed in [[silicon carbide]].\n\n===Mixed===\nIn many materials, dislocations are found where the line direction and Burgers vector are neither perpendicular nor parallel and these dislocations are called ''mixed dislocations'', consisting of both screw and edge character. They are characterized by  <math>\\varphi</math>, the angle between the line direction and Burgers vector, where <math>\\varphi=\\pi/2</math> for pure edge dislocations and  <math>\\varphi=0</math> for screw dislocations.\n\n===Partial===\n[[Partial dislocations]] leave behind a stacking fault. Two types of partial dislocation are the ''Frank partial dislocation'' which is sessile and the ''Shockley partial dislocation'' which is glissile.<ref name=\"radwan\"/> \n\nA Frank partial dislocation is formed by inserting or removing a layer of atoms on the {111} plane which is then bounded by the Frank partial. Removal of a close packed layer is known as an ''intrinsic'' stacking fault and inserting a layer is known as an ''extrinsic'' stacking fault. The Burgers vector is normal to the {111} glide plane so the dislocation cannot glide and can only move through ''climb''.<ref name=\"hull01\"/>\n\nIn order to lower the overall energy of the lattice, edge and screw dislocations typically disassociate into a [[stacking fault]] bounded by two Shockley partial dislocations.<ref name=F\u00f6ll>{{cite web|title=Defects in Crystals|first=Helmut|last=F\u00f6ll|url=http://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu/MatSE584/index.html |access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The width of this stacking-fault region is proportional to the [[stacking-fault energy]] of the material. The combined effect is known as an ''extended dislocation'' and is able to glide as a unit. However, dissociated screw dislocations must recombine before they can [[cross slip]], making it difficult for these dislocations to move around barriers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stacking Fault Energy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/stacking-fault-energy|website=Science Direct|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Materials with low stacking-fault energies have the greatest dislocation dissociation and are therefore more readily cold worked.\n\n=== Stair-rod and the Lomer\u2013Cottrell junction ===\nIf two glide dislocations that lie on different {111} planes split into Shockley partials and intersect, they will produce a stair-rod dislocation with a [[Lomer-Cottrell junction |Lomer-Cottrell dislocation]] at its apex.<ref> {{cite web |title=Reaction Forming a Stair-Rod Dislocation |url=https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_5/illustr/i5_4_2.html |access-date=26 Nov 2019}}</ref> It is called a ''stair-rod'' because it is analogous to the rod that keeps carpet in-place on a stair.\n\n=== Jog ===\n[[File:Jog-Kink.gif|thumb|right|Geometrical differences between jogs and kinks]]\nA '''Jog''' describes the steps of a dislocation line that are not in the [[glide plane]] of a [[crystal structure]].<ref name=F\u00f6ll/> A dislocation line is rarely uniformly straight, often containing many curves and steps that can impede or facilitate dislocation movement by acting as pinpoints or nucleation points respectively. Because jogs are out of the glide plane, under shear they cannot move by glide (movement along the glide plane). They instead must rely on vacancy diffusion facilitated climb to move through the lattice.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.|last1=Cai|first2=W. D.|last2=Nix|title=Imperfections in crystalline solids|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016}}</ref>. Away from the melting point of a material, vacancy diffusion is a slow process, so jogs act as immobile barriers at room temperature for most metals.<ref name=\"courtney00\">{{cite book|first=T. H.|last=Courtney|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|location=Long Grove, IL|publisher=Waveland|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nJogs typically form when two non-parallel dislocations cross during slip. The presence of jogs in a material increases its [[yield strength]] by preventing easy glide of dislocations. A pair of immobile jogs in a dislocation will act as a [[Frank\u2013Read source]] under shear, increasing the overall dislocation density of a material.<ref name=\"courtney00\" /> When a material's yield strength is increased via dislocation density increase, particularly when done by mechanical work, it is called [[work hardening]]. At high temperatures, vacancy facilitated movement of jogs becomes a much faster process, diminishing their overall effectiveness in impeding dislocation movement.\n\n=== Kink ===\n[[Kink (dislocation)|Kinks]] are steps in a dislocation line parallel to glide planes. Unlike jogs, they facilitate glide by acting as a nucleation point for dislocation movement. The lateral spreading of a kink from the nucleation point allows for forward propagation of the dislocation while only moving a few atoms at a time, reducing the overall energy barrier to slip.\n\n== Example in two dimensions (2D) ==\n\n[[File:Dislokation Dissoziation.svg|thumb|Dissociation of a pair of dislocations due to shearing (red arrows) of an hexagonal crystal in 2D.

They can only be created in pairs with antiparallel [[Burgers_vector |Burgers vector]]. If a lot of dislocations are e.&nbsp;g. thermally excited, the discrete translational order of the crystal is destroyed. Simultaneously, the [[shear modulus]] and the [[Young's modulus]] disappear, which implies that the crystal is molten to a fluid phase. The orientational order is not yet destroyed (as indicated by lattice lines in one direction) and one finds - very similar to liquid crystals - a fluid phase with typically a six-folded director field. This so-called [[hexatic phase]] still has an orientational stiffness.

The [[electron]] beam undergoes [[diffraction]] by the regular crystal lattice planes into a diffraction pattern and contrast is generated in the image by this diffraction (as well as by thickness variations, varying strain, and other mechanisms). Dislocations have different local atomic structure and produce a strain field, and therefore will cause the electrons in the microscope to scatter in different ways. Note the characteristic 'wiggly' contrast of the dislocation lines as they pass through the thickness of the material in the figure (also note that dislocations cannot end in a crystal, and these dislocations are terminating at the surfaces since the image is a 2D projection).\n\nDislocations do not have random structures, the local atomic structure of a dislocation is determined by the Burgers vector. One very useful application of the TEM in dislocation imaging is the ability to experimentally determine the Burgers vector. Determination of the Burgers vector is achieved by what is known as <math>\\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{b}</math> (\"g dot b\") analysis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transmission electron microscopy : a textbook for materials science|first=David B. |last=Williams |first2=C.

The vector in the diffraction pattern from the transmitted spot to the diffracted spot is the <math>\\vec{g}</math> vector. The contrast of a dislocation is scaled by a factor of the dot product of this vector and the Burgers vector (<math>\\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{b}</math>). As a result, if the Burgers vector and <math>\\vec{g}</math> vector are perpendicular, there will be no signal from the dislocation and the dislocation will not appear at all in the image. Therefore, by examining different dark field images formed from spots with different g vectors, the Burgers vector can be determined.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[Image:Silicon_dislocation_orientation_111_mag_500x.png|right|thumb|Etch Pits formed on the ends of dislocations in silicon, orientation (111)]]\n\n[[Field ion microscopy]] and [[atom probe]] techniques offer methods of producing much higher magnifications (typically 3 million times and above) and permit the observation of dislocations at an atomic level. Where surface relief can be resolved to the level of an atomic step, screw dislocations appear as distinctive spiral features \u2013 thus revealing an important mechanism of crystal growth: where there is a surface step, atoms can more easily add to the crystal, and the surface step associated with a screw dislocation is never destroyed no matter how many atoms are added to it.\n\n==== Chemical etching ====\nWhen a dislocation line intersects the surface of a metallic material, the associated strain field locally increases the relative susceptibility of the material to acid [[industrial etching|etching]] and an [[etch pit density|etch pit]] of regular geometrical format results. In this way, dislocations in silicon, for example, can be observed ''indirectly'' using an interference microscope. Crystal orientation can be determined by the shape of the etch pits associated with the dislocations.\n\nIf the material is deformed and repeatedly re-etched, a series of etch pits can be produced which effectively trace the movement of the dislocation in question.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|dislocation}}\n{{Commons category|Dislocations in crystals}}\n* [http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/index.html Defects in Crystals/ Prof. Dr. Helmut F\u00f6ll website] Chapter 5 contains a wealth of information on dislocations;\n* [http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/dislocations/ DoITPoMS] Online tutorial on dislocations, including movies of dislocations in [[bubble raft]]s;\n* [https://www.enggstudy.com/2019/10/difference-between-edge-dislocation-and-screw-dislocation.html Difference between Edge dislocation and Screw dislocation] Difference between Edge dislocation and Screw dislocation in detail;\n* [http://www.iap.tuwien.ac.at/www/surface/STM_Gallery/ Scanning Tunneling Microscope \u2013 Gallery] Image gallery, including a dislocations page, seen at the atomic level of metal surfaces, by the surface physics group at the Faculty of Physics, Vienna University of Technology, Austria.\n* [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/volterra_-_equilibrium_of_multiply_connected_bodies.pdf Volterra, V., \"On the equilibrium of multiply-connected bodies,\" trans. by D.

The two main types of mobile dislocations are ''edge'' and ''screw '' dislocations. \n\nEdge dislocations can be visualized as being caused by the termination of a plane of [[atom]]s in the middle of a [[crystal]]. In such a case, the surrounding [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. This phenomenon is analogous to half of a piece of paper inserted into a stack of paper, where the defect in the stack is noticeable only at the edge of the half sheet.\n\nThe theory describing the elastic fields of the defects was originally developed by [[Vito Volterra]] in 1907.

Taylor}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1930s, one of the enduring challenges of materials science was to explain [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in microscopic terms. A simplistic attempt to calculate the [[shear stress]] at which neighbouring atomic planes ''slip'' over each other in a perfect crystal suggests that, for a material with [[shear modulus]] <math>G</math>, shear strength <math>\\tau_m</math> is given approximately by:\n\n::<math> \\tau_m = \\frac {G} {2 \\pi}.</math>\n\nThe shear modulus in [[metal]]s is typically within the range 20 000 to 150 000 [[MPa]] indicating a predicted shear stress of 3 000 to 24 000 MPa. This was difficult to reconcile with measured shear stresses in the range of 0.5 to 10 MPa.\n\nIn 1934, [[Egon Orowan]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]], independently proposed that plastic deformation could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations. Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge. In effect, a half plane of atoms is moved in response to shear stress by breaking and reforming a line of bonds, one (or a few) at a time. The energy required to break a row of bonds is far less than that required to break all the bonds on an entire plane of atoms at once. Even this simple model of the force required to move a dislocation shows that plasticity is possible at much lower stresses than in a perfect crystal. In many materials, particularly ductile materials, dislocations are the \"carrier\" of plastic deformation, and the energy required to move them is less than the energy required to fracture the material. \n\n== Mechanisms ==\nA dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure which contains an abrupt change in the arrangement of atoms. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a dislocation but the atoms on one side have moved or slipped. Dislocations define the boundary between slipped and unslipped regions of material and cannot end within a lattice and must either extend to a free edge or form a loop within the crystal.<ref name=\"hull01\"/> A dislocation can be characterised by the distance and direction of movement it causes to atoms in the lattice which is called the Burgers vector. The Burgers vector of a dislocation remains constant even though the shape of the dislocation may change.\n\nA variety of dislocation types exist, with mobile dislocations known as ''glissile'' and immobile dislocations called ''sessile''. The movement of mobile dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as glide or slip. The movement of dislocations may be enhanced or hindered by the presence other elements within the crystal and over time, these elements may diffuse to the dislocation forming a [[Cottrell atmosphere]]. The pinning and breakaway from these elements explains some of the unusual yielding behavior seen with steels. The interaction of hydrogen with dislocations is one of the mechanisms proposed to explain [[hydrogen embrittlement]].\n\nDislocations behave as though they are a distinct entity within a crystalline material where some types of dislocation can move through the material bending, flexing and changing shape and interacting with other dislocations and features within the crystal. Dislocations are generated by deforming a crystalline material such as metals, which can cause them to initiate from surfaces, particularly at [[stress concentrations]] or within the material at defects and [[grain boundaries]]. The number and arrangement of dislocations give rise to many of the properties of metals such as [[ductility]], [[hardness]] and [[yield strength]]. [[Heat treating |Heat treatment]], [[alloy]] content and [[cold working]] can change the number and arrangement of the dislocation population and how they move and interact in order to create useful properties.\n\n[[File:Simulation of dislocations in aluminium.webm|thumb|Simulation of dislocations in aluminium. Only non-crystalline atoms are shown.]]\n\n=== Generating dislocations ===\nWhen metals are subjected to [[cold forming|cold working]] (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low as compared to the material's absolute melting temperature, <math>T_m</math> i.e., typically less than <math>0.4T_m</math>) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new dislocations. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as [[strain hardening]] or work hardening. \n\nDislocation density <math>\\rho</math> in a material can be increased by plastic deformation by the following relationship: \n\n::<math>\\tau \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}</math>.\n\nSince the dislocation density increases with plastic deformation, a mechanism for the creation of dislocations must be activated in the material.  Three mechanisms for dislocation formation are homogeneous nucleation, grain boundary initiation, and interfaces between the lattice and the surface, precipitates, dispersed phases, or reinforcing fibers.\n\n==== Homogeneous nucleation ====\nThe creation of a dislocation by ''homogeneous nucleation'' is a result of the rupture of the atomic bonds along a line in the lattice.  A plane in the lattice is sheared, resulting in 2 oppositely faced half planes or dislocations.  These dislocations move away from each other through the lattice.  Since homogeneous nucleation forms dislocations from perfect crystals and requires the simultaneous breaking of many bonds, the energy required for homogeneous nucleation is high.  For instance, the stress required for homogeneous nucleation in copper has been shown to be <math> \\frac {\\tau_{\\text{hom}}}{G}=7.4\\times10^{-2}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the shear modulus of copper (46 GPa).  Solving for <math>\\tau_{\\text{hom}} \\,\\!</math>, we see that the required stress is 3.4 GPa, which is very close to the theoretical strength of the crystal.  Therefore, in conventional deformation homogeneous nucleation requires a concentrated stress, and is very unlikely.  Grain boundary initiation and interface interaction are more common sources of dislocations.\n\nIrregularities at the grain boundaries in materials can produce dislocations which propagate into the grain.  The steps and ledges at the grain boundary are an important source of dislocations in the early stages of plastic deformation.\n\n==== Frank\u2013Read source ====\nThe [[Frank\u2013Read source]] is a mechanism that is able to produce a stream of dislocations from a pinned segment of a dislocation. Stress bows the dislocation segment, expanding until it creates a dislocation loop that breaks free from the source.\n\n==== Surfaces ====\nThe surface of a crystal can produce dislocations in the crystal.  Due to the small steps on the surface of most crystals, stress in some regions on the surface is much larger than the average stress in the lattice.  This stress leads to dislocations.  The dislocations are then propagated into the lattice in the same manner as in grain boundary initiation.  In single crystals, the majority of dislocations are formed at the surface.  The dislocation density 200 micrometres into the surface of a material has been shown to be six times higher than the density in the bulk.  However, in polycrystalline materials the surface sources do not have a major effect because most grains are not in contact with the surface.\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nThe interface between a metal and an oxide can greatly increase the number of dislocations created.  The oxide layer puts the surface of the metal in tension because the oxygen atoms squeeze into the lattice, and the oxygen atoms are under compression.  This greatly increases the stress on the surface of the metal and consequently the amount of dislocations formed at the surface.  The increased amount of stress on the surface steps results in an increase in dislocations formed and emitted from the interface.<ref>[[Marc A. Meyers|Marc Andr\u00e9 Meyers]], Krishan Kumar Chawla (1999) ''Mechanical Behaviors of Materials.''

This occurs when the lattice spacing of the two crystals do not match, resulting in a misfit of the lattices at the interface. The stress caused by the lattice misfit is released by forming regularly spaced misfit dislocations. Misfit dislocations are edge dislocations with the dislocation line in the interface plane and the Burgers vector in the direction of the interface normal. Interfaces with misfit dislocations may form e.g. as a result of [[Epitaxy|epitaxial crystal growth]] on a substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schober|first=T.|last2=Balluffi|first2=R.

In most metals, prismatic dislocation loops are the energetically most preferred clusters of self-interstitial atoms.\n\n=== Interaction and arrangement ===\n==== Geometrically necessary dislocations ====\n[[Geometrically necessary dislocations]] are arrangements of dislocations that can accommodate a limited degree of plastic bending in a crystalline material.\nTangles of dislocations are found at the early stage of deformation and appear as non well-defined boundaries; the process of dynamic [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] leads eventually to the formation of a cellular structure containing boundaries with misorientation lower than 15\u00b0 (low angle grain boundaries). \n\n==== Pinning ====\nAdding pinning points that inhibit the motion of dislocations, such as alloying elements, can introduce stress fields that ultimately strengthen the material by requiring a higher applied stress to overcome the pinning stress and continue dislocation motion.\n\nThe effects of strain hardening by accumulation of dislocations and the grain structure formed at high strain can be removed by appropriate heat treatment ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) which promotes the [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and subsequent [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] of the material.\n\nThe combined processing techniques of work hardening and [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] allow for control over dislocation density, the degree of dislocation entanglement, and ultimately the [[yield strength]] of the material.\n\n==== Persistent slip bands ====\nRepeated cycling of a material can lead to the generation and bunching of dislocations surrounded by regions that are relatively dislocation free. This pattern forms a ladder like structure known as a ''persistent slip band'' (PSB).<ref name=\"suresh04\">{{cite book |last1=Suresh |first1=S. |year=2004  |title=Fatigue of Materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57046-6}}</ref> PSB's are so-called, because they leave marks on the surface of metals that even when removed by polishing, return at the same place with continued cycling.\n\nPSB walls are predominately made up of edge dislocations.

For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is one plane in which the dislocation can slip.\n\n==== Climb ====\n''Dislocation climb'' is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane. The driving force for dislocation climb is the movement of vacancies through a crystal lattice.  If a vacancy moves next to the boundary of the extra half plane of atoms that forms an edge dislocation, the atom in the half plane closest to the vacancy can ''jump'' and fill the vacancy.  This atom shift ''moves'' the vacancy in line with the half plane of atoms, causing a shift, or positive climb, of the dislocation.  The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb.  Since dislocation climb results from individual atoms ''jumping'' into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.\n\nDuring positive climb, the crystal shrinks in the direction perpendicular to the extra half plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from the half plane.  Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms to the half plane, the crystal grows in the direction perpendicular to the half plane.  Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular to the half plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb.  This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.\n\nOne additional difference between dislocation slip and climb is the temperature dependence.  Climb occurs much more rapidly at high temperatures than low temperatures due to an increase in vacancy motion.  Slip, on the other hand, has only a small dependence on temperature.\n\n==== Dislocation avalanches ====\n[[Dislocation avalanches]] occur when multiple simultaneous movement of dislocations occur.\n\n==Geometry==\nTwo main types of mobile dislocations exist: edge and screw. Dislocations found in real materials are typically ''mixed'', meaning that they have characteristics of both.\n\n===Edge===\n[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.svg|right|thumb|Schematic diagram (lattice planes) showing an edge dislocation. Burgers vector in black, dislocation line in blue.]]\n\nA crystalline material consists of a regular array of atoms, arranged into lattice planes. An edge dislocation is a defect where an extra half-plane of atoms is introduced midway through the crystal, distorting nearby planes of atoms. When enough force is applied from one side of the crystal structure, this extra plane passes through planes of atoms breaking and joining bonds with them until it reaches the grain boundary.  The dislocation has two properties, a line direction, which is the direction running along the bottom of the extra half plane, and the [[Burgers vector]] which describes the magnitude and direction of distortion to the lattice. In an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line direction.\n\nThe stresses caused by an edge dislocation are complex due to its inherent asymmetry. These stresses are described by three equations:<ref name=\"rhill\">{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Reed-Hill|first2=Reza|last2=Abbaschian|date=1994|title=Physical Metallurgy Principles|location=Boston|publisher=PWS Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-92173-6}}</ref>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(3x^2 +y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{xy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {x(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the [[Burgers vector]], <math>\\nu</math> is [[Poisson's ratio]] and <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are coordinates.\n\nThese equations suggest a vertically oriented dumbbell of stresses surrounding the dislocation, with compression experienced by the atoms near the \"extra\" plane, and tension experienced by those atoms near the \"missing\" plane.<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n===Screw===\n[[Image:Vector de Burgers.PNG|thumb|Top right: edge dislocation.<br>Bottom right: screw dislocation.]]\n\nA ''screw dislocation'' can be visualized by cutting a crystal along a plane and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves fitting back together without leaving a defect. If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a screw dislocation. It comprises a structure in which a [[Helix|helical]] path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Shackelford|title=Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-601260-3|pages=110\u201311|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\nThe stresses caused by a screw dislocation are less complex than those of an edge dislocation and need only one equation, as symmetry allows one radial coordinate to be used:<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{r} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi r} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the Burgers vector, and <math>r</math> is a radial coordinate.\nThis equation suggests a long cylinder of stress radiating outward from the cylinder and decreasing with distance. This simple model results in an infinite value for the core of the dislocation at <math>r=0</math> and so it is only valid for stresses outside of the core of the dislocation.<ref name=\"rhill\"/> If the Burgers vector is very large, the core may actually be empty resulting in a [[micropipe]], as commonly observed in [[silicon carbide]].\n\n===Mixed===\nIn many materials, dislocations are found where the line direction and Burgers vector are neither perpendicular nor parallel and these dislocations are called ''mixed dislocations'', consisting of both screw and edge character.

Removal of a close packed layer is known as an ''intrinsic'' stacking fault and inserting a layer is known as an ''extrinsic'' stacking fault. The Burgers vector is normal to the {111} glide plane so the dislocation cannot glide and can only move through ''climb''.<ref name=\"hull01\"/>\n\nIn order to lower the overall energy of the lattice, edge and screw dislocations typically disassociate into a [[stacking fault]] bounded by two Shockley partial dislocations.<ref name=F\u00f6ll>{{cite web|title=Defects in Crystals|first=Helmut|last=F\u00f6ll|url=http://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu/MatSE584/index.html |access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The width of this stacking-fault region is proportional to the [[stacking-fault energy]] of the material. The combined effect is known as an ''extended dislocation'' and is able to glide as a unit. However, dissociated screw dislocations must recombine before they can [[cross slip]], making it difficult for these dislocations to move around barriers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stacking Fault Energy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/stacking-fault-energy|website=Science Direct|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Materials with low stacking-fault energies have the greatest dislocation dissociation and are therefore more readily cold worked.\n\n=== Stair-rod and the Lomer\u2013Cottrell junction ===\nIf two glide dislocations that lie on different {111} planes split into Shockley partials and intersect, they will produce a stair-rod dislocation with a [[Lomer-Cottrell junction |Lomer-Cottrell dislocation]] at its apex.<ref> {{cite web |title=Reaction Forming a Stair-Rod Dislocation |url=https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_5/illustr/i5_4_2.html |access-date=26 Nov 2019}}</ref> It is called a ''stair-rod'' because it is analogous to the rod that keeps carpet in-place on a stair.\n\n=== Jog ===\n[[File:Jog-Kink.gif|thumb|right|Geometrical differences between jogs and kinks]]\nA '''Jog''' describes the steps of a dislocation line that are not in the [[glide plane]] of a [[crystal structure]].<ref name=F\u00f6ll/> A dislocation line is rarely uniformly straight, often containing many curves and steps that can impede or facilitate dislocation movement by acting as pinpoints or nucleation points respectively. Because jogs are out of the glide plane, under shear they cannot move by glide (movement along the glide plane). They instead must rely on vacancy diffusion facilitated climb to move through the lattice.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.|last1=Cai|first2=W. D.|last2=Nix|title=Imperfections in crystalline solids|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016}}</ref>. Away from the melting point of a material, vacancy diffusion is a slow process, so jogs act as immobile barriers at room temperature for most metals.<ref name=\"courtney00\">{{cite book|first=T. H.|last=Courtney|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|location=Long Grove, IL|publisher=Waveland|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nJogs typically form when two non-parallel dislocations cross during slip. The presence of jogs in a material increases its [[yield strength]] by preventing easy glide of dislocations. A pair of immobile jogs in a dislocation will act as a [[Frank\u2013Read source]] under shear, increasing the overall dislocation density of a material.<ref name=\"courtney00\" /> When a material's yield strength is increased via dislocation density increase, particularly when done by mechanical work, it is called [[work hardening]]. At high temperatures, vacancy facilitated movement of jogs becomes a much faster process, diminishing their overall effectiveness in impeding dislocation movement.\n\n=== Kink ===\n[[Kink (dislocation)|Kinks]] are steps in a dislocation line parallel to glide planes. Unlike jogs, they facilitate glide by acting as a nucleation point for dislocation movement. The lateral spreading of a kink from the nucleation point allows for forward propagation of the dislocation while only moving a few atoms at a time, reducing the overall energy barrier to slip.\n\n== Example in two dimensions (2D) ==\n\n[[File:Dislokation Dissoziation.svg|thumb|Dissociation of a pair of dislocations due to shearing (red arrows) of an hexagonal crystal in 2D. A dislocation in 2D consists of a bound pair of five-folded (green) and seven-folded (orange) coordination number.]]\nIn two dimensions (2D) only the edge dislocations exist, which play a central role in melting of 2D crystals, but not the screw dislocation.\nThose dislocations are [[Topology|topological]] point defects which implies that they cannot be created isolated by an [[affine transformation]] without cutting the hexagonal crystal up to infinity (or at least up to its boarder). They can only be created in pairs with antiparallel [[Burgers_vector |Burgers vector]]. If a lot of dislocations are e.&nbsp;g. thermally excited, the discrete translational order of the crystal is destroyed. Simultaneously, the [[shear modulus]] and the [[Young's modulus]] disappear, which implies that the crystal is molten to a fluid phase. The orientational order is not yet destroyed (as indicated by lattice lines in one direction) and one finds - very similar to liquid crystals - a fluid phase with typically a six-folded director field. This so-called [[hexatic phase]] still has an orientational stiffness. The isotropic fluid phase appears, if the dislocations dissociate into isolated five-folded and seven-folded [[Disclination|disclinations]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Gasser | first=U. | last2=Eisenmann | first2=C. | last3=Maret | first3=G. | last4=Keim | first4=P. | title=Melting of crystals in two dimensions | journal=ChemPhysChem | volume=11 |issue=5 | date=2010 | doi=10.1002/cphc.200900755 | pmid=20099292 | pages=963\u2013970| url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-112435 }}</ref> This two step melting is described within the so-called Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young-theory ([[KTHNY theory]]), based on two transitions of [[Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless_transition|Kosterlitz-Thouless-type]].\n\n==Observation==\n=== Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ===\n[[Image:TEM micrograph dislocations precipitate stainless steel 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Transmission electron micrograph]] of dislocations]]\n[[Image:TEM micrograph dislocations precipitate stainless steel 2.jpg|right|thumb|Transmission electron micrograph of dislocations]]\n\n[[Transmission electron microscopy]] can be used to observe dislocations within the [[microstructure]] of the material.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=J.C.H.|authorlink1 = John C.

The [[electron]] beam undergoes [[diffraction]] by the regular crystal lattice planes into a diffraction pattern and contrast is generated in the image by this diffraction (as well as by thickness variations, varying strain, and other mechanisms). Dislocations have different local atomic structure and produce a strain field, and therefore will cause the electrons in the microscope to scatter in different ways. Note the characteristic 'wiggly' contrast of the dislocation lines as they pass through the thickness of the material in the figure (also note that dislocations cannot end in a crystal, and these dislocations are terminating at the surfaces since the image is a 2D projection).\n\nDislocations do not have random structures, the local atomic structure of a dislocation is determined by the Burgers vector. One very useful application of the TEM in dislocation imaging is the ability to experimentally determine the Burgers vector. Determination of the Burgers vector is achieved by what is known as <math>\\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{b}</math> (\"g dot b\") analysis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transmission electron microscopy : a textbook for materials science|first=David B. |last=Williams |first2=C.

The vector in the diffraction pattern from the transmitted spot to the diffracted spot is the <math>\\vec{g}</math> vector. The contrast of a dislocation is scaled by a factor of the dot product of this vector and the Burgers vector (<math>\\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{b}</math>). As a result, if the Burgers vector and <math>\\vec{g}</math> vector are perpendicular, there will be no signal from the dislocation and the dislocation will not appear at all in the image. Therefore, by examining different dark field images formed from spots with different g vectors, the Burgers vector can be determined.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[Image:Silicon_dislocation_orientation_111_mag_500x.png|right|thumb|Etch Pits formed on the ends of dislocations in silicon, orientation (111)]]\n\n[[Field ion microscopy]] and [[atom probe]] techniques offer methods of producing much higher magnifications (typically 3 million times and above) and permit the observation of dislocations at an atomic level. Where surface relief can be resolved to the level of an atomic step, screw dislocations appear as distinctive spiral features \u2013 thus revealing an important mechanism of crystal growth: where there is a surface step, atoms can more easily add to the crystal, and the surface step associated with a screw dislocation is never destroyed no matter how many atoms are added to it.\n\n==== Chemical etching ====\nWhen a dislocation line intersects the surface of a metallic material, the associated strain field locally increases the relative susceptibility of the material to acid [[industrial etching|etching]] and an [[etch pit density|etch pit]] of regular geometrical format results. In this way, dislocations in silicon, for example, can be observed ''indirectly'' using an interference microscope. Crystal orientation can be determined by the shape of the etch pits associated with the dislocations.\n\nIf the material is deformed and repeatedly re-etched, a series of etch pits can be produced which effectively trace the movement of the dislocation in question.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|dislocation}}\n{{Commons category|Dislocations in crystals}}\n* [http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/index.html Defects in Crystals/ Prof. Dr. Helmut F\u00f6ll website] Chapter 5 contains a wealth of information on dislocations;\n* [http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/dislocations/ DoITPoMS] Online tutorial on dislocations, including movies of dislocations in [[bubble raft]]s;\n* [https://www.enggstudy.com/2019/10/difference-between-edge-dislocation-and-screw-dislocation.html Difference between Edge dislocation and Screw dislocation] Difference between Edge dislocation and Screw dislocation in detail;\n* [http://www.iap.tuwien.ac.at/www/surface/STM_Gallery/ Scanning Tunneling Microscope \u2013 Gallery] Image gallery, including a dislocations page, seen at the atomic level of metal surfaces, by the surface physics group at the Faculty of Physics, Vienna University of Technology, Austria.\n* [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/volterra_-_equilibrium_of_multiply_connected_bodies.pdf Volterra, V., \"On the equilibrium of multiply-connected bodies,\" trans. by D.

''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]].

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species),<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref> and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=PowleslandA>{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate's cache if given the opportunity.<ref name=Powlesland/> Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males.<ref name=SteerBurns>{{cite journal|last1=Steer|first1=Jamie|last2=Burns|first2=KC|year=2008|title=Seasonal variation in male-female competition, cooperation and selfish hoarding in a monogamous songbird|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1175\u20131183|doi=10.1007/s00265-008-0546-z}}</ref> During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.<ref name=PowleslandA/>\n\nSouth Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age. They begin their breeding season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) and thus can make use of the winter's remaining food stores during this time.<ref name=Powlesland/> They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

The purpose of JSA is to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants. JSA is sponsored by the Junior State of America Foundation Inc. (JSAF, a [[501c]](3) non-profit corporation), which also operates the JSA Summer Schools. The Junior State of America is student-run, the largest such organization in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jsa.org/summer/why-jsa/experience/|title=Experience \u2013 JSA|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Reference is from organization's own site, and site also shows adult staff, so is it student-run?|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Overview ==\n\nStudents organize every aspect of the organization, from the local chapter level to the regional level.  The members elect local, regional, and state leaders to organize JSA conventions, conferences, and political awareness events.\n\nJSA is both a local and a national organization.  The JSA is organized by regions, somewhat congruous with the real geographic United States regions. At the high school chapter level, chapter presidents organize local activities and meetings. On the regional level, mayors and vice mayors organize regional one-day conferences.  On the state level, [[Governor (United States)|governors]] and [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governors]] organize overnight conventions and other activities.  On the national level, governors are in communication with each other planning convention themes and steering the direction of the organization.\n\n Simulations include, for example, [[Model United Nations]], [[Model Congress]] (with a [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]), crisis simulations, and other activities. JSA provides an opportunity to meet other students from outside their home communities who share similar interests; furthermore, debate conventions usually include various evening activities like dining downtown or [[impromptu debate]].\n\nIn addition to sponsoring the JSA, the JSF sponsors three- and four-week Summer School sessions for JSA members and other high school students.  These are held at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and week-long symposium on state and local politics are held in several states.<ref>Ward, William J., New Jersey Eminent Domain Law Blog, Aug. 15, 2007, \"Junior Statesmen hear eminent domain talk,\" http://www.njeminentdomain.com/state-of-new-jersey-junior-statesmen-hear-eminent-domain-talk.html</ref> (In years past, JSF has held Summer School sessions at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[University of California, Davis]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]). Sessions include college-level courses on political science, economics, history and public speaking. Students from all over the world, (most notably England, France, Turkey, Micronesia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hong Kong) attend Summer School.<ref>Author Unknown, Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, June 5, 1997, \"Six FSM High School Students Selected for 1997 DOI Junior Statesmen Summer School,\" http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr06059a.htm</ref> The revenue from these programs help fund the school-year JSA program. Additionally, JSA supports all cats. \n\n== History ==\nJSA was founded in 1934 by Professor E. A. Rogers at the Montezuma Mountain School in [[Los Gatos, California]], as an experiment in self-government.<ref>Author Unknown, Los Gatos Weekly Times, Aug. 16, 2000, \"Junior Statesmen alumni gather,\" http://www.svcn.com/archives/lgwt/08.16.00/jrstatesmen-0033.html</ref>  Students at the Montezuma Mountain School set up their own tree-branch government, complete with a student court, police force, executive officer, and legislative branch.  The students would draft, pass, and enforce their own rules.<ref>Author Unknown, \"Junior Statesmen,\" Time Magazine, Sept. 14, 1942, http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802465,00.html</ref>\n\nThe JSA has had liaisons with other similar organizations outside of the United States. For example, throughout the 1980s the Pacific-Northwest State developed close ties with the [[British Columbia Youth Parliament]] (BCYP).  \"Ambassadors\" were invited from the Pacific-Northwest State to attend the December BCYP legislative session in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], as well a number of BCYP sponsored events, including the \"[[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]] Conference\" held in 1985, a project to celebrate the [[United Nations]] [[International Youth Year|International Year of the Youth]], involving the BCYP, the [[TUXIS Parliament of Alberta]], and the JSA.  In turn, the BCYP would send delegates to attend Pacific-Northwest Spring and Fall State.  The Southern California state also added the American School in Honduras as a chapter in 2006 and the school's chapter attended the annual Congress convention.  There are two active chapters in [[St. Kitts]] and [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands|St. Thomas, USVI]]. [[Puerto Rico]] has traditionally one or two chapters.  All Caribbean chapters attend either the Northeast State or Mid-Atlantic State conventions.\n\nSince its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have participated in the JSA.\n\n=== Notable alumni ===\nNotable former members include [[Leon Panetta]] (Former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States Congressman]], and Member of the [[California State Senate]]), [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]] (Press Secretary under President [[Bill Clinton]]), [[Edwin Meese]] (Attorney General under President [[Ronald Reagan]]), [[Jennifer Palmieri]] ([[White House Communications Director|White House Communication Director]] under President [[Barack Obama]]) businessman and inventor [[Charles R.

Both consist of debates, thought talks, and special activities, including political fairs and a casual dance. Fall State is one night, students typically arrive at the hotel on a Saturday and return home the following day.  Spring State, by comparison, usually takes place over three days, students arriving at the hotel on a Friday and returning on Sunday.  At this longer spring convention JSA members in attendance elect regional leaders for the upcoming year.  Both Fall and Spring State conventions are highlighted by prestigious keynote speakers, with past speakers including [[Pat Robertson]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Colin Powell]], [[Jahana Hayes]], [[Tom Malinowski]], [[Fareed Zakaria]] and [[Joe Trippi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jsa.org/school-year/conventions/convention-activities/|title=Convention Activities \u2013 JSA|website=www.jsa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Winter Congress convention ===\nWinter Congress is structured similar to the [[United States Congress]]: students are divided into Senate and House of Representative committees. Student delegates pass bills in committees and then in floor sessions of the Senate and House. If a bill passes both houses, it becomes JSA law.\n\n=== Regional conferences ===\nThere are also smaller, regional conferences and chapter-conferences (\"chapter-cons\") which occur on a local level.  Regionals are run by the Mayors and Vice-Mayors of Regions along with the Regional Cabinet members that they appoint.  Chapter-cons are usually hosted by chapters at individual schools and are not officially JSA-sponsored events.\n\n== Elected positions and cabinet ==\nAs a student-run organization, each JSA state holds elections yearly at the Spring State conventions to elect student elected officials who serve one-year terms. Each state elects a Governor and Lieutenant Governor, as well as various other offices that differ from state to state. These officials each appoint a small cabinet that helps them run the organization by completing tasks such as organizing convention logistics, writing debates, producing publicity materials, founding new chapters, and running websites. There is also a National Cabinet appointed by the Council of Governors. JSA officials and cabinet members are typically extremely dedicated to JSA, and often spend many hours per week doing their jobs.\n\n== Summer programs ==\nAfter the school year is over, JSA and JSF offer numerous summer programs. The biggest programs, which are held at major universities, are Summer Schools, which are conducted by the Junior Statesmen Foundation and offer students an opportunity to study local, state, or national government at an advanced level. These programs are meant to prepare young leaders for active participation in public affairs. \n\nThese programs, at which students take a full semester of two courses over three or four weeks, for which they can receive high school credit, take place at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Peking University|Beijing]]. Along with debate and regular classes (including Advanced Placement and Law Classes), students participate in a vigorous Speaker's Program in which notable speakers talk about current issues to the students. Past speakers have included [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]], [[Andy Card]], [[Ben Bernanke]], [[Lee H. Hamilton]], [[Norman Mineta]], [[Joe Trippi]], [[Dennis Kucinich]], [[Chuck Hagel]], [[Katie Couric]], [[Brian Williams]], [[Geraldine Ferraro]], [[John Kerry]], [[Harry Reid]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Ted Rall]], [[George H.W. Bush]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[Ed Meese]], [[William Perry]], [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Brian Williams]], [[Karl Rove]], [[Sebastian Gorka]], and [[Sarah Huckabee Sanders]].\n\nSummer institutes are also held in different regions, such as the summer symposium of [[Arizona State]], [[Stanford]], [[UCLA]], [[Princeton University]]  and [[University of Texas]].  These events are four- to five-days long and venture into politics, world studies, history, national security and discussions of current events. Princeton's event is nicknamed \"Princetitute.\" These events used to be known as [[symposium|symposia]].\n\nEvery summer, the newly elected governors each choose a select few from their states or territories to attend the Montezuma National Leadership Summit (affectionately known as \"Zuma\").  The summit is held in early-to-mid August at Presentation Center in [[Los Gatos, California]], the former site of the Montezuma Mountain School where JSA was founded in 1934.  Students who are selected to attend this summit learn more about the history and national dynamics of JSA. Being selected for attendance is considered one of the ultimate JSA honors, and many of the students that attend lead future years of the Junior State.  Subsequently, two or three students are selected out of class to become a National Montezuma Foundation Student Advisor, working with the Junior State Foundation to preside over budget and funding allocations for the National Montezuma Summit.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.jsa.org/ Official website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Junior State Of America}}\n[[Category:Youth organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Political organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Youth model government]]\n[[Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations]]\n[[Category:Burlingame, California]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:1934 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1934]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|American youth civics organization}}\n{{primary sources|date=December 2018}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| name = Junior State of America\n| image = Junior State of America (emblem).jpg\n| image_border = \n| size = 200px\n| alt = \n| caption = \n| map = \n| msize = \n| malt = \n| mcaption = \n| abbreviation = JSA\n| motto = Be the People\n| formation = 1934\n| extinction = \n| type = High school club\n| status = Non-profit\n| purpose = Non-partisan civics education program\n| headquarters = [[Oakland]], [[California]]\n| location = 70 Washington St., Suite 320, Oakland, CA 94607\n| region_served = United States\n| membership = \n| language = \n| leader_title = \n| leader_name = \n| main_organ = \n| parent_organization = The Junior State of America Foundation\n| affiliations = \n| num_staff = 15\n| num_volunteers = \n| budget = \n| website = http://www.jsa.org\n| remarks = \n}}\n\nThe '''Junior State of America''' (formerly the '''Junior Statesmen of America'''), abbreviated '''JSA''', is an [[United States|American]] [[non-partisan]] [[youth organization]]. The purpose of JSA is to help high school students acquire leadership skills and the knowledge necessary to be effective debaters and civic participants. JSA is sponsored by the Junior State of America Foundation Inc. (JSAF, a [[501c]](3) non-profit corporation), which also operates the JSA Summer Schools. The Junior State of America is student-run, the largest such organization in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jsa.org/summer/why-jsa/experience/|title=Experience \u2013 JSA|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Reference is from organization's own site, and site also shows adult staff, so is it student-run?|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Overview ==\n\nStudents organize every aspect of the organization, from the local chapter level to the regional level.  The members elect local, regional, and state leaders to organize JSA conventions, conferences, and political awareness events.\n\nJSA is both a local and a national organization.  The JSA is organized by regions, somewhat congruous with the real geographic United States regions. At the high school chapter level, chapter presidents organize local activities and meetings. On the regional level, mayors and vice mayors organize regional one-day conferences.  On the state level, [[Governor (United States)|governors]] and [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governors]] organize overnight conventions and other activities.  On the national level, governors are in communication with each other planning convention themes and steering the direction of the organization.\n\nThe JSA program includes debates, \"thought talks\", problem solving, and a variety of simulations designed to provide members with an informed viewpoint and the ability to analyse important issues.  Simulations include, for example, [[Model United Nations]], [[Model Congress]] (with a [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]), crisis simulations, and other activities. JSA provides an opportunity to meet other students from outside their home communities who share similar interests; furthermore, debate conventions usually include various evening activities like dining downtown or [[impromptu debate]].\n\nIn addition to sponsoring the JSA, the JSF sponsors three- and four-week Summer School sessions for JSA members and other high school students.  These are held at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and week-long symposium on state and local politics are held in several states.<ref>Ward, William J., New Jersey Eminent Domain Law Blog, Aug. 15, 2007, \"Junior Statesmen hear eminent domain talk,\" http://www.njeminentdomain.com/state-of-new-jersey-junior-statesmen-hear-eminent-domain-talk.html</ref> (In years past, JSF has held Summer School sessions at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Northwestern University]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[University of California, Davis]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]). Sessions include college-level courses on political science, economics, history and public speaking. Students from all over the world, (most notably England, France, Turkey, Micronesia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hong Kong) attend Summer School.<ref>Author Unknown, Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, June 5, 1997, \"Six FSM High School Students Selected for 1997 DOI Junior Statesmen Summer School,\" http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr06059a.htm</ref> The revenue from these programs help fund the school-year JSA program.\n\n== History ==\nJSA was founded in 1934 by Professor E. A. Rogers at the Montezuma Mountain School in [[Los Gatos, California]], as an experiment in self-government.<ref>Author Unknown, Los Gatos Weekly Times, Aug. 16, 2000, \"Junior Statesmen alumni gather,\" http://www.svcn.com/archives/lgwt/08.16.00/jrstatesmen-0033.html</ref>  Students at the Montezuma Mountain School set up their own tree-branch government, complete with a student court, police force, executive officer, and legislative branch.  The students would draft, pass, and enforce their own rules.<ref>Author Unknown, \"Junior Statesmen,\" Time Magazine, Sept. 14, 1942, http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802465,00.html</ref>\n\nThe JSA has had liaisons with other similar organizations outside of the United States. For example, throughout the 1980s the Pacific-Northwest State developed close ties with the [[British Columbia Youth Parliament]] (BCYP).  \"Ambassadors\" were invited from the Pacific-Northwest State to attend the December BCYP legislative session in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], as well a number of BCYP sponsored events, including the \"[[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]] Conference\" held in 1985, a project to celebrate the [[United Nations]] [[International Youth Year|International Year of the Youth]], involving the BCYP, the [[TUXIS Parliament of Alberta]], and the JSA.  In turn, the BCYP would send delegates to attend Pacific-Northwest Spring and Fall State.  The Southern California state also added the American School in Honduras as a chapter in 2006 and the school's chapter attended the annual Congress convention.  There are two active chapters in [[St. Kitts]] and [[St. Thomas, Virgin Islands|St. Thomas, USVI]]. [[Puerto Rico]] has traditionally one or two chapters.  All Caribbean chapters attend either the Northeast State or Mid-Atlantic State conventions.\n\nSince its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have participated in the JSA.\n\n=== Notable alumni ===\nNotable former members include [[Leon Panetta]] (Former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States Congressman]], and Member of the [[California State Senate]]), [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]] (Press Secretary under President [[Bill Clinton]]), [[Edwin Meese]] (Attorney General under President [[Ronald Reagan]]), [[Jennifer Palmieri]] ([[White House Communications Director|White House Communication Director]] under President [[Barack Obama]]) businessman and inventor [[Charles R.

Students who are selected to attend this summit learn more about the history and national dynamics of JSA. Being selected for attendance is considered one of the ultimate JSA honors, and many of the students that attend lead future years of the Junior State.  Subsequently, two or three students are selected out of class to become a National Montezuma Foundation Student Advisor, working with the Junior State Foundation to preside over budget and funding allocations for the National Montezuma Summit.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.jsa.org/ Official website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Junior State Of America}}\n[[Category:Youth organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Political organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Youth model government]]\n[[Category:501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations]]\n[[Category:Burlingame, California]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:1934 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1934]]\n", "name_user": "97.113.58.161", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_State_of_America"}

The story itself was set in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], at that time the most important political and cultural center of [[Southern Italy]] and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the [[Neapolitan Language|Neapolitan dialect]]. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]'' (1697),<ref name=\"Bottigheimer, Ruth 2008 pp. 175\"/> and by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their folk tale collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' (1812).\n\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace.\n\n===''Cenerentola'', by Basile===\n[[Giambattista Basile]], an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled ''Lo cunto de li cunti'' (The Story of Stories), or ''[[Pentamerone]]''. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her slippers. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.<ref>Basile, Giambattista (1911).

The gentleman marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two [[false hero|daughters]], who are equally vain and selfish. The girl is forced into servitude by her stepmother, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cinderella\" by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\n:One day, the Prince invites all the young ladies in the land to a [[ball (dance)|royal ball]], planning to choose a wife. The two [[Ugly sisters|stepsisters]] gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.\n:As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]] magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a [[pumpkin]] into a golden carriage, [[Mouse|mice]] into [[horse]]s, a [[rat]] into a [[coachman]], and [[lizard]]s into [[footman|footmen]]. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before [[midnight]], when the [[magic (paranormal)|spells]] will be broken.\n:At the ball, the entire [[noble court|court]] is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then innocently greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\n:Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The Prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The Prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\n:The Prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the Prince arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated classic fairy tales|date=2002|publisher=Norton|others=Tatar, Maria, 1945-|isbn=0393051633|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=49894271}}</ref> \n:Cinderella married the Prince as her stepsisters are married to two handsome gentlemen of the royal court.\n\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.

These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\"<ref name=\"pitt.edu\"/>\n\n===''Aschenputtel'', by the Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Aschenputtel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alexander Zick]] illustrated ''Cinderella with the doves'', inspired by the Grimms' version.]]\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century. The tale is called ''\"Aschenputtel\"'' (''\"Cinderella\"'' in English translations). This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that the heroine planted on her mother's grave.  In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Grimms supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and will always go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\n\n:One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.\n\n:The king decides to ordain a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\n\n:The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside a pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince falls in love with her and dances with her for the whole day, and when sunset comes, the prince tries to accompany her home again. However, she climbs a pear tree to escape him. The Prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel has disappeared. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel loses track of time, and when she runs away one of her golden slippers sticks on that pitch. The prince proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\n\n:The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. The sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two doves from Heaven tell the Prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that they keep a kitchen-maid in the house&nbsp;\u2013 omitting to mention that she is his own daughter&nbsp;\u2013 and the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing herself, and when she puts on the slipper, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the ball.\n\n:In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's wedding, as she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, (they had hoped to worm their way into her favour), the doves fly down and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. When the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church, the doves fly again, striking the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind, a punishment they had to endure for the rest of their lives.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19068/19068-h/19068-h.htm#illus-135 Aschenputtel], included in ''Household Stories'' by the Brothers Grimm, translated by Lucy Crane, at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nAschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter. However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child. He also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife's child\" and not his own.\n\n==Plot variations and alternative tellings==\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Cinderella.jpg|thumb|''Cinderella'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1863, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\n[[File:CinderAdelphi.jpg|thumb|right|Pantomime at the Adelphi]]\n[[File:Cinderella (1911).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''Cinderella'' (1911)]]\n\n===Villains===\nIn some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney film]], Cinderella's father has died and so has Cinderella's mother.\n\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type [[Antti Aarne|510A]] is a female persecutor: in ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Finette Cendron]]'', the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]'', ''[[Catskin]]'', All-Kinds-of-Fur, and ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/other.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]\"</ref> In ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\n\nIn ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', [[Gioachino Rossini]] inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her [[Stepfamily#stepfathers|stepfather]]. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' [[dowry|dowries]] larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.<ref>[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p 213-4 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}</ref>\n\n===Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew===\nThe number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The [[fairy godmother]] is Perrault's own addition to the tale.<ref>Jane Yolen, p 23, ''Touch Magic'' {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]]'s version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as ''The Cinder Maid'', collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]], and the Finnish ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''. Playwright [[James Lapine]] incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''. [[Giambattista Basile]]'s ''[[Cenerentola]]'' combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', ''[[Rushen Coatie]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'', ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]'', or ''[[The Sharp Grey Sheep]]''\u2014these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in ''[[The Golden Slipper]]'', a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. [[Gioachino Rossini]], having agreed to do an opera based on ''Cinderella'' if he could omit all magical elements, wrote ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\n\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 116 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as ''Katie Woodencloak'' and ''The Golden Slipper'' have her attend church.\n\nIn the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty. However, on the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes. In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds\u2014or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.\n\n===The identifying item===\nThe glass slipper is unique to [[Charles Perrault]]'s version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[German language|German]]: ''Aschenbroedel'' and ''Aschenputtel'', for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"''[[La Cenerentola]]''\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'' the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (''pantoufle de verre'') had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (''pantoufle de [[vair]]'') in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 28, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>  The [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney adaptation]] takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\n\nAnother interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element\u2014the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a '[[Droit du seigneur]]' right of sexual possession of his subjects. The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).\n\nThe translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason. Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone. In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Witches Abroad]]'', the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her. In \"When the Clock Strikes\" (from ''[[Red As Blood]]''), [[Tanith Lee]] had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.\n\n[[Image:Gustave dore cendrillon4.JPG|thumb|Cinderella tries on the slipper]]\n\n===The Revelation===\nCinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.  In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother. The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.\n\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 126-8 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref> The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\n\n===The Conclusion===\nIn the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds. In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.\n\nIn [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Thousand Nights and A Night]], in a tale called \"The Anklet\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Mardrus | first = Joseph-Charles | authorlink = Joseph-Charles Mardrus |author2=Powys Mathers  | title = The book of the Thousand Nights and One Night | volume = 4 | publisher = [[Routledge]] |date= June 1987 | location = London and New York | pages = 191\u2013194 | isbn = 0-415-04543-6 }}</ref> the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'', the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\n\nIn an episode of [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'', writer [[Anthony Minghella]] merged the old folk tale ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' (also written by Perrault) with ''Cinderella'' to tell the tale of ''Sapsorrow'', a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\n\nMany popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other. Examples are the film ''[[Ever After]]'', ''Cinderella 3'' and the Broadway revival.\n\n==Folkloristics==\n\n*\n\n[[File:Cendrillon2 crop.jpg|thumb|Cinderella or Cendrillon in French.

The story itself was set in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], at that time the most important political and cultural center of [[Southern Italy]] and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the [[Neapolitan Language|Neapolitan dialect]]. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]'' (1697),<ref name=\"Bottigheimer, Ruth 2008 pp. 175\"/> and by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their folk tale collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' (1812).\n\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace.\n\n===''Cenerentola'', by Basile===\n[[Giambattista Basile]], an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled ''Lo cunto de li cunti'' (The Story of Stories), or ''[[Pentamerone]]''. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her slippers. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.<ref>Basile, Giambattista (1911).

Marc Soriano (Paris: Flammarion, 1989), pp. 274\u201379.</ref>\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A wealthy widower has a beautiful young daughter; a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The gentleman marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two [[false hero|daughters]], who are equally vain and selfish. The girl is forced into servitude by her stepmother, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cinderella\" by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\n:One day, the Prince invites all the young ladies in the land to a [[ball (dance)|royal ball]], planning to choose a wife. The two [[Ugly sisters|stepsisters]] gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.\n:As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]] magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a [[pumpkin]] into a golden carriage, [[Mouse|mice]] into [[horse]]s, a [[rat]] into a [[coachman]], and [[lizard]]s into [[footman|footmen]]. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before [[midnight]], when the [[magic (paranormal)|spells]] will be broken.\n:At the ball, the entire [[noble court|court]] is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then innocently greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\n:Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The Prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The Prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\n:The Prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the Prince arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated classic fairy tales|date=2002|publisher=Norton|others=Tatar, Maria, 1945-|isbn=0393051633|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=49894271}}</ref> \n:Cinderella married the Prince as her stepsisters are married to two handsome gentlemen of the royal court.\n\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.

These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\"<ref name=\"pitt.edu\"/>\n\n===''Aschenputtel'', by the Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Aschenputtel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alexander Zick]] illustrated ''Cinderella with the doves'', inspired by the Grimms' version.]]\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century. The tale is called ''\"Aschenputtel\"'' (''\"Cinderella\"'' in English translations). This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that the heroine planted on her mother's grave.  In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Grimms supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and will always go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\n\n:One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.\n\n:The king decides to ordain a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\n\n:The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside a pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince falls in love with her and dances with her for the whole day, and when sunset comes, the prince tries to accompany her home again. However, she climbs a pear tree to escape him. The Prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel has disappeared. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel loses track of time, and when she runs away one of her golden slippers sticks on that pitch. The prince proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\n\n:The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. The sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two doves from Heaven tell the Prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that they keep a kitchen-maid in the house&nbsp;\u2013 omitting to mention that she is his own daughter&nbsp;\u2013 and the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing herself, and when she puts on the slipper, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the ball.\n\n:In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's wedding, as she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, (they had hoped to worm their way into her favour), the doves fly down and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. When the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church, the doves fly again, striking the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind, a punishment they had to endure for the rest of their lives.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19068/19068-h/19068-h.htm#illus-135 Aschenputtel], included in ''Household Stories'' by the Brothers Grimm, translated by Lucy Crane, at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nAschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter. However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child. He also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife's child\" and not his own.\n\n==Plot variations and alternative tellings==\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Cinderella.jpg|thumb|''Cinderella'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1863, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\n[[File:CinderAdelphi.jpg|thumb|right|Pantomime at the Adelphi]]\n[[File:Cinderella (1911).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''Cinderella'' (1911)]]\n\n===Villains===\nIn some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney film]], Cinderella's father has died and so has Cinderella's mother.\n\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type [[Antti Aarne|510A]] is a female persecutor: in ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Finette Cendron]]'', the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]'', ''[[Catskin]]'', All-Kinds-of-Fur, and ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/other.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]\"</ref> In ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\n\nIn ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', [[Gioachino Rossini]] inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her [[Stepfamily#stepfathers|stepfather]]. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' [[dowry|dowries]] larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.<ref>[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p 213-4 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}</ref>\n\n===Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew===\nThe number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The [[fairy godmother]] is Perrault's own addition to the tale.<ref>Jane Yolen, p 23, ''Touch Magic'' {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]]'s version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as ''The Cinder Maid'', collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]], and the Finnish ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''. Playwright [[James Lapine]] incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''. [[Giambattista Basile]]'s ''[[Cenerentola]]'' combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', ''[[Rushen Coatie]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'', ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]'', or ''[[The Sharp Grey Sheep]]''\u2014these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in ''[[The Golden Slipper]]'', a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. [[Gioachino Rossini]], having agreed to do an opera based on ''Cinderella'' if he could omit all magical elements, wrote ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\n\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 116 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as ''Katie Woodencloak'' and ''The Golden Slipper'' have her attend church.\n\nIn the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty. However, on the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes. In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds\u2014or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.\n\n===The identifying item===\nThe glass slipper is unique to [[Charles Perrault]]'s version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[German language|German]]: ''Aschenbroedel'' and ''Aschenputtel'', for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"''[[La Cenerentola]]''\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'' the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (''pantoufle de verre'') had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (''pantoufle de [[vair]]'') in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 28, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>  The [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney adaptation]] takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\n\nAnother interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element\u2014the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a '[[Droit du seigneur]]' right of sexual possession of his subjects. The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).\n\nThe translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason. Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone. In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Witches Abroad]]'', the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her. In \"When the Clock Strikes\" (from ''[[Red As Blood]]''), [[Tanith Lee]] had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.\n\n[[Image:Gustave dore cendrillon4.JPG|thumb|Cinderella tries on the slipper]]\n\n===The Revelation===\nCinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.  In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother. The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.\n\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 126-8 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref> The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\n\n===The Conclusion===\nIn the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds. In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.\n\nIn [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Thousand Nights and A Night]], in a tale called \"The Anklet\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Mardrus | first = Joseph-Charles | authorlink = Joseph-Charles Mardrus |author2=Powys Mathers  | title = The book of the Thousand Nights and One Night | volume = 4 | publisher = [[Routledge]] |date= June 1987 | location = London and New York | pages = 191\u2013194 | isbn = 0-415-04543-6 }}</ref> the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'', the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\n\nIn an episode of [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'', writer [[Anthony Minghella]] merged the old folk tale ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' (also written by Perrault) with ''Cinderella'' to tell the tale of ''Sapsorrow'', a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\n\nMany popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other. Examples are the film ''[[Ever After]]'', ''Cinderella 3'' and the Broadway revival.\n\n==Folkloristics==\n\n*\n\n[[File:Cendrillon2 crop.jpg|thumb|Cinderella or Cendrillon in French.

He opposed [[laissez-faire]] in industry, supported productivity agreements to replace wage-bargaining, and sought an economy devoted to building national resources rather than satisfying consumer demand.<ref name=\"chanock\" />\n\nThe ERDC's approach was criticised by [[John X. Merriman]], the last Prime Minister of the [[Cape Colony]]. Merriman derided Wilson-Fox's proposals as \"ridiculous\", and claimed that they amounted to \"The British Empire being managed ... I suppose like the Chartered Company\".<ref name=\"chanock\" />\nIn England, the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and the [[Aborigines Protection Society]]' attacked the proposed creation of state monopolies, and the usurpation of the land rights of Africans who would become labourers rather than farmers.<ref name=\"chanock\" />\n\n=== Parliament ===\nIn February 1917, [[Francis Newdegate]] MP was appointed as [[Governor of Tasmania]]. This created a vacancy for Newdegate's parliamentary seat of [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] in [[Staffordshire]], and on 13 February Wilson-Fox was adopted as the Unionist (Conservative) candidate for the [[1917 Tamworth by-election|resulting by-election]].<ref name=\"times-1917-02-14\" />\n\nThe [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] did not nominate a candidate,<ref name=\"times-1917-02-17\" />\nkeeping the war-time electoral truce.

The EDRC's work led to the formation of an Empire Development Parliamentary Committee, of which Fox-Wilson became the vice-chair. By 1921, it had over 200 members.<ref name=\"times-1921-11-25-tribute-from-bigland\" />\n\nIn July 1917, he moved an amendment to the [[Finance Bill]] which would have given a reduction in the [[income tax]] paid on the returns from investments made within the Empire.<ref name=\"times-1917-07-19-income-tax\" />\nLater that month he was appointed to the Commons [[select committee]] on finance.<ref name=\"times-1917-07-26-select-ctte\" />\n\nIn February 1921, he came fourth in the annual ballot for [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Members' Bills]].

Wilson-Fox''' <small>[[Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society|FRGS]]</small>  (18 August 1863 \u2013 22 November 1921) was an English lawyer, journalist, tennis player, and businessman. He built his career in [[Rhodesia]], where he became an associate of [[Cecil Rhodes]], manager of the [[British South Africa Company]], and an advocate of Rhodes's [[imperialist]] ideals.<ref name=\"anglo-african\" /><ref name=\"times-1917-02-14\" />\n\nIn 1916 Wilson-Fox was a founder of the Empire Resources Development Committee, which promoted the idea of state-managed commercial development of the [[British Empire]]. He was elected in 1917 as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]]. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], he focused on finance and imperial development until his death in 1921.\n\n== Early life and family ==\nThe son of [[Wilson Fox]], physician to [[Queen Victoria]], he was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], [[Marlborough College]], [[University College London]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"debrett-1918\" />\nWilson-Fox was an exhibitioner and scholar at Trinity,<ref name=\"anglo-african\" />\nwhere he graduated with a BA in [[natural sciences]].<ref name=\"debrett-1918\" />\nHe represented [[Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club|Cambridge University]] at [[lawn tennis]] in 1885\u201386, and thereafter made tennis and golf his main recreations.<ref name=\"anglo-african\" />\n\nWilson-Fox was [[called to the bar]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1888,<ref name=\"debrett-1918\" />\nhaving been an equity scholar.<ref name=\"anglo-african\" />\n\nIn 1898 he married the Hon.

He was [[mentioned in despatches]] and received a medal with clasp.<ref name=\"debrett-1918\" />\n\nWilson-Fox returned to England for a holiday in May 1897, when he was offered the role of manager of the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC).<ref name=\"anglo-african\" />\nThe BSAC was a [[chartered company]] which administered [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]]. Southern Rhodesia is now [[Zimbabwe]], and the two northern zones were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]], which achieved independence in 1964 as [[Zambia]]. BSAC's role in the [[Jameson Raid]] and the Matabele Wars, along with its manipulation of share prices, made it the best-known charter company.<ref name=\"cavanagh\">{{Cite book\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5zTkGKy4wEC&pg=PA342\n | title = Encyclopedia of the Age of Imperialism, 1800\u20131914\n | page = 342\n | editor-first = Carl Cavanagh\n | editor-last = Hodge\n | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 978-0313334047\n | accessdate = 27 June 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nHe took up the post the following year,<ref name=\"debrett-1918\" />\naged 35.

The first article was \"The need for new methods\", in which he warned against attempts to pay off the war debt too quickly.<ref name=\"times-finance-after-the-war-part1\" />\nHe proposed that the state should instead cut taxation, and increase borrowing to invest in economic growth.<ref name=\"times-finance-after-the-war-part1\" />\nIn the second article \"A board of development\", he proposed the creation of a Board of Imperial Development which would invest in schemes anywhere in the [[British Empire]] which did not compete with existing commercial ventures and promised a [[return on investment]] of at least 10% per annum.<ref name=\"times-finance-after-the-war-part2\" />\nThe first of the two articles was accompanied by an [[editorial]] in which ''The Times'' supported the broad outline of his proposals.<ref name=\"times-constructive-finance\" />\n\nThe articles were reprinted and widely circulated, leading to an inaugural meeting on 31 October 1916 of a body which became the Empire Resources Development Committee (ERDC). The principal founders were Wilson-Fox, the Conservative MP [[Alfred Bigland]] (an early supporter of the [[Tariff Reform League]]), and [[Moreton Frewen]]. Frewen was a former cattle-rancher in Wyoming and a vice-president of the [[Imperial Federation League]].<ref name=\"constantine\" />\n\nThe Committee was publicly launched after a meeting in early 1917 at the London offices of the [[Rhodes Trust]] under the chairmanship of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]].<ref name=\"times-1917-01-29\" />\nDedicated to pursuing the aims set out by Wilson-Fox, the ERC was chaired by [[Sir Starr Jameson]], with Wilson-Fox as honorary secretary and [[Almeric Paget]] as honorary treasurer.<ref name=\"times-1917-01-30\" />\n\nThe committee's manifesto was published on 29 January 1917,<ref name=\"constantine\" /> \nclaiming to represent \"every party in the state\".<ref name=\"times-1917-01-29\" />\nThe ERDC claimed that if their plans were adopted, the national debt would not be a problem after the war.<ref name=\"times-1917-01-29\" />\n\nThe 33 signatories to the manifesto included MPs and former MPs, government ministers, writers, journalists, and businessmen (4 of whom were involved with the BSAC).<ref name=\"constantine\" /> The full list was:\n[[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor|Waldorf Astor]],\n[[Alfred Bigland]],\n[[Henry Birchenough]],\n[[Harry Brittain]],\n[[Sir William Bull, 1st Baronet|Wiliam Bull]], \n[[Henry Page Croft, 1st Baron Croft|Henry Page Croft]],\n[[Henry Cust]],\n[[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough|Lord Desborough]],\nthe [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|Earl of Dunraven]],\n[[Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, 1st Baronet|Sir Laming Worthington-Evans]],\n[[Algernon Firth]],\n[[Victor Fisher]],\n[[Moreton Frewen]], \nthe [[Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey|Earl Grey]],\n[[Rupert Gwynne]],\n[[John Hodge (politician)|John Hodge]],\n[[John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington|Lord Islington]],\n[[Sir Starr Jameson]],\n[[Rudyard Kipling]],\n[[Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock|Arthur Lawley]]\nW.

He opposed [[laissez-faire]] in industry, supported productivity agreements to replace wage-bargaining, and sought an economy devoted to building national resources rather than satisfying consumer demand.<ref name=\"chanock\" />\n\nThe ERDC's approach was criticised by [[John X. Merriman]], the last Prime Minister of the [[Cape Colony]]. Merriman derided Wilson-Fox's proposals as \"ridiculous\", and claimed that they amounted to \"The British Empire being managed ... I suppose like the Chartered Company\".<ref name=\"chanock\" />\nIn England, the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' and the [[Aborigines Protection Society]]' attacked the proposed creation of state monopolies, and the usurpation of the land rights of Africans who would become labourers rather than farmers.<ref name=\"chanock\" />\n\n=== Parliament ===\nIn February 1917, [[Francis Newdegate]] MP was appointed as [[Governor of Tasmania]]. This created a vacancy for Newdegate's parliamentary seat of [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] in [[Staffordshire]], and on 13 February Wilson-Fox was adopted as the Unionist (Conservative) candidate for the [[1917 Tamworth by-election|resulting by-election]].<ref name=\"times-1917-02-14\" />\n\nThe [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] did not nominate a candidate,<ref name=\"times-1917-02-17\" />\nkeeping the war-time electoral truce. (The Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties had agreed not to contest any vacancies which arose in seats held by their opponents.<ref>British parliamentary election results 1885\u20131918, page xiii</ref>)\nWhen nominations closed on 23 February, Wilson-Fox was the only candidate nominated, and so was declared elected without a vote.<ref name=\"times-1917-02-24\" /><ref name=\"craig1885-1918\" />\nHe was returned unopposed at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|general election in December 1918]].<ref name=\"craig1918-1949\" />\n\nIn Parliament he continue to promote the cause of trade and investment within the [[British Empire]]. The EDRC's work led to the formation of an Empire Development Parliamentary Committee, of which Fox-Wilson became the vice-chair. By 1921, it had over 200 members.<ref name=\"times-1921-11-25-tribute-from-bigland\" />\n\nIn July 1917, he moved an amendment to the [[Finance Bill]] which would have given a reduction in the [[income tax]] paid on the returns from investments made within the Empire.<ref name=\"times-1917-07-19-income-tax\" />\nLater that month he was appointed to the Commons [[select committee]] on finance.<ref name=\"times-1917-07-26-select-ctte\" />\n\nIn February 1921, he came fourth in the annual ballot for [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Members' Bills]]. He announced that he intended to present a bill to amend the provisions of the [[Trade Union Act 1913]] in respect of political levies.<ref name=\"times-1921-02-18\" />\n\nIn October 1921, Wilson-Fox was part of a delegation of MPs from the Empire Development Parliamentary Committee, who met with [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].  Led by Alfred Bigland, they pressed the case for more rapid development of the Empire \"to find openings for our millions of surplus population\". The MPs sought a \"gradual transfer to the overseas dominions\" of these surplus people, and Churchill expressed support for their ideas.<ref name=\"times-1921-11-10-churchill-support\" />\n\n== Death ==\nOn 19 November 1921, ''The Times'' reported that Wilson was \"seriously ill, and his condition gives cause for anxiety\".<ref name=\"times-1921-11-19-ill\" />\nDaily bulletins followed.\nOn Monday 21 November, it reported that \"his condition yesterday showed improvement\";<ref name=\"times-1921-11-21-ill\" />\nbut Tuesday's report was \"no improvement\".<ref name=\"times-1921-11-22-ill\" />\n\nThe following day, ''The Times'' announced his death in London, aged 58.<ref name=\"times-obit\" />\nWilson-Fox was buried on 25 November at [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in Surrey,<ref name=\"times-funeral\" />\nafter a funeral conducted by his brothers-in-law Canon Merewether and Canon Baggallay.<ref name=\"times-funeral2\" />\nA memorial service was held on 28 November at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]],<ref name=\"times-memorial-service\" />\nthe parish church of the House of Commons.\nThe [[1922 Tamworth by-election|by-election for his seat in the Commons]] was held on 17 January 1922, and won by the Conservative candidate [[Percy Newson|Sir Percy Newson, Bt]].<ref name=\"craig1918-1949\" />\n\nHis estate was valued at \u00a363,020<ref name=\"times-will\" />\n(equivalent to \u00a3{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|63,020|1922}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}),\nwith net [[personalty]] of \u00a341,678<ref name=\"times-will\" />\n(equivalent to \u00a3{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|41,678|1922}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).\n\nHis wife Eleanor survived him by more than 40 years, dying aged 92 in October 1963.<ref name=\"times-1963-eleanor-death\" />\nShe had been made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1918 for her work as Chairman of the South African Comforts Committee in London.<ref name=\"times-1918-03-15-eleanor-cbe\" />\n\nHenry and Eleanor Wilson-Fox had two children.
