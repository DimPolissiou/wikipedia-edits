The game features some [[Universal Monsters]] including The [[Gill-man|Creature from the Black Lagoon]], [[Larry Talbot|The Wolf Man]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Bride of Frankenstein]], [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and [[Imhotep (character)|The Mummy]].\n\n==Description==\nThe main goal of the game is to collect the instruments of the iconic horror characters and form the ''Monsters of Rock'' band.<ref>http://www.pinballrebel.com/game/pins/mb/monster_bash_pinball.html</ref> The table includes a ''Phantom Flip''; when this feature is enabled, the player can let go of the flipper buttons and allow the game to attempt a shot.<ref>http://www.thepaisleys.com/PaisleyPinball/Fixes/phantom_flip.htm</ref><ref>http://www.planetarypinball.com/mm5/Williams/games/bash/features.htm</ref>\n\nThe machine has an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] mode called \u201c''Lyman\u2019s Lament''\u201d.

Each additional shot collects the points and resets the countdown to a higher value. Four hurry-up shots are needed to collect the Wolf Man's drum kit.\n* '''Creature Feature:''' Shoot the Creature's lagoon four times to start a hurry-up, then hit any lit shot (left/right ramps, left/right orbits, center lane) to collect it and start a 20-second timer. The remaining four shots each award increasing multiples of the hurry-up score and reset the timer, and all of them must be made to earn the Creature's saxophone. Shooting the lagoon credits the player with one shot, awards the relevant points, and resets the timer.\n* '''Ball and Chain:''' Shoot the left and right ramps three times each, then hit them three more times each within 30 seconds to receive the Bride of Frankenstein's microphone. The clock can be reset up to three times during this mode by shooting the center lane.\n* '''Frankenstein Multiball:''' Two standup targets block the center ramp. Repeated hits light the body parts of Frankenstein's monster; once all six are lit, the standups sink below the field and the player can shoot the ramp to start a three-ball multiball. In order to collect the monster's keyboard, the player must score six jackpots by hitting any lit shots and/or a figurine of the monster, which swings down to block the ramp.\n* '''Mummy Mayhem:''' Hit the jet bumpers a set number of times, then shoot the center scoop. In order to light the Mummy's bass guitar, the player must score a set number of points within 45 seconds; all major shots are lit for jackpots. Completing the mode early awards bonus points for any time left on the clock.\n* '''Drac Attack:''' Hit the \"Drac Attack\" standup targets a total of seven times, then shoot the center scoop to start a 30-second timer. The player must then hit a figurine of Dracula as it moves on a curved track, with the timer resetting after each hit. His guitar is awarded after five hits.\n\nThe player can earn \"monster bomb\" items, which can be used to make progress during the associated modes by pressing the ball launch button. Each item is specific to one monster, such as a garlic clove for Dracula or a silver bullet for the Wolf Man.\n\n==Multiballs==\nIn addition to Frankenstein Multiball (see \"Modes\" above), the game includes three other multiballs, all of which are started by shooting the center scoop once they are enabled.\n\n* '''Mosh Pit Multiball:''' Enabled by shooting the center lane a set number of times. All shots are lit for jackpots. This mode starts with two balls; up to two more may be added, one at a time, by shooting the center lane.\n* '''Monster Bash:''' This is a wizard mode that is enabled as soon as the player has started all six modes. A four-ball multiball in which all shots are lit for jackpots. \n* '''Monsters of Rock:''' This is a different wizard mode that is enabled only by lighting all six instruments. The player receives a bonus for all instruments collected, plus an additional bonus for every complete set. A four-ball multiball in which all shots are lit for larger jackpots than those in Monster Bash. If the player starts Monster Bash and collects all remaining instruments while it is in progress, it is immediately replaced by Monsters of Rock.\n\nThe monsters become unlit after playing Monster Bash, while both the monsters and instruments become unlit after playing Monsters of Rock. In both cases, the player can immediately begin making progress toward relighting them.\n\nIf the player starts Frankenstein Multiball, Mosh Pit Multiball, or Monster Bash while any modes are running, the modes continue with their timers frozen as long as two or more balls are on the field.

The game features some [[Universal Monsters]] including The [[Gill-man|Creature from the Black Lagoon]], [[Larry Talbot|The Wolf Man]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Bride of Frankenstein]], [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and [[Imhotep (character)|The Mummy]].\n\n==Description==\nThe main goal of the game is to collect the instruments of the iconic horror characters and form the ''Monsters of Rock'' band.<ref>http://www.pinballrebel.com/game/pins/mb/monster_bash_pinball.html</ref> The table includes a ''Phantom Flip''; when this feature is enabled, the player can let go of the flipper buttons and allow the game to attempt a shot.<ref>http://www.thepaisleys.com/PaisleyPinball/Fixes/phantom_flip.htm</ref><ref>http://www.planetarypinball.com/mm5/Williams/games/bash/features.htm</ref>\n\nThe machine has an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] mode called \u201c''Lyman\u2019s Lament''\u201d.

Each additional shot collects the points and resets the countdown to a higher value. Four hurry-up shots are needed to collect the Wolf Man's drum kit.\n* '''Creature Feature:''' Shoot the Creature's lagoon four times to start a hurry-up, then hit any lit shot (left/right ramps, left/right orbits, center lane) to collect it and start a 20-second timer. The remaining four shots each award increasing multiples of the hurry-up score and reset the timer, and all of them must be made to earn the Creature's saxophone. Shooting the lagoon credits the player with one shot, awards the relevant points, and resets the timer.\n* '''Ball and Chain:''' Shoot the left and right ramps three times each, then hit them three more times each within 30 seconds to receive the Bride of Frankenstein's microphone. The clock can be reset up to three times during this mode by shooting the center lane.\n* '''Frankenstein Multiball:''' Two standup targets block the center ramp. Repeated hits light the body parts of Frankenstein's monster; once all six are lit, the standups sink below the field and the player can shoot the ramp to start a three-ball multiball. In order to collect the monster's keyboard, the player must score six jackpots by hitting any lit shots and/or a figurine of the monster, which swings down to block the ramp.\n* '''Mummy Mayhem:''' Hit the jet bumpers a set number of times, then shoot the center scoop. In order to light the Mummy's bass guitar, the player must score a set number of points within 45 seconds; all major shots are lit for jackpots. Completing the mode early awards bonus points for any time left on the clock.\n* '''Drac Attack:''' Hit the \"Drac Attack\" standup targets a total of seven times, then shoot the center scoop to start a 30-second timer. The player must then hit a figurine of Dracula as it moves on a curved track, with the timer resetting after each hit. His guitar is awarded after five hits.\n\nThe player can earn \"monster bomb\" items, which can be used to make progress during the associated modes by pressing the ball launch button. Each item is specific to one monster, such as a garlic clove for Dracula or a silver bullet for the Wolf Man.\n\n==Multiballs==\nIn addition to Frankenstein Multiball (see \"Modes\" above), the game includes three other multiballs, all of which are started by shooting the center scoop once they are enabled.\n\n* '''Mosh Pit Multiball:''' Enabled by shooting the center lane a set number of times. All shots are lit for jackpots. This mode starts with two balls; up to two more may be added, one at a time, by shooting the center lane.\n* '''Monster Bash:''' This is a wizard mode that is enabled as soon as the player has started all six modes. A four-ball multiball in which all shots are lit for jackpots. \n* '''Monsters of Rock:''' This is a different wizard mode that is enabled only by lighting all six instruments. The player receives a bonus for all instruments collected, plus an additional bonus for every complete set. A four-ball multiball in which all shots are lit for larger jackpots than those in Monster Bash. If the player starts Monster Bash and collects all remaining instruments while it is in progress, it is immediately replaced by Monsters of Rock.\n\nThe monsters become unlit after playing Monster Bash, while both the monsters and instruments become unlit after playing Monsters of Rock. In both cases, the player can immediately begin making progress toward relighting them.\n\nIf the player starts Frankenstein Multiball, Mosh Pit Multiball, or Monster Bash while any modes are running, the modes continue with their timers frozen as long as two or more balls are on the field. Once all balls have drained except one, the timers begin to run again. Monsters of Rock terminates any active modes without completing them.\n\n==Digital versions==\n''Monster Bash'' was formerly available as a table of ''[[The Pinball Arcade]]'' until June 30, 2018 when it was taken down from digital stores after the license expired.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

As with other ambulance services in the [[United Kingdom]], it does not charge its patients directly for its services, but instead receives funding through general [[taxation]]. It responds to medical emergencies in Northern Ireland with the 300-plus ambulance vehicles at its disposal. Its fleet includes mini-buses, ambulance officers' cars, support vehicles, RRVs and accident and emergency ambulances. \n\n==History==\n\nThe Northern Ireland Ambulance Service was formed on 1 April 1995 through the amalgamation of its 4 predecessors<!-- which are? -->. Its full title is the '''Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Health and Social Care Trust'''.\n\n[[File:Belfast (252), October 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Ambulance in Ann Street, Belfast, October 2009]]\n\n==Services==\nThe Service employs approximately 1,300 staff of which approximately 420 are [[Paramedic|Paramedics]], 300 are [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]<nowiki/>s and 100 are [[Emergency control centre|Control staff]], which work shift patterns to ensure the service is operational 24/7. They are based across 46 stations & sub-stations, 2 Control Centres (Emergency and Non-emergency) and a Regional Ambulance Training Centre. It responds to approximately 201,000 emergency (999) calls per year (with the number of 999 calls is increasing per year) with a combination of traditional emergency ambulances with two crew members, and [[Ambulance emergency response vehicle|rapid response vehicles]] (RRVs) crewed by a single paramedic. RRV's respond mostly to calls where there is a potential immediate life-threat (Category A) because they can respond more quickly than a conventional ambulance. Double-crew ambulances respond to both Emergency and Non-emergency (Healthcare Professional-initiated urgent) calls as well as providing critical-care transfers between hospitals. The Trust aims to provide at least one [[Paramedic]] to every emergency call by staffing each double-crew, emergency ambulance with two Paramedics or a Paramedic and an [[Emergency Medical Technician]] and utilising Rapid Response Vehicles. The Trust has not adopted the controversial use of [[Emergency care assistant|ECA's]] in the way many other UK Ambulance Services have.\n\nCurrently in Northern Ireland there is no training programme in any Northern Ireland Universities to train Paramedics.\n\nIn addition to the emergency service, NIAS has a fleet of Patient Care Service vehicles which are used for more routine patient transport to/from hospital. Within the Patient Care Service there are both single-crewed 'sitting case' (minibus) vehicles as well as double-crewed 'intermediate care vehicles' (ICV) which carry a stretcher.\n\nIn 2016 NIAS was commissioned to provide a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) for the first time in Northern Ireland which was by then the only region of the UK not to have one. Following a public consultation, they partnered with the charity [[Air Ambulance Northern Ireland]] who provide the aircraft and airbase, with the doctors and paramedics provided by NIAS.

The Board of Education was asked to employ teachers who were already residents of North Hollywood, creating jobs and education opportunities right in the area. Lankershim High School was renamed '''North Hollywood High School''' in 1929. In 1937, a girls' gymnasium and a second major classroom building, now named Frasher Hall after former principal Roscoe Frasher, were built. In 1950, the third major classroom building, now named Randolph Hall, was built. In the 1950s, many smaller construction projects took place, including the agricultural classrooms, the boys' gymnasium, the home-side bleachers, and the instrumental music room. In 1965, the main hall was named the [[John F. Kennedy]] Memorial Hall after the slain President. In 1966, the cafeteria, student store, and two shop buildings were built. In 1973, the Amelia Earhart Continuation High School was built on the campus' Northeast corner. In the late 1990s, thirteen modular buildings were installed to support an increase in the number of students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/16/news/mn-20297/3|title=L.A.

NHHS is located in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and enrolls approximately 2,500 students each year. Several neighborhoods, including most of [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], [[Valley Village, Los Angeles, California|Valley Village]], [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]] and [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles, California|Sun Valley]], send students to this school. As of 2019, NHHS is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. As of 2019, the [[school principal]] is Mr. Ricardo Rosales.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe campus facilities include three main buildings (Kennedy Hall, Frasher Hall, and Randolph Hall), an agricultural area with livestock, a garden, an auditorium, a cafeteria, two gymnasiums, multiple computer labs with internet access, an auto mechanic shop, a wood shop, an instrumental music room, a football field, two softball fields, a baseball diamond, two tennis court areas, a teachers' parking lot, an art room, a college center, a parent center, a student store, and a library.\n\n==History==\n[[File:NHHS Student Quad.jpg|thumb|''The student quad.'']]\nBuilt in 1927, '''Lankershim High School''' was named for the town of Lankershim (first called Toluca, now North Hollywood) and its founding family. It opened with only a main building, auditorium, gymnasium, and a shop & mechanics building, with 800 students, graduating its first class in 1928. The Board of Education was asked to employ teachers who were already residents of North Hollywood, creating jobs and education opportunities right in the area. Lankershim High School was renamed '''North Hollywood High School''' in 1929. In 1937, a girls' gymnasium and a second major classroom building, now named Frasher Hall after former principal Roscoe Frasher, were built. In 1950, the third major classroom building, now named Randolph Hall, was built. In the 1950s, many smaller construction projects took place, including the agricultural classrooms, the boys' gymnasium, the home-side bleachers, and the instrumental music room. In 1965, the main hall was named the [[John F. Kennedy]] Memorial Hall after the slain President. In 1966, the cafeteria, student store, and two shop buildings were built. In 1973, the Amelia Earhart Continuation High School was built on the campus' Northeast corner. In the late 1990s, thirteen modular buildings were installed to support an increase in the number of students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/16/news/mn-20297/3|title=L.A.

A non-blocking algorithm is '''lock-free''' if there is guaranteed system-wide [[Resource starvation|progress]], and '''wait-free''' if there is also guaranteed per-thread progress.\n\nThe word \"non-blocking\" was traditionally used to describe [[telecommunications network]]s that could route a connection through a set of relays \"without having to re-arrange existing calls\", see [[Clos network]]. Also, if the telephone exchange \"is not defective, it can always make the connection\", see [[nonblocking minimal spanning switch]].\n\n== Motivation ==\n{{Main|Lock (computer science)#Disadvantages|l1=Disadvantages of locks}}\n\nThe traditional approach to multi-threaded programming is to use [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] to synchronize access to shared [[resource (computer science)|resources]]. Synchronization primitives such as [[mutual exclusion|mutexes]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], and [[critical section]]s are all mechanisms by which a programmer can ensure that certain sections of code do not execute concurrently, if doing so would corrupt shared memory structures. If one thread attempts to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, the thread will block until the lock is free.\n\nBlocking a thread can be undesirable for many reasons.  An obvious reason is that while the thread is blocked, it cannot accomplish anything: if the blocked thread had been performing a high-priority or [[real-time computing|real-time]] task, it would be highly undesirable to halt its progress.\n\nOther problems are less obvious.  For example, certain interactions between locks can lead to error conditions such as [[deadlock]], [[livelock]], and [[priority inversion]].  Using locks also involves a trade-off between coarse-grained locking, which can significantly reduce opportunities for [[parallel computing|parallelism]], and fine-grained locking, which requires more careful design, increases locking overhead and is more prone to bugs.\n\nUnlike blocking algorithms, non-blocking algorithms do not suffer from these downsides, and in addition are safe for use in [[interrupt handler]]s: even though the [[Pre-emptive multitasking|preempted]] thread cannot be resumed, progress is still possible without it. In contrast, global data structures protected by mutual exclusion cannot safely be accessed in an interrupt handler, as the preempted thread may be the one holding the lock -- but this can be rectified easily by masking the interrupt request during the critical section.<ref name=\"monit\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/358818.358824 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/lampson/23-ProcessesInMesa/Abstract.html | title = Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa | author = Butler W.

Until recently, all non-blocking algorithms had to be written \"natively\" with the underlying primitives to achieve acceptable performance.

Thus, wait-free implementations are now available for many data-structures.\n\n== Lock-freedom ==\nLock-freedom allows individual threads to starve but guarantees system-wide throughput. An algorithm is lock-free if, when the program threads are run for a sufficiently long time, at least one of the threads makes\nprogress (for some sensible definition of progress).\nAll wait-free algorithms are lock-free.\n\nIn particular, if one thread is suspended, then a lock-free algorithm guarantees that the remaining threads can still make progress.  Hence, if two threads can contend for the same mutex lock or spinlock, then the algorithm is ''not'' lock-free. (If we suspend one thread that holds the lock, then the second thread will block.)\n\nAn algorithm is lock-free if infinitely often operation by some processors will succeed in a finite number of steps. For instance, if N processors are trying to execute an operation, some of the N processes will succeed in finishing the operation in a finite number of steps and others might fail and retry on failure. The difference between wait-free and lock-free is that wait-free operation by each process is guaranteed to succeed in a finite number of steps, regardless of the other processors.\n\nIn general, a lock-free algorithm can run in four phases: completing one's own operation, assisting an obstructing operation, aborting an obstructing operation, and waiting. Completing one's own operation is complicated by the possibility of concurrent assistance and abortion, but is invariably the fastest path to completion.\n\nThe decision about when to assist, abort or wait when an obstruction is met is the responsibility of a ''contention manager''. This may be very simple (assist higher priority operations, abort lower priority ones), or may be more optimized to achieve better throughput, or lower the latency of prioritized operations.\n\nCorrect concurrent assistance is typically the most complex part of a lock-free algorithm, and often very costly to execute: not only does the assisting thread slow down, but thanks to the mechanics of shared memory, the thread being assisted will be slowed, too, if it is still running.\n\n== Obstruction-freedom ==\nObstruction-freedom is the weakest natural non-blocking progress guarantee. An algorithm is obstruction-free if at any point, a single thread executed in isolation (i.e., with all obstructing threads suspended) for a bounded number of steps will complete its operation.<ref name=\"awilliams\" /> All lock-free algorithms are obstruction-free.\n\nObstruction-freedom demands only that any partially completed operation can be aborted and the changes made rolled back. Dropping concurrent assistance can often result in much simpler algorithms that are easier to validate. Preventing the system from continually [[livelock|live-locking]] is the task of a contention manager.\n\nSome obstruction-free algorithms use a pair of \"consistency markers\" in the data structure.  Processes reading the data structure first read one consistency marker, then read the relevant data into an internal buffer, then read the other marker, and then compare the markers.  The data is consistent if the two markers are identical.  Markers may be non-identical when the read is interrupted by another process updating the data structure.  In such a case, the process discards the data in the internal buffer and tries again.\n\n\"Non-blocking\" was used as a synonym for \"lock-free\" in the literature until the introduction of obstruction-freedom in 2003.<ref name=obs-free>{{cite conference|last=Herlihy|first=M.|last2=Luchangco|first2=V.|last3=Moir|first3=M.|title=Obstruction-Free Synchronization: Double-Ended Queues as an Example|conference=23rd [[International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems]]|year=2003|pages=522|url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/mph/HerlihyLM03/main.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Deadlock]]\n* [[Java ConcurrentMap#Lock-free atomicity]]\n* [[Liveness]]\n* [[Lock (software engineering)]]\n* [[Mutual exclusion]]\n* [[Priority inversion]]\n* [[Resource starvation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming/ An Introduction to Lock-Free Programming]\n* [http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/non-blocking-algorithms.html Non-blocking Algorithms]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Non-Blocking Algorithm}}\n[[Category:Synchronization]]\n[[Category:Concurrency control]]\n[[Category:Concurrency control algorithms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Class of algorithms}}\n{{distinguish|Non-blocking I/O}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], an [[algorithm]] is called '''non-blocking''' if failure or [[Scheduling (computing)|suspension]] of any [[thread (computing)|thread]] cannot cause failure or suspension of another thread;<ref>{{cite book|last1=G\u00f6etz|first1=Brian|last2=Peierls|first2=Tim|last3=Bloch|first3=Joshua|last4=Bowbeer|first4=Joseph|last5=Holmes|first5=David|last6=Lea|first6=Doug|title=Java concurrency in practice|date=2006|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=9780321349606|page=[https://archive.org/details/javaconcurrencyi00goet/page/41 41]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/javaconcurrencyi00goet/page/41}}</ref>  for some operations, these algorithms provide a useful alternative to traditional [[lock (computer science)|blocking implementations]]. A non-blocking algorithm is '''lock-free''' if there is guaranteed system-wide [[Resource starvation|progress]], and '''wait-free''' if there is also guaranteed per-thread progress.\n\nThe word \"non-blocking\" was traditionally used to describe [[telecommunications network]]s that could route a connection through a set of relays \"without having to re-arrange existing calls\", see [[Clos network]]. Also, if the telephone exchange \"is not defective, it can always make the connection\", see [[nonblocking minimal spanning switch]].\n\n== Motivation ==\n{{Main|Lock (computer science)#Disadvantages|l1=Disadvantages of locks}}\n\nThe traditional approach to multi-threaded programming is to use [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] to synchronize access to shared [[resource (computer science)|resources]]. Synchronization primitives such as [[mutual exclusion|mutexes]], [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], and [[critical section]]s are all mechanisms by which a programmer can ensure that certain sections of code do not execute concurrently, if doing so would corrupt shared memory structures. If one thread attempts to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, the thread will block until the lock is free.\n\nBlocking a thread can be undesirable for many reasons.  An obvious reason is that while the thread is blocked, it cannot accomplish anything: if the blocked thread had been performing a high-priority or [[real-time computing|real-time]] task, it would be highly undesirable to halt its progress.\n\nOther problems are less obvious.  For example, certain interactions between locks can lead to error conditions such as [[deadlock]], [[livelock]], and [[priority inversion]].  Using locks also involves a trade-off between coarse-grained locking, which can significantly reduce opportunities for [[parallel computing|parallelism]], and fine-grained locking, which requires more careful design, increases locking overhead and is more prone to bugs.\n\nUnlike blocking algorithms, non-blocking algorithms do not suffer from these downsides, and in addition are safe for use in [[interrupt handler]]s: even though the [[Pre-emptive multitasking|preempted]] thread cannot be resumed, progress is still possible without it. In contrast, global data structures protected by mutual exclusion cannot safely be accessed in an interrupt handler, as the preempted thread may be the one holding the lock -- but this can be rectified easily by masking the interrupt request during the critical section<ref name=\"monit\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/358818.358824 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/lampson/23-ProcessesInMesa/Abstract.html | title = Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa | author = Butler W.

'For the last 10 years he has been more angry and vituperative, and that cannot have failed to be noticed.' However, Mr Jenkins insists that, though Pinter's political views may have been a factor, the award is more than justified on artistic criteria alone.

However, [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]] were the first proponents of the successful V-A (vector minus axial vector, or left-handed) theory for weak interactions in 1957. It was essentially the same theory as that proposed by [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Murray Gell-Mann]] in their \"mathematical physics\" paper on the structure of the [[weak interaction]]. Actually, Gell-Mann had been let in on the Sudarshan/Marshak work on Sudarshan's initiative,<ref name=\"Rothman\"/> but no acknowledgment appeared in the later paper, except for an informal allusion. The reason given was that the originators' work had not been published in a formal or 'reputable enough' science journal at the time. The theory is popularly known in the west as the Feynman-Gell-Mann theory.<ref name=\"V-A\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090207164536/http://www.ph.utexas.edu/fogs/sudarshan_vminusa.html Sudarshan: Seven Science Quests]. ph.utexas.edu.</ref> The V-A theory for weak interactions was, in effect, a new Law of Nature. It was conceived in the face of a series of apparently contradictory experimental results, including several from [[Chien-Shiung Wu]]. It was also aided along by a sprinkling of other evidence, like the [[muon]].

The joint winners, [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], had their discovery elucidated by others. Many scientists felt that [[Ralph Alpher]], who predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation and in 1948 worked out the underpinnings of the [[Big Bang theory]], should have shared in the prize or received one independently. In 2005, Alpher received the [[National Medal of Science]] for his pioneering contributions to understanding of [[nucleosynthesis]], the prediction of the relic radiation from the Big Bang, as well as for a model for the Big Bang.\n\n;1974\nThe 1974 prize went to [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] \"for their pioneering research in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular of the [[aperture synthesis]] technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the discovery of [[pulsar]]s\". Hewish was not the first to correctly explain pulsars, initially describing them as communications from \"Little Green Men\" ([[LGM-1]]) in outer space. David Staelin and Edward Reifenstein, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, found a pulsar at the centre of the [[Crab Nebula]]. The notion that pulsars were [[neutron star]]s, leftovers from a [[supernova]] explosion, had been proposed in 1933. Soon after their 1967 discovery, [[Fred Hoyle]] and astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] correctly explained it as a rapidly spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field, emitting radio waves. [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], Hewish's graduate student, was not recognized, although she was the first to notice the stellar radio source that was later recognized as a pulsar.<ref name=\"Sharon\">Sharon Bertsch McGrayne (1998) ''Nobel Prize Women in Science: Their Lives, Struggles and Momentous Discoveries'', Carol Pub.

However, Brazilian physicist [[C\u00e9sar Lattes]] was the main researcher and the first author of the historical ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal article describing the [[subatomic particle]] [[meson]] pi ([[pion]]). Lattes was solely responsible for the improvement of the nuclear emulsion used by Powell (by asking [[Kodak]] Co. to add more [[boron]] to it\u2014and in 1947, he made with them his great experimental discovery). This result was explained by the Nobel Committee policy (ended in 1960) to award the prize to the research group head only. Lattes calculated the pion's mass and, with USA physicist Eugene Gardner, demonstrated the existence of this particle after atomic collisions in a [[synchrotron]]. Gardner was denied a prize because he died soon thereafter.\n\n;1938\nThe 1938 prize went to [[Enrico Fermi]] in part for \"his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation\". However, in this case, the award later appeared to be premature: Fermi thought he had created [[transuranic element]]s (specifically, [[hesperium]]), but had in fact unwittingly demonstrated [[nuclear fission]] (and had actually created only [[fission products]]\u2014isotopes of much lighter elements than uranium). The fact that Fermi's interpretation was incorrect was discovered shortly after he had received his prize.\n\n;1936\nThe 1936 prize went to [[Carl D. Anderson]] for the discovery of the positron. While a graduate student at Caltech in 1930, [[Chung-Yao Chao]] was the first to experimentally identify [[positron]]s through [[electron\u2013positron annihilation]], but did not realize what they were. Anderson, Chao's classmate at Caltech, used the same [[radioactive]] source, [[Thallium-208|{{chem|208|Tl}}]], as Chao. (Historically, {{chem|208|Tl}} was known as \"thorium C double prime\" or \"ThC\", see [[decay chain]]s.)

The Nobel committee passed on several nominations for his many other seminal contributions, although these led to prizes for others who later applied more advanced technology to experimentally verify his work, most notably the 2017 prize awarded to the heads of [[LIGO]]. Many predictions of Einstein's theories have been verified as technology advances. Recent examples include the bending of light in a [[gravitational field]], [[gravitational wave]]s (detected by [[LIGO]]), [[gravitational lens]]ing and [[black hole]]s. It wasn't until 1993 that the first evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation came via the Nobel Prize-winning measurements of the [[Hulse\u2013Taylor binary]] system.<ref>\"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060914094623.htm General Relativity Survives Gruelling Pulsar Test: Einstein At Least 99.95 Percent Right]\", Particle Physics & Astronomy Research Council, 14 September 2006.</ref>\n\nThe committee also failed to recognize the other contributions of his [[Annus Mirabilis papers]] on [[Brownian motion]] and [[special relativity]].

[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] was also nominated at least once for his work, including on Lorentz's relativity theory. However, [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann's]] then-experimental results (incorrectly) cast doubt on Special Relativity. These doubts were not resolved until 1915. By this time, Einstein had progressed to his [[general theory of relativity]], including his theory of gravitation. Empirical support\u2014in this case the predicted spectral shift of sunlight\u2014was in question for many decades. The only piece of original evidence was the consistency with the known [[perihelion]] precession of the planet Mercury. Some additional support was gained at the end of 1919, when the predicted deflection of starlight near the sun was confirmed by [[Arthur Eddington]]'s Solar Eclipse Expedition, though here again the actual results were somewhat ambiguous. Conclusive proof of the gravitational light deflection prediction was not achieved until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Atalla1963.png|thumb|[[Mohamed M.

Banting felt that [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] was the proper corecipient, while Macleod had merely given them lab space at the [[University of Toronto]] while Macleod was away for the summer. However, on his return, Macleod pointed out some flaws in their experimental design and gave them advice about directions to work in. Banting's original method of isolating insulin required performing surgery on living dogs, which was too labor-intensive to produce insulin on a large scale. Best then set about finding a biochemical extraction method, while [[James Bertram Collip]], a chemistry professor on sabbatical from the [[University of Alberta]], joined Macleod's team and worked in parallel with Best. The two of them succeeded within days of each other. When Banting agreed to receive the prize, he decided to give half of his prize money to Best.

As a poet, screenwriter and author of more than 30 plays, he has dominated the English literary scene for half a century. However, his outspoken criticism of US [[foreign policy]] and opposition to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the war in Iraq]] undoubtedly make him one of the more controversial figures to be awarded this prestigious honour. Indeed, the Nobel academy's decision can be read to have an inescapably political element. 'There is the view that the Nobel Literature Prize often goes to someone whose political stance is found to be sympathetic at a given moment,' said Alan Jenkins, deputy editor of [[the Times Literary Supplement]]. 'For the last 10 years he has been more angry and vituperative, and that cannot have failed to be noticed.' However, Mr Jenkins insists that, though Pinter's political views may have been a factor, the award is more than justified on artistic criteria alone. 'His dramatic and literary achievement is head and shoulders above any other British writer. He is far and away the most interesting, the best, the most powerful and most original of English playwrights.'}}</ref> Although poor health prevented him from giving his controversial Nobel Lecture, \"[[Art, Truth and Politics]]\", in person, he appeared on video, which was simultaneously transmitted on Britain's [[Channel Four]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ Harold Pinter \u2013Nobel Lecture].

Many scientists felt that [[Ralph Alpher]], who predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation and in 1948 worked out the underpinnings of the [[Big Bang theory]], should have shared in the prize or received one independently. In 2005, Alpher received the [[National Medal of Science]] for his pioneering contributions to understanding of [[nucleosynthesis]], the prediction of the relic radiation from the Big Bang, as well as for a model for the Big Bang.\n\n;1974\nThe 1974 prize went to [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] \"for their pioneering research in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular of the [[aperture synthesis]] technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the discovery of [[pulsar]]s\". Hewish was not the first to correctly explain pulsars, initially describing them as communications from \"Little Green Men\" ([[LGM-1]]) in outer space. David Staelin and Edward Reifenstein, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, found a pulsar at the centre of the [[Crab Nebula]]. The notion that pulsars were [[neutron star]]s, leftovers from a [[supernova]] explosion, had been proposed in 1933. Soon after their 1967 discovery, [[Fred Hoyle]] and astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] correctly explained it as a rapidly spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field, emitting radio waves.

However, Brazilian physicist [[C\u00e9sar Lattes]] was the main researcher and the first author of the historical ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal article describing the [[subatomic particle]] [[meson]] pi ([[pion]]). Lattes was solely responsible for the improvement of the nuclear emulsion used by Powell (by asking [[Kodak]] Co. to add more [[boron]] to it\u2014and in 1947, he made with them his great experimental discovery). This result was explained by the Nobel Committee policy (ended in 1960) to award the prize to the research group head only. Lattes calculated the pion's mass and, with USA physicist Eugene Gardner, demonstrated the existence of this particle after atomic collisions in a [[synchrotron]]. Gardner was denied a prize because he died soon thereafter.\n\n;1938\nThe 1938 prize went to [[Enrico Fermi]] in part for \"his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation\". However, in this case, the award later appeared to be premature: Fermi thought he had created [[transuranic element]]s (specifically, [[hesperium]]), but had in fact unwittingly demonstrated [[nuclear fission]] (and had actually created only [[fission products]]\u2014isotopes of much lighter elements than uranium). The fact that Fermi's interpretation was incorrect was discovered shortly after he had received his prize.\n\n;1936\nThe 1936 prize went to [[Carl D. Anderson]] for the discovery of the positron. While a graduate student at Caltech in 1930, [[Chung-Yao Chao]] was the first to experimentally identify [[positron]]s through [[electron\u2013positron annihilation]], but did not realize what they were. Anderson, Chao's classmate at Caltech, used the same [[radioactive]] source, [[Thallium-208|{{chem|208|Tl}}]], as Chao. (Historically, {{chem|208|Tl}} was known as \"thorium C double prime\" or \"ThC\", see [[decay chain]]s.) Fifty years later, Anderson admitted that Chao had inspired his discovery: Chao's research formed the foundation from which much of Anderson's own work developed.

Some controversy, however, still seems to linger over Millikan's oil-drop procedure and experimental interpretation, over whether Millikan manipulated his data in the 1913 scientific paper measuring the electron charge.

The Nobel committee passed on several nominations for his many other seminal contributions, although these led to prizes for others who later applied more advanced technology to experimentally verify his work, most notably the 2017 prize awarded to the heads of [[LIGO]]. Many predictions of Einstein's theories have been verified as technology advances. Recent examples include the bending of light in a [[gravitational field]], [[gravitational wave]]s (detected by [[LIGO]]), [[gravitational lens]]ing and [[black hole]]s.

[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] was also nominated at least once for his work, including on Lorentz's relativity theory. However, [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann's]] then-experimental results (incorrectly) cast doubt on Special Relativity. These doubts were not resolved until 1915. By this time, Einstein had progressed to his [[general theory of relativity]], including his theory of gravitation. Empirical support\u2014in this case the predicted spectral shift of sunlight\u2014was in question for many decades. The only piece of original evidence was the consistency with the known [[perihelion]] precession of the planet Mercury. Some additional support was gained at the end of 1919, when the predicted deflection of starlight near the sun was confirmed by [[Arthur Eddington]]'s Solar Eclipse Expedition, though here again the actual results were somewhat ambiguous.

Banting clearly deserved the prize, however, the choice of Macleod as co-winner was controversial. Banting felt that [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] was the proper corecipient, while Macleod had merely given them lab space at the [[University of Toronto]] while Macleod was away for the summer. However, on his return, Macleod pointed out some flaws in their experimental design and gave them advice about directions to work in. Banting's original method of isolating insulin required performing surgery on living dogs, which was too labor-intensive to produce insulin on a large scale. Best then set about finding a biochemical extraction method, while [[James Bertram Collip]], a chemistry professor on sabbatical from the [[University of Alberta]], joined Macleod's team and worked in parallel with Best. The two of them succeeded within days of each other. When Banting agreed to receive the prize, he decided to give half of his prize money to Best. Macleod, in turn, split his half of the prize money with Collip.<ref name=\"bliss1982\">{{cite book|last1=Bliss|first1=Michael|title=The Discovery of Insulin|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226058972|url=https://archive.org/details/discoveryofinsul00blis}}</ref>\n\nSince the Toronto team had isolated insulin from the pancreas, many researchers who had worked with pancreatic extracts claimed to have discovered insulin before the Prize winners.

However, their interpretation of discoveries were directly in opposition. Much as Golgi made significant contributions to the techniques in the study of nervous system in terms of actual structure, he made a completely erroneous conclusion that nervous system is nothing but a single continuous network, the notion called [[reticular theory]]. On the other hand, Ram\u00f3n y Cajal described nervous system as composed of interlinking nerve cells or [[neuron]]s as suggested by a theory called the [[neuron doctrine]]. Golgi strongly advocated the reticular theory such that even his Nobel lecture was a direct attack on Cajal's work and the neuron doctrine, and even depicted a diagram of continuous network which he claimed was \"an exact reproduction after life\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Golgi|first1=Camillo|title=The Neuron Doctrine \u2013 Theory and Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/golgi-lecture.pdf|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Raviola|first1=Elio|last2=Mazzarello|first2=Paolo|title=The diffuse nervous network of Camillo Golgi: Facts and fiction|journal=Brain Research Reviews|year=2011|volume=66|issue=1\u20132|pages=75\u201382|doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.09.005|pmid=20840856}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bock|first1=Ortwin|title=Cajal, Golgi, Nansen, Sch\u00e4fer and the Neuron Doctrine|journal=Endeavour|year=2013|volume=37|issue=4|pages=228\u2013234|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.06.006|pmid=23870749}}</ref> Therefore, recognising a work on wrong conclusion is inappropriate.
