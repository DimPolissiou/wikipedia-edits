It is about two 13-year-old best friends, Jim Nightshade and William Halloway, and their nightmarish experience with a [[traveling carnival]] that comes to their [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] home, Green Town, Illinois, on October 23rd. In dealing with the creepy figures of this carnival, the boys learn how to combat fear. The carnival's leader is the mysterious \"Mr. Dark\", who seemingly wields the power to grant the citizenry's secret desires. In reality, Dark is a malevolent being who, like the carnival, lives off the life force of those they enslave. Mr. Dark's presence is countered by that of Will's father, Charles Halloway, the janitor of the town library, who harbors his own secret fear of growing older because he feels he is too old to be Will's dad.\n\nThe novel combines elements of [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]], analyzing the conflicting natures of good and evil which exist within all individuals. Unlike many of Bradbury's other novel-length works, such as ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'' and ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'',  which are [[fix-up]]s, ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' is a single, full-length narrative.\n\nThe title is taken from \"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes\", a line said by the witches in ''[[Macbeth]]''.\n\n==Background==\nOne of the events in Ray Bradbury's childhood that inspired him to become a writer was an encounter with a carnival magician named Mr. Electrico who commanded him to \"Live forever!\" The 12-year-old Bradbury, intrigued at the concept of eternal life, revisited Mr. Electrico, who spurred his passion for life by heralding him as the reincarnation of a friend lost in [[World War I]]. After that memorable day, Bradbury began writing nonstop.<ref>Bradbury, Ray. [http://www.raybradbury.com/inhiswords02.html In His Words]. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe novel originated in 1955 when Bradbury suggested to his friend [[Gene Kelly]] that they collaborate on a movie for Kelly to direct. Kelly was encouraging of the idea, and Bradbury spent the next five weeks adapting his 1948 short story \"The Black Ferris\" into an 80-page treatment.<ref>{{cite book| first = Ray| last = Bradbury| title = Something Wicked This Way Comes| location = | publisher = Avon| year = 1997| isbn = 0-380-72940-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/292 292]| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/292}}</ref> Kelly shopped the project to various studios, but was unable to obtain financial backing for the movie. Bradbury then gradually expanded the treatment into the novel over a five-year period. He converted the benign presence of Mr. Electrico into a more sinister one and incorporated several members he met at the same carnival with Mr. Electrico, including the Illustrated Man and the Skeleton Man.<ref>{{cite book| first = Ray| last = Bradbury| title = Something Wicked This Way Comes| location = | publisher = Avon| year = 1998| isbn = 0-380-72940-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/304 304]| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/304}}</ref>\n\nThe book's autumnal setting was intended as a thematic sequel to Bradbury's summer-tinged'' [[Dandelion Wine]]''. Both works are set in the fictitious Green Town (based on Bradbury's hometown, [[Waukegan, Illinois]]) but have different tones, with the seasons in which they are set reflecting different aspects of the transition from childhood to adulthood. While none of the characters in ''Dandelion Wine'' reappear in ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'', Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade can be viewed as one-year older representations of ''Dandelion Wine''&apos;s Douglas Spaulding and John Huff, respectively.<ref>Reid, Robin Anne (2000). ''Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion''. Greenwood Press, pp. 73.</ref> These two novels, coupled with Bradbury's official 2006 sequel to ''Dandelion Wine'', ''[[Farewell Summer]]'', constitute what Bradbury has termed his \"Green Town Trilogy\". The 2008 short story collection ''[[Summer Morning, Summer Night]]'' is also set in Green Town.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2019}}\nThe novel opens on an overcast October 23. Two friends - William \"Will\" Halloway and Jim Nightshade - both on the verge of their fourteenth birthdays, encounter a strange lightning rod salesman, Tom Fury. He announces that a storm is coming their way. The salesman gives Jim a lightning rod because he tells the boys that one of their houses is in danger and they do not have money to buy one. Throughout the night, Will and Jim meet up with townsfolk who also sense something in the air: The barber says that it smells of cotton candy and licorice. Among the townspeople is Will's 54-year-old father, Charles Halloway, who works in the local library, and who broods philosophically about life and the past. Both Mr. Halloway and the boys learn about the carnival that is to start the next day. Will's father sees a sign in a store window that advertises Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, while Jim and Will find a similar handbill in the street. They are excited that a carnival has come so late in the year, but Charles Halloway has a bad feeling about it.\n\nThe boys run out to watch the carnival arrive at three in the morning. As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. Mr. Halloway talks about this time of night as \"soul's midnight\", when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's abandoned bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel, which has an out-of-order sign. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to put them down, introducing himself as Mr. Dark and says that the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel.  They run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock, he is twelve years old.\n \nThey follow young Mr. Cooger to Miss Foley's house, where he pretends to be the nephew she was expecting. Jim tries to talk with him, because he wants to ride the carousel, but Will stops him. Jim takes off in the direction of the carnival. When Will catches up, Mr. Cooger is riding the carousel growing older, and Jim is about to join him. Will knocks the switch on the carousel and it flies out of control, spinning rapidly forward. Mr. Cooger ages over 100 years before it stops, and Jim and Will take off. They return with the police, but Mr. Cooger is nowhere to be found. Inside the tents they find him all set up as a new act, \"Mr. Electrico\", a man they run electricity through. Mr. Dark tells the boys to come back to the carnival the next day. Will tries to keep his father out of the situation, promising him that he will tell all soon. That night, the Dust Witch floats by in her balloon to find Jim and Will. Will lures her to an abandoned house and destroys her balloon with a bow and arrow. They later both dream of a bizarre funeral for the balloon, featuring a giant, misshapen coffin.\n \nThe next day the boys find a girl crying on the curb and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The carnival is out searching the streets for the two of them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Halloway pretends not to know the two boys, whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her, choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Halloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves in the midst of a giant storm. Mr. Dark appears, and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Halloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Halloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.\n \nAt the carnival, Charles triumphs over Mr. Dark, finds his son in the mirror maze, kills the Witch with a smile on a bullet, and destroys all the mirrors in a matter of minutes, all through the use of laughter and cheer. Then he and Will search for Jim. Mr. Cooger turns to dust and blows away before he can be saved by the carousel. Jim runs to the merry-go-round and rides it forward. Will tries to stop him and grabs onto his leg.  They both end up going for a ride before Will jumps off and rips Jim away from the machine. Jim falls into a stupor, close to death. A child comes begging them to help him, but Mr. Halloway recognizes the boy as Mr. Dark. He holds the boy tight and kills him with affection, because Mr. Dark cannot survive in such close contact with someone so happy. The carnival falls apart as Will tries to revive Jim. They save Jim by singing and dancing and laughing, their happiness bringing him back from the edge of death.\n\n==Characters==\n;William \"Will\" Halloway\n:Born one minute before midnight on October 30, Will is described as having done \"only six years of staring.\" (He is described as having white-blonde hair with eyes \"as clear as summer rain\".) Will is naturally obedient and wary of getting involved in difficult situations; nonetheless, he takes on an active role in fighting the carnival's evil power.\n;James \"Jim\" Nightshade\n:Born one minute after midnight on October 31, Jim is brooding and brash, acting as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] for Will's cautiousness and practicality. (He is described as having wild and tangled chestnut brown hair and eyes the color of \"green-glass fire.\") Jim yearns to become older, which makes him vulnerable to the carnival's temptations, but he is ultimately saved by his friendship with Will.\n;Charles Halloway\n:A middle-aged man who starts out in the novel as quiet and unhappy. He's not very close to his son, but eventually gains self-awareness and faith while up against the carnival (defeating the \"Dust Witch\" and \"Jed/Mr. Dark\").  He becomes a fighter in his own right by the end of the novel, along with gaining the admiration, love, and friendship of his son.\n;G. M. Dark\n:The main antagonist, he is a sinister man who bears tattoos all over his body, one for each person successfully tempted into joining the carnival. Mr. Dark initially holds sway over the other main characters, but his power weakens when Charles uses positive emotions against him, something he cannot comprehend or withstand. Dark's background is a mystery, although when asked if he reads the Bible, he replies, \"I've had every page, line and word read at me, sir!\" This could refer to a possible Christian upbringing, or his victims quoting.  \n;J. C. Cooger\n:Dark's partner in running the carnival, Mr. Cooger, is a fierce, red-headed man who is first seen repairing the carousel. He catches and terrifies Will and Jim until Mr. Dark intervenes. In the guise of her twelve-year-old nephew, he is able to persuade Miss Foley to come to the carnival. The tables are turned on him, however, when Will increases the speed of the carousel as Mr. Cooger is riding it, causing him to rapidly age to the point of decrepitude.  At the climax of the book he crumbles into dust and dies when the freaks accidentally drop him while carrying him back to the carousel. Like Mr. Dark, his origins are unknown.\n;The Dust Witch\n:A blind soothsayer possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]] and the ability to perform many feats of magic, the Witch is portrayed as one of the carnival's most dangerous members. However, her increased sensitivity to the presence and emotions of other people makes her vulnerable to positive feelings. Charles uses this weakness to kill her with a bullet carved with a smile.  Her origins are unknown, but she is illustrated on Mr. Dark's wrist as a \"black-nun blind woman\". \n;Miss Foley\n:A fifty-year-old schoolteacher of Will and Jim. Much like the other victims of the carnival, Miss Foley wished to become young. Her wish is granted, although she is transformed into a little girl with all her memories intact, unable to return to her former life and with no one to take care of her. It is not stated in the novel what happened to Miss Foley at the end.\n;The Skeleton\n:An extremely thin, skeleton-like creature who is one of the more frequently appearing freaks. Like all of the other freaks, he once desired to be younger and was eventually tricked into joining the carnival. The Skeleton appears to be one of the more loyal freaks as, near the book's end, he takes the time to carry the recently deceased and young Mr. Dark with him after all the other freaks ran away. He is last seen walking away into the hills that border the town.\n;Tom Fury/Dwarf\n:A lightning rod salesman who, succumbing to his desire to see the Most Beautiful Woman in the World, is turned into an insane dwarf by the carnival and is recruited into it, with no memories of his former life.\n\n==Themes==\n\n\n\n\n===Structure of the novel===\n''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' can be interpreted as an [[allegory]] of the struggle between [[good and evil]], with the human characters Will, Jim, and Charles on the side of morality and Mr. Dark and his carnival on the side of sin and [[temptation]]. As in many other fictional works revolving around the same concept, good prevails in the end, not with supernatural or physical powers, but with purity of heart. Jim represents good that is always on the verge of giving into temptation, while Will, though he has crises and doubts, is the part of human nature that resists giving in.\n\nAs in ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', Bradbury infuses the novel with [[nostalgia]] for his childhood. However, ''Dandelion Wine'' embodies the idyllic memories of youth, whereas ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' superimposes folk-tale and supernatural elements over a small-town Americana setting in order to explore the dark undercurrents that surround the transition to adulthood.<ref>Attebery, Brian (1980). ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature: From Irving to Le Guin''. Indiana University Press, pp. 136-140.</ref>\n\n===Transition from childhood to adulthood===\nThe carnival's main allure to its participants is its ability to change age easily against natural causes. Jim wants to become an adult by riding the carousel forward while Charles Halloway initially considers riding the carousel backwards. Even Will is somewhat tempted by the offer for a free trip to adulthood.\n\nCharles, however, quickly sees that a ride on the carousel can have unforeseen consequences, because despite age being changed instantly, the carousel would not change the mind of its riders. \n\"If I made you twenty-five tomorrow, Jim, your thoughts would still be boy thoughts, and it'd show! Or if they turned ''me'' into a boy of ten this instant, my brain would still be fifty and that boy would act funnier and older and weirder than any boy ever.\"<ref>{{cite book| first = Ray| last = Bradbury| title = Something Wicked This Way Comes| location = | publisher = Avon| year = 1998| pages = | isbn = 0-380-72940-7| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0}}</ref>\n\nBecause of this effect, a person who rode the carousel would be reformed only physically, with the same sins and emotions contained inside. Moreover, a carousel rider's new physical form, created unnaturally, would alienate them from his or her family and peers, leaving the person with nowhere to turn for acceptance except for the carnival itself.\n\nCharles best personifies this theme; while he is middle-aged in body, he is still youthful in mind and spirit. At first, he sees the two conflicting personas within him as irreconcilable and longs to be physically young too, but his active participation in toppling the carnival proves to him that mental fitness and perception of one's age is more important than physical health.\n\nWill and Jim can be said to have aged prematurely in the novel; the horrors of the carnival force them to grow up fast to be able to deal with its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim do take a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow up slightly. In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables them to grow more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.\n\n===Belief and fear===\nThe novel also conveys the theme that the power of people, objects, and ideas have over you depends on the power you instill in them with your own mind. Because of this, the carnival is able to easily take advantage of the common human fears of aging, death, and loneliness which everyone has or relates to.<ref>Kailua, Dylan S. [http://teenink.com/Past/2006/May/20241.html \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" Book Review]. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\nCharles Halloway is the character who learns the most about this; he initially views death as unpleasant and it thus becomes a sinister force to him that the Mirror Maze magnifies. However, Will's words of love help him to see that age does not matter if one focuses instead on the knowledge and affections gained with it, and as his fear vanishes, so does the Mirror Maze. He also is able to defeat the Dust Witch once he realizes that she does not have ultimate control over him. With his belief in her powers gone, he turns the tables on the Witch by instilling the same fear in her of his smile that he used to have of her magic.\n\n===Viewpoint on life===\nSelf-centered desires and wishes are portrayed as the base of human malice and unhappiness because they blind people to the blessings of life with an unattainable dream. The novel's main example of this is Miss Foley's seduction by Cooger's promise of youth that causes her to fail to see his deception as her \"nephew,\" and lose her rightful place in society.<ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/somethingwicked/essay1.html The Perils of Adulthood in 'Something Wicked This Way Comes']. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\nIt is implied that the counter-force against this is acceptance of one's faults and an enthusiastic pursuit of the everyday joys of life, signified by Charles' spontaneous running with Jim and Will at the end of the novel. The fact that he is nearly forty years older than them pales in comparison to the pleasure he gains from simple human companionship.<ref>Reid, Robin Anne (2000).

It is about two 13-year-old best friends, Jim Nightshade and William Halloway, and their nightmarish experience with a [[traveling carnival]] that comes to their [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] home, Green Town, Illinois, on October 23rd. In dealing with the creepy figures of this carnival, the boys learn how to combat fear. The carnival's leader is the mysterious \"Mr. Dark\", who seemingly wields the power to grant the citizenry's secret desires. In reality, Dark is a malevolent being who, like the carnival, lives off the life force of those they enslave. Mr. Dark's presence is countered by that of Will's father, Charles Halloway, the janitor of the town library, who harbors his own secret fear of growing older because he feels he is too old to be Will's dad.\n\nThe novel combines elements of [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]], analyzing the conflicting natures of good and evil which exist within all individuals. Unlike many of Bradbury's other novel-length works, such as ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'' and ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'',  which are [[fix-up]]s, ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' is a single, full-length narrative.\n\nThe title is taken from \"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes\", a line said by the witches in ''[[Macbeth]]''.\n\n==Background==\nOne of the events in Ray Bradbury's childhood that inspired him to become a writer was an encounter with a carnival magician named Mr. Electrico who commanded him to \"Live forever!\" The 12-year-old Bradbury, intrigued at the concept of eternal life, revisited Mr. Electrico, who spurred his passion for life by heralding him as the reincarnation of a friend lost in [[World War I]]. After that memorable day, Bradbury began writing nonstop.<ref>Bradbury, Ray. [http://www.raybradbury.com/inhiswords02.html In His Words]. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe novel originated in 1955 when Bradbury suggested to his friend [[Gene Kelly]] that they collaborate on a movie for Kelly to direct. Kelly was encouraging of the idea, and Bradbury spent the next five weeks adapting his 1948 short story \"The Black Ferris\" into an 80-page treatment.<ref>{{cite book| first = Ray| last = Bradbury| title = Something Wicked This Way Comes| location = | publisher = Avon| year = 1997| isbn = 0-380-72940-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/292 292]| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/292}}</ref> Kelly shopped the project to various studios, but was unable to obtain financial backing for the movie. Bradbury then gradually expanded the treatment into the novel over a five-year period. He converted the benign presence of Mr. Electrico into a more sinister one and incorporated several members he met at the same carnival with Mr. Electrico, including the Illustrated Man and the Skeleton Man.<ref>{{cite book| first = Ray| last = Bradbury| title = Something Wicked This Way Comes| location = | publisher = Avon| year = 1998| isbn = 0-380-72940-7| page = [https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/304 304]| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0/page/304}}</ref>\n\nThe book's autumnal setting was intended as a thematic sequel to Bradbury's summer-tinged'' [[Dandelion Wine]]''. Both works are set in the fictitious Green Town (based on Bradbury's hometown, [[Waukegan, Illinois]]) but have different tones, with the seasons in which they are set reflecting different aspects of the transition from childhood to adulthood. While none of the characters in ''Dandelion Wine'' reappear in ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'', Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade can be viewed as one-year older representations of ''Dandelion Wine''&apos;s Douglas Spaulding and John Huff, respectively.<ref>Reid, Robin Anne (2000). ''Ray Bradbury: A Critical Companion''. Greenwood Press, pp. 73.</ref> These two novels, coupled with Bradbury's official 2006 sequel to ''Dandelion Wine'', ''[[Farewell Summer]]'', constitute what Bradbury has termed his \"Green Town Trilogy\". The 2008 short story collection ''[[Summer Morning, Summer Night]]'' is also set in Green Town.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2019}}\nThe novel opens on an overcast October 23. Two friends - William \"Will\" Halloway and Jim Nightshade - both on the verge of their fourteenth birthdays, encounter a strange lightning rod salesman, Tom Fury. He announces that a storm is coming their way. The salesman gives Jim a lightning rod because he tells the boys that one of their houses is in danger and they do not have money to buy one. Throughout the night, Will and Jim meet up with townsfolk who also sense something in the air: The barber says that it smells of cotton candy and licorice. Among the townspeople is Will's 54-year-old father, Charles Halloway, who works in the local library, and who broods philosophically about life and the past. Both Mr. Halloway and the boys learn about the carnival that is to start the next day. Will's father sees a sign in a store window that advertises Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, while Jim and Will find a similar handbill in the street. They are excited that a carnival has come so late in the year, but Charles Halloway has a bad feeling about it.\n\nThe boys run out to watch the carnival arrive at three in the morning. As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. Mr. Halloway talks about this time of night as \"soul's midnight\", when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's abandoned bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel, which has an out-of-order sign. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to put them down, introducing himself as Mr. Dark and says that the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel.  They run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock, he is twelve years old.\n \nThey follow young Mr. Cooger to Miss Foley's house, where he pretends to be the nephew she was expecting. Jim tries to talk with him, because he wants to ride the carousel, but Will stops him. Jim takes off in the direction of the carnival. When Will catches up, Mr. Cooger is riding the carousel growing older, and Jim is about to join him. Will knocks the switch on the carousel and it flies out of control, spinning rapidly forward. Mr. Cooger ages over 100 years before it stops, and Jim and Will take off. They return with the police, but Mr. Cooger is nowhere to be found. Inside the tents they find him all set up as a new act, \"Mr. Electrico\", a man they run electricity through. Mr. Dark tells the boys to come back to the carnival the next day. Will tries to keep his father out of the situation, promising him that he will tell all soon. That night, the Dust Witch floats by in her balloon to find Jim and Will. Will lures her to an abandoned house and destroys her balloon with a bow and arrow. They later both dream of a bizarre funeral for the balloon, featuring a giant, misshapen coffin.\n \nThe next day the boys find a girl crying on the curb and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The carnival is out searching the streets for the two of them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Halloway pretends not to know the two boys, whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her, choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Halloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves in the midst of a giant storm. Mr. Dark appears, and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Halloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Halloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.\n \nAt the carnival, Charles triumphs over Mr. Dark, finds his son in the mirror maze, kills the Witch with a smile on a bullet, and destroys all the mirrors in a matter of minutes, all through the use of laughter and cheer. Then he and Will search for Jim. Mr. Cooger turns to dust and blows away before he can be saved by the carousel. Jim runs to the merry-go-round and rides it forward. Will tries to stop him and grabs onto his leg.  They both end up going for a ride before Will jumps off and rips Jim away from the machine. Jim falls into a stupor, close to death. A child comes begging them to help him, but Mr. Halloway recognizes the boy as Mr. Dark. He holds the boy tight and kills him with affection, because Mr. Dark cannot survive in such close contact with someone so happy. The carnival falls apart as Will tries to revive Jim. They save Jim by singing and dancing and laughing, their happiness bringing him back from the edge of death.\n\n==Characters==\n;William \"Will\" Halloway\n:Born one minute before midnight on October 30, Will is described as having done \"only six years of staring.\" (He is described as having white-blonde hair with eyes \"as clear as summer rain\".) Will is naturally obedient and wary of getting involved in difficult situations; nonetheless, he takes on an active role in fighting the carnival's evil power.\n;James \"Jim\" Nightshade\n:Born one minute after midnight on October 31, Jim is brooding and brash, acting as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] for Will's cautiousness and practicality. (He is described as having wild and tangled chestnut brown hair and eyes the color of \"green-glass fire.\") Jim yearns to become older, which makes him vulnerable to the carnival's temptations, but he is ultimately saved by his friendship with Will.\n;Charles Halloway\n:A middle-aged man who starts out in the novel as quiet and unhappy. He's not very close to his son, but eventually gains self-awareness and faith while up against the carnival (defeating the \"Dust Witch\" and \"Jed/Mr. Dark\").  He becomes a fighter in his own right by the end of the novel, along with gaining the admiration, love, and friendship of his son.\n;G. M. Dark\n:The main antagonist, he is a sinister man who bears tattoos all over his body, one for each person successfully tempted into joining the carnival. Mr. Dark initially holds sway over the other main characters, but his power weakens when Charles uses positive emotions against him, something he cannot comprehend or withstand. Dark's background is a mystery, although when asked if he reads the Bible, he replies, \"I've had every page, line and word read at me, sir!\" This could refer to a possible Christian upbringing, or his victims quoting.  \n;J. C. Cooger\n:Dark's partner in running the carnival, Mr. Cooger, is a fierce, red-headed man who is first seen repairing the carousel. He catches and terrifies Will and Jim until Mr. Dark intervenes. In the guise of her twelve-year-old nephew, he is able to persuade Miss Foley to come to the carnival. The tables are turned on him, however, when Will increases the speed of the carousel as Mr. Cooger is riding it, causing him to rapidly age to the point of decrepitude.  At the climax of the book he crumbles into dust and dies when the freaks accidentally drop him while carrying him back to the carousel. Like Mr. Dark, his origins are unknown.\n;The Dust Witch\n:A blind soothsayer possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]] and the ability to perform many feats of magic, the Witch is portrayed as one of the carnival's most dangerous members. However, her increased sensitivity to the presence and emotions of other people makes her vulnerable to positive feelings. Charles uses this weakness to kill her with a bullet carved with a smile.  Her origins are unknown, but she is illustrated on Mr. Dark's wrist as a \"black-nun blind woman\". \n;Miss Foley\n:A fifty-year-old schoolteacher of Will and Jim. Much like the other victims of the carnival, Miss Foley wished to become young. Her wish is granted, although she is transformed into a little girl with all her memories intact, unable to return to her former life and with no one to take care of her. It is not stated in the novel what happened to Miss Foley at the end.\n;The Skeleton\n:An extremely thin, skeleton-like creature who is one of the more frequently appearing freaks. Like all of the other freaks, he once desired to be younger and was eventually tricked into joining the carnival. The Skeleton appears to be one of the more loyal freaks as, near the book's end, he takes the time to carry the recently deceased and young Mr. Dark with him after all the other freaks ran away. He is last seen walking away into the hills that border the town.\n;Tom Fury/Dwarf\n:A lightning rod salesman who, succumbing to his desire to see the Most Beautiful Woman in the World, is turned into an insane dwarf by the carnival and is recruited into it, with no memories of his former life.\n\n==Themes==\n\n\n\n\n===Structure of the novel===\n''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' can be interpreted as an [[allegory]] of the struggle between [[good and evil]], with the human characters Will, Jim, and Charles on the side of morality and Mr. Dark and his carnival on the side of sin and [[temptation]]. As in many other fictional works revolving around the same concept, good prevails in the end, not with supernatural or physical powers, but with purity of heart. Jim represents good that is always on the verge of giving into temptation, while Will, though he has crises and doubts, is the part of human nature that resists giving in.\n\nAs in ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', Bradbury infuses the novel with [[nostalgia]] for his childhood. However, ''Dandelion Wine'' embodies the idyllic memories of youth, whereas ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' superimposes folk-tale and supernatural elements over a small-town Americana setting in order to explore the dark undercurrents that surround the transition to adulthood.<ref>Attebery, Brian (1980). ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature: From Irving to Le Guin''. Indiana University Press, pp. 136-140.</ref>\n\n===Transition from childhood to adulthood===\nThe carnival's main allure to its participants is its ability to change age easily against natural causes. Jim wants to become an adult by riding the carousel forward while Charles Halloway initially considers riding the carousel backwards. Even Will is somewhat tempted by the offer for a free trip to adulthood.\n\nCharles, however, quickly sees that a ride on the carousel can have unforeseen consequences, because despite age being changed instantly, the carousel would not change the mind of its riders. \n\"If I made you twenty-five tomorrow, Jim, your thoughts would still be boy thoughts, and it'd show! Or if they turned ''me'' into a boy of ten this instant, my brain would still be fifty and that boy would act funnier and older and weirder than any boy ever.\"<ref>{{cite book| first = Ray| last = Bradbury| title = Something Wicked This Way Comes| location = | publisher = Avon| year = 1998| pages = | isbn = 0-380-72940-7| url = https://archive.org/details/somethingwickedt00brad_0}}</ref>\n\nBecause of this effect, a person who rode the carousel would be reformed only physically, with the same sins and emotions contained inside. Moreover, a carousel rider's new physical form, created unnaturally, would alienate them from his or her family and peers, leaving the person with nowhere to turn for acceptance except for the carnival itself.\n\nCharles best personifies this theme; while he is middle-aged in body, he is still youthful in mind and spirit. At first, he sees the two conflicting personas within him as irreconcilable and longs to be physically young too, but his active participation in toppling the carnival proves to him that mental fitness and perception of one's age is more important than physical health.\n\nWill and Jim can be said to have aged prematurely in the novel; the horrors of the carnival force them to grow up fast to be able to deal with its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim do take a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow up slightly. In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables them to grow more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.\n\n===Belief and fear===\nThe novel also conveys the theme that the power of people, objects, and ideas have over you depends on the power you instill in them with your own mind. Because of this, the carnival is able to easily take advantage of the common human fears of aging, death, and loneliness which everyone has or relates to.<ref>Kailua, Dylan S. [http://teenink.com/Past/2006/May/20241.html \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" Book Review]. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\nCharles Halloway is the character who learns the most about this; he initially views death as unpleasant and it thus becomes a sinister force to him that the Mirror Maze magnifies. However, Will's words of love help him to see that age does not matter if one focuses instead on the knowledge and affections gained with it, and as his fear vanishes, so does the Mirror Maze. He also is able to defeat the Dust Witch once he realizes that she does not have ultimate control over him. With his belief in her powers gone, he turns the tables on the Witch by instilling the same fear in her of his smile that he used to have of her magic.\n\n===Viewpoint on life===\nSelf-centered desires and wishes are portrayed as the base of human malice and unhappiness because they blind people to the blessings of life with an unattainable dream. The novel's main example of this is Miss Foley's seduction by Cooger's promise of youth that causes her to fail to see his deception as her \"nephew,\" and lose her rightful place in society.<ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/somethingwicked/essay1.html The Perils of Adulthood in 'Something Wicked This Way Comes']. Retrieved on January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\nIt is implied that the counter-force against this is acceptance of one's faults and an enthusiastic pursuit of the everyday joys of life, signified by Charles' spontaneous running with Jim and Will at the end of the novel. The fact that he is nearly forty years older than them pales in comparison to the pleasure he gains from simple human companionship.<ref>Reid, Robin Anne (2000).
