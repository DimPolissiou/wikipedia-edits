The structure was erected during a period when many skyscrapers were being erected in Lower Manhattan. 48 Wall Street is designed with a multitude of neo-Georgian details. The lowest three stories, built over a raised [[basement]], were used as the banking floor and feature large arched windows on the second story, as well as [[Pediment|pediments]] over the entrances. The top of the building contains a [[cupola]], designed in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style and topped by a statue of an eagle.  \n\nIn 2007, its former banking hall was modified to house the [[Museum of American Finance]], which closed in 2018 and was replaced by Will & Wall, a multi-purpose event venue.

He had several run-ins with the law but was able to avoid conviction for any major offenses until 2004. In 1981, Rizzuto participated in the killing of three rival capos in New York City ordered by [[Joe Massino]] of the [[Bonanno crime family]], and he was indicted by a Brooklyn federal grand jury in connection with these killings in 2004. He was extradited to the United States in 2006, and pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and racketeering charges in 2007. He was given a 10-year prison sentence, but was released in late 2012. The Rizzuto crime family was in the midst of a power struggle while Rizzuto was jailed; his son Nicolo Jr. was killed in 2009, and his father was killed in 2010.
