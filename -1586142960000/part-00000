It also serves as the administrative center of the [[Kryvyi Rih Raion|district]], although it is not part of it. \n\nLocated at the confluence of the [[Saksahan]] and [[Inhulets river|Inhulets]] rivers, Kryvyi Rih has been a major settlement for most of its history. It was founded as a postal city in 1775 by the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]]. Developed as a [[military settlement]] until 1860, it formed part of [[Kherson Governorate]]. It was incorporated during the 20th century with areas of [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate|Yekaterinoslav]]. The [[township]] began to expand \"at an astonishing rate\" at the beginning of the 1880s. Kryvyi Rih's [[urbanization]] was unplanned and stimulated by mining exploitation. [[France|French]] and [[UK|English]] [[investment]] contributed to a boom in [[metallurgy]], [[iron mining]], and investigation of [[Kryvbas|rich deposits of iron ore]]. The [[Yekateryninska Railway]] was built in 1884 to transport iron ore to the [[Donbas]]. This catalyzed the growth of Kryvyi Rih into a major industrial town; it gained [[city]] status in 1919.\n\n[[Nationalization]] and investment spurred by [[1917 Revolution|Soviet authorities]] led to extensive growth. In 1934 [[Kryvorizhstal]] was built, the first of more than 500 factories. [[Kryvyi Rih National University]] was founded here. Financially, the city's postwar growth after the [[Second World War|Nazi]] occupation increased after 1965 due to [[1965 Soviet economic reform|economic reforms]]. Also, investment spurred by [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian Independence]], institution of a [[market economy]] led to extensive regeneration, particularly in the city centre.\n\n{{As of | 2016}} Kryvyi Rih is arguably the main [[steel industry|steel-industry]] city of [[Eastern Europe]]. It is a large, globally important centre of the [[iron-ore]] [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] region, known as the [[Kryvbas]]. The economy of the [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblast]] is the second-largest in Ukraine (after [[Kiev]]).<ref>\n[https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/gosstat-obnarodoval-dannye-dole-regionov-1553868313.html]\n</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe city was founded in the 18th century by [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. Kryvyi Rih in Ukrainian literally means \"Crooked [[Horn (anatomy)|Horn]]\" or \"Curved Bend\". According to local [[legend]], the city was founded by a \"crooked\" ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] slang for one-eyed) Cossack named ''Rih''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kryvyirih.dp.ua/ru/st/pg/241109205040551_s/ |title=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0412.\u041e.

It also serves as the administrative center of the [[Kryvyi Rih Raion|district]], although it is not part of it. \n\nLocated at the confluence of the [[Saksahan]] and [[Inhulets river|Inhulets]] rivers, Kryvyi Rih has been a major settlement for most of its history. It was founded as a postal city in 1775 by the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]]. Developed as a [[military settlement]] until 1860, it formed part of [[Kherson Governorate]]. It was incorporated during the 20th century with areas of [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate|Yekaterinoslav]]. The [[township]] began to expand \"at an astonishing rate\" at the beginning of the 1880s. Kryvyi Rih's [[urbanization]] was unplanned and stimulated by mining exploitation. [[France|French]] and [[UK|English]] [[investment]] contributed to a boom in [[metallurgy]], [[iron mining]], and investigation of [[Kryvbas|rich deposits of iron ore]]. The [[Yekateryninska Railway]] was built in 1884 to transport iron ore to the [[Donbas]]. This catalyzed the growth of Kryvyi Rih into a major industrial town; it gained [[city]] status in 1919.\n\n[[Nationalization]] and investment spurred by [[1917 Revolution|Soviet authorities]] led to extensive growth. In 1934 [[Kryvorizhstal]] was built, the first of more than 500 factories. [[Kryvyi Rih National University]] was founded here. Financially, the city's postwar growth after the [[Second World War|Nazi]] occupation increased after 1965 due to [[1965 Soviet economic reform|economic reforms]]. Also, investment spurred by [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian Independence]], institution of a [[market economy]] led to extensive regeneration, particularly in the city centre.\n\n{{As of | 2016}} Kryvyi Rih is arguably the main [[steel industry|steel-industry]] city of [[Eastern Europe]]. It is a large, globally important centre of the [[iron-ore]] [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] region, known as the [[Kryvbas]]. The economy of the [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblast]] is the second-largest in Ukraine (after [[Kiev]]).<ref>\n[https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/gosstat-obnarodoval-dannye-dole-regionov-1553868313.html]\n</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe city was founded in the 18th century by [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. Kryvyi Rih in Ukrainian literally means \"Crooked [[Horn (anatomy)|Horn]]\" or \"Curved Bend\". According to local [[legend]], the city was founded by a \"crooked\" ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] slang for one-eyed) Cossack named ''Rih''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kryvyirih.dp.ua/ru/st/pg/241109205040551_s/ |title=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0412.\u041e.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates).

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence.

In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''. Recently, Lithuanian linguists advocated dropping the usage of this Polish loanword.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupien\u0117 |first=J\u016brat\u0117 |author-link=J\u016brat\u0117 Kiaupien\u0117 |year=2003 |title=\"Mes, Lietuva\": Lietuvos Did\u017eiosios Kunigaik\u0161tyst\u0117s bajorija XVI a. |trans-title=\"We the Lithuania\": nobility of Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 16th c. |language=Lithuanian |publisher=Kronta |isbn=9955-595-08-6 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nThe process of [[polonization]] took place over a lengthy period. At first only the leading members of the nobility were involved. Gradually the wider population became affected.

Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]]. Most often the individual being ennobled would join an existing noble szlachta clan and assume the undifferentiated [[Polish heraldry|coat of arms]] of that clan.\n\nAccording to [[heraldic]] sources, the total number of legal ennoblements issued between the 14th century and the mid-18th century is estimated at approximately 800.<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> This is an average of only about two ennoblements per year, or only 0.000,000,14 \u2013 0.000,001 of the historical population.

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary.

Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

During the [[Partitions of Poland]] from 1772 to 1795, minor szlachta began to lose these legal privileges and social status, while elites became part of the nobility of partitioning countries.\n\nAlthough szlachta members had greatly unequal status due to wealth and political influence, few official distinctions existed between elites and common nobility. Because of the juridic principle of szlachta equality, and a disdain for distinction by way of titles, the relatively few hereditary [[Noble title|titles]] in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs, including personal hereditary titles granted by the [[Papal nobility|Pope]] &mdash; see [[Feliks Soba\u0144ski]]. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia, and Samogitia princely titles were mostly inherited by descendants of Old Lithuanian-Ruthenian [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikid]] and [[Family of Gediminas|Gediminids]] princely families, or by princely dynasties of Tatar origin settled there.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe Polish term ''szlachta'' is derived from the [[Old High German]] word ''slahta''. In modern German ''Geschlecht'' - which originally came from the [[Proto-Germanic]] *''slagiz'', \"blow\", \"strike\", and shares the [[Anglo-Saxon]] root for \"slaughter\" or the verb \"to slug\" \u2013 means \"breeding\" or gender. Like many other Polish words pertaining to nobility, it derives from Germanic words: the Polish for a \"knight\" is \"''rycerz''\", a [[cognate]] of the German \"''Ritter''\". The Polish word for \"coat of arms\" is \"''herb''\" from the German \"''Erbe''\" or \"heritage\".\n17th century Poles assumed \"''szlachta''\" came from the German \"''schlachten''\" \"to slaughter\" or \"to butcher\", and was therefore related to the German word for battle, \"''Schlacht''\". Some early Polish historians thought the term might have derived from the name of the legendary proto-Polish chief, [[Lech, Czech and Rus|Lech]], mentioned in Polish and Czech writings. In [[Gaels|Gaelic]] society, large landholders with hereditary tenures formed the principal lineages of their own \"clans\" or \"[[sept]]s,\" and they were traced to a ''[[Sept|sliocht]]'', or branch, of the ruling families.<ref>{{cite journal\n| last = McInerney\n| first = Luke\n| date = 2018\n| title = A List of Freeholders of Kilfenora Diocese in 1601\n| jstor = 26605109\n| journal = Eolas: The Journal of the American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| location = [[Maple Grove, Minnesota|Maple Grove]], [[Hennepin County|Hennepin county]], [[Minnesota|MINNESOTA]], U.S.A.\n| publisher = American Society of Irish Medieval Studies\n| volume = 11\n| pages = 60\u2013103\n| quote = This stratum of landholders were usually large freeholders with hereditary tenures.

The Polish tribes were internalized and organized around a unifying religious cult, governed by the ''[[Veche|wiec]]'', an assembly of free tribesmen. Later, when safety required power to be consolidated, an elected prince was chosen to govern. The election privilege was usually limited to elites.<ref name=\"bardach202627\" />\n\nThe tribes were ruled by clans ([[:pl:R\u00f3d|''r\u00f3d'']]) consisting of people related by blood or marriage and theoretically descending from a common ancestor,<ref name=\"radwan-family-line\" /> giving the r\u00f3d/clan a highly developed sense of solidarity. (See ''[[gens]]''.) The ''[[starosta]]'' (or ''starszyna'') had judicial and military power over the r\u00f3d/clan, although this power was often exercised with an assembly of elders. Strongholds called ''[[Gord (Slavic settlement)|gr\u03ccd]]'' were built where the religious cult was powerful, where trials were conducted, and where clans gathered in the face of danger. The ''opole'' was the territory occupied by a single tribe. {{Harv|Manteuffel|1982|p=44}} The family unit of a tribe is called the ''rodzina'', while a collection of tribes is a [[:pl:Plemi\u0119|''plemi\u0119'']].\n\n[[Mieszko I of Poland]] (c. 935 \u2013 25 May 992) established an elite knightly retinue from within his army, which he depended upon for success in uniting the [[Lechites|Lekhitic]] tribes and preserving the unity of his state. Documented proof exists of Mieszko I's successors utilizing such a retinue, as well.\n\nAnother class of knights were granted land by the prince, allowing them the economic ability to serve the prince militarily. A Polish nobleman living at the time prior to the 15th century was referred to as a \"rycerz\", very roughly equivalent to the English \"knight,\" the critical difference being the status of \"rycerz\" was almost strictly hereditary;<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" /><ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> the class of all such individuals was known as the \"rycerstwo\".<ref name=\"topor-jakubowski--1998\" /> Representing the wealthier families of Poland and itinerant knights from abroad seeking their fortunes, this other class of rycerstwo, which became the szlachta/nobility (\"szlachta\" becomes the proper term for Polish nobility beginning about the 15th century), gradually formed apart from Mieszko I's and his successors' elite retinues. This rycerstwo/nobility obtained more privileges granting them favored status. They were absolved from particular burdens and obligations under ducal law, resulting in the belief only rycerstwo (those combining military prowess with high/noble birth) could serve as officials in state administration.\n\nSelect rycerstwo were distinguished above the other rycerstwo, because they descended from past tribal dynasties, or because early [[Piast dynasty|Piasts']] endowments made them select beneficiaries. These rycerstwo of great wealth were called mo\u017cni (Magnates).

The prior social structure was one of Polish tribes united into the historic Polish nation under a state ruled by the [[Piast dynasty]], this dynasty appearing circa 850 A.D.\n\nSome mo\u017cni (Magnates) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of Piast realms, even though the Piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence.

In Lithuanian, nobles were named ''ponai''. The higher nobility were named ''kunigai'' or ''kunigaik\u0161\u010diai'' (dukes) \u2014 a loanword from Scandinavian ''[[konung]]''. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state, they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the [[King of Lithuania]]. Because of Lithuanian expansion into the lands of [[Ruthenia]] in the middle of the 14th century, a new term for nobility appeared \u2014 ''bajorai'', from [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] ''\u0431\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0435''. This word is used to this day in Lithuania to refer to nobility in general, including those from abroad.\n\nAfter the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], the Lithuanian nobility acquired equal status with its Polish counterparts. Over time they became increasingly [[polonized]], although they did preserve their [[nation]]al consciousness, and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots. In the 16th century, some of the Lithuanian nobility claimed that they were descended from the Romans, and that the [[Lithuanian language]] was derived from Latin. This led to a conundrum: Polish nobility claimed its own ancestry from [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribes, but Sarmatians were considered enemies of the Romans. Thus, a new Roman-Sarmatian theory was created. Strong cultural ties with Polish nobility led to a new term for Lithuanian nobility appearing in the 16th century \u2014 ''\u0161l\u0117kta'', a direct loanword from Polish ''szlachta''.

Many noble Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanians.\n\nThe rights of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nobles were nominally equal to those enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility, but they were put under cultural pressure to convert to Catholicism. It was a policy that was greatly eased in 1596 by the [[Union of Brest]].

Initially, this privilege could be granted by the monarch, but from 1641 onward, this right was reserved for the [[sejm]].

This can most readily be explained in terms of the ongoing decline and eventual collapse of the Commonwealth and the resulting need for soldiers and other military leaders (see: [[Partitions of Poland]], King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]]).\n\n==== Estimated number of ennoblements ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Count [[Stanis\u0142aw Szcz\u0119sny Potocki]] with children'', by [[Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder]].]]\nAccording to [[heraldic]]<ref name=\"czajkowski\" /><ref name=\"pudlowski\" /> sources 1,600 is the total estimated number of all legal ennoblements throughout the history of Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the 14th century onward (half of which were performed in the final years of the late 18th century).\n\nTypes of ennoblement:\n* [[Adopcja herbowa]] \u2013 The \"old way\" of ennoblement, popular in the 15th century, connected with adoption into an existing noble clan by a powerful lord, but abolished in the 17th century.\n* [[Skartabellat]] \u2013 Introduced by [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|pacta conventa]] of the 17th century, this was ennoblement into a sort of \"conditional\" or \"graduated nobility\" status. Skartabels could not hold public offices or be members of the Sejm, but after three generations, the descendants of these families would \"mature\" to full szlachta status.\n* [[Indygenat]] \u2013 from the Latin expression, ''indigenatus'', recognition of foreign noble status. A foreign noble, after acquiring indygenat status, received all privileges of a Polish szlachcic. In Polish history, 413 foreign noble families were recognized. Prior to the 17th century this was done by the King and [[Sejm]], after the 17th century it was done only by the Sejm.\n* \"secret ennoblement\" \u2013 This was of questionable legal status and was often not recognized by many szlachta members. It was typically granted by the elected monarch without the required legal approval of the Sejm.\n\n=== In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===\nIn the late 14th century, in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vytautas the Great]] reformed the Grand Duchy's army: instead of calling all men to arms, he created forces comprising professional warriors\u2014''[[bajorai]]'' (\"nobles\"; see the [[cognate]] \"''[[boyar]]''\"). As there were not enough nobles, Vytautas trained suitable men, relieving them of labor on the land and of other duties; for their [[military service]] to the Grand Duke, they were granted land that was worked by hired men ([[veldamas|veldam]]s). The newly formed noble families generally took up, as their [[family name]]s, the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] pagan [[given name]]s of their ennobled ancestors; this was the case with the [[Go\u0161tautai]], [[Radvilos]], [[Astikai]], [[K\u0119sgailos]] and others. These families were granted their [[coats of arms]] under the [[Union of Horodlo]] (1413).\n\nIn 1506, King [[Sigismund I the Old]] confirmed the position of the [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]] in state politics and limited entry into the [[nobility]].\n\n== Privileges ==\n{{main|Szlachta's privileges}}\n\nSpecific rights of the szlachta included:\n[[File:Bellotto Election of Stanislas Augustus.jpg|thumb|Election of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] in 1764]]\n# The right to hold outright ownership of land ([[Allod]]) -- not as a fief, conditional upon service to the liege Lord, but absolutely in perpetuity unless sold.

Sketch by [[Jan Matejko]], 1860]]\nSignificant legislative changes in the status of the szlachta, as defined by Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, consist of its 1374 exemption from the land tax, a 1425 guarantee against the 'arbitrary arrests and/or seizure of property' of its members, a 1454 requirement that military forces and new taxes be approved by provincial [[Sejm]]s, and statutes issued between 1496 and 1611 that prescribed the rights of commoners.<ref name=\"ian\" />\n\n=== Real and false nobles ===\nNobles were born into a [[noble family]], adopted by a noble family (this was abolished in 1633), or achieved noble rank through [[Ennoblement]] by a king or [[Sejm]] for reasons such as bravery in combat, services to the state, etc. Yet this proved to be the rarest means of gaining noble status. Many nobles were, in fact, usurpers who were commoners that had moved to another part of the country and falsely claimed noble status.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Hundreds of such \"false nobles\" were denounced by Hieronim Nekanda Trepka in his ''\"Liber generationis plebeanorum\"'', or ''\"Liber chamorum\"'', in the first half of the 16th century. The law forbade non-nobles to own ''folwarks'' and promised such estates as a reward to denouncers. Trepka was himself an impoverished nobleman who lived a town dweller's life and documented hundreds of such false claims hoping to take over one of the usurped estates. He does not seem to have succeeded in his quest despite his employment as the king's secretary.<ref>Leszczy\u0144ski, R.

It is unknown what percentage of the Polish nobility came from the 'lower orders' of society, but most historians agree nobles of such base origins formed a 'significant' element of the szlachta. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nSelf-promotion and aggrandizement were not confined to commoners. Often, members of the lower szlachta sought further ennoblement from foreign, therefore less verifiable, sources. That is, they might acquire by legitimate means or otherwise, such as by purchase, one of a selection of foreign titles ranging from [[Baron]], [[Marchese]], [[Freiherr]] to [[Count|Comte]], all readily translatable into the Polish ''[[Hrabia]]''. Alternatively, they would simply appropriate a title by conferring it upon themselves. An example of this is cited in the case of the last descendant of the [[Andrzej Ciechanowiecki|Ciechanowiecki family]], who managed to restore a genuinely old [[Comital]] title, but whose actual origins are shrouded in 18th-century mystery.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Andrzej Rachuba, \"Panowie z Ciechanowa\"|title= Kronika Zamkowa 1-2/59-60|page=33|date = 2010|url=http://mazowsze.hist.pl/16/Kronika_Zamkowa/356/2010/12307/ }} In Polish with an English summary. The author shows it is likely a Ciechanowiecki ancestor either received a fashionable noble title in exchange for money while travelling on ''the Grand Tour'' in Western Europe or, simply \"conferred it upon himself\" to hark back to a former higher status. [retrieved 2018.11.30.]</ref>\n\n=== Accretion of sovereignty to the szlachta ===\nPolish nobility enjoyed many rights that were not available to their equivalents in other countries. Over time, each new monarch ceded to them further privileges. Those privileges became the basis of the ''[[Golden Liberty]]'' in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Despite having a king, Poland was considered the 'nobility's [[Rzeczpospolita|Commonwealth]]' because [[Royal elections in Poland]] were in the hands of members of a hereditary class. Poland was therefore the domain of this class, and not that of the king or the ruling [[dynasty]]. This arose in part because of the extinction of male heirs in the original royal dynasties: first, the [[Piasts]], then the [[Jagiellons]]. As a result, the nobility took it upon itself to choose \"the Polish king\" from among the dynasties' [[Matrilineality|matrilinial]] descendants.\n\nPoland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility upon their election to the throne - the privileges having been specified in the king-elect's [[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]] - and at other times, in exchange for ''[[ad hoc]]'' leave to raise an extraordinary tax or a ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]'', a military call up. Poland's nobility thus accumulated a growing array of privileges and immunities.\n\nIn 1355 in [[Buda]] King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III the Great]]<!--or Louis the Hungarian? sources vary! needs verification!--> issued the first country-wide privilege for the nobility, in exchange for their agreeing that if Casimir had no male heirs, the throne would pass to his nephew, [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Casimir further decreed that the nobility would no longer be subject to 'extraordinary' taxes or have to use their own funds for foreign military expeditions. Casimir also promised that when the royal court toured, the king and the court would cover all expenses, instead of requiring facilities to be provided by the local nobility.\n\n==== The Privilege of Koszyce and others ====\nIn 1374 [[Louis I of Hungary|King Louis of Hungary]] approved the [[Privilege of Koszyce]] (''przywilej koszycki'') to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]]. He broadened the definition of membership of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (''\u0142anowy'') a limit of 2 [[grosz]]es per ''\u0142an'' of land, [[Old Polish units of measurement]]. In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was effectively abolished: no new taxes would be levied without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#District offices|district offices]] were also reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, the privilege obliged the king to pay [[indemnity|indemnities]] to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders.\n\nIn 1422 [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] was constrained by the Privilege of Czerwi\u0144sk (''przywilej czerwi\u0144ski''), which established the inviolability of nobles' property. Their estates could not be confiscated except upon the verdict of a court. It also made him cede some jurisdiction over [[fiscal policy]] to the [[Privy council|Royal Council]], later, the [[Senate of Poland]], including the right to [[mint (coin)|mint coinage]].\n\nIn 1430, with the Privileges of [[Jedlnia]], confirmed at [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1433, Polish: ''przywileje jedlne\u0144sko-krakowskie'', based partially on his earlier [[Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski]] privilege (April 25, 1425), King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest, similar to the English [[Magna Carta]]'s [[habeas corpus]], known from its own Latin name as \"[[neminem captivabimus]] nisi jure victum\". Henceforth, no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] from a court of justice. The king could neither punish nor imprison any noble on a whim. King W\u0142adys\u0142aw's ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for the [[easement]] was the nobles' guarantee that the throne would be inherited by one of his sons, who would be bound to honour the privileges granted earlier to the nobility. On May 2, 1447 the same king issued the ''[[Wilno Pact]], or Wilno Privilege'', which gave the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanian]] [[boyar]]s the same rights as those already secured by the Polish ''szlachta''.\n[[File:Rembrandt. A Polish Nobleman. 1637.PNG|right|thumb|upright|''[[A Polish Nobleman]]''. [[Rembrandt]], 1637]]\n\nIn 1454, [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|King Casimir IV]] granted the [[Nieszawa Statutes]] - Polish: ''statuty cerkwicko-nieszawskie'', clarifying the legal basis of [[voivodship]] [[sejmik]]s - local parliaments. The king could [[promulgation|promulgate]] new laws, raise taxes, or call for a mass military call up ''pospolite ruszenie'', only with the consent of the sejmiks, and the nobility were protected from judicial abuses. The Nieszawa Statutes also curbed the power of the magnates, as the Sejm, the national parliament, had the right to elect many officials, including judges, [[Voivode|voivods]] and [[castellan]]s. These privileges were demanded by the ''szlachta'' in exchange for their participation in the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]].\n\n==== First Royal Election ====\nThe first \"[[Royal elections in Poland|free election]]\" (Polish: ''wolna elekcja'') of a king took place in 1492. In fact, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from assemblies such as those that put [[Casimir II of Poland|Casimir II]] on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections. Only [[senator]]s voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by [[John I Albert]]. For the duration of the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], only members of that royal family were considered for election. Later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nIn 1493 the Sejm, began meeting every two years at [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]]. It comprised two chambers:\n* a [[Senat]]e of 81 [[bishop]]s and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]] \n* a Chamber of Deputies of 54 deputies representing their respective domains.\nThe numbers of senators and deputies later increased.\n\nOn April 26, 1496 King [[John I Albert]] granted the [[Privilege of Piotrk\u00f3w]]. The [[Statutes of Piotrk\u00f3w]] increased the nobility's [[feudal]] power over [[serfs]]. It bound the peasant to the land, and only one son though not the eldest, was permitted to leave the village. Townsfolk ''mieszcza\u0144stwo'' were prohibited from owning land. Positions in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] hierarchy were restricted to nobles.\n\nOn 23 October 1501, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union]] was reformed by the [[Union of Mielnik]]. It was there that the tradition of a [[coronation Sejm]] was founded. Here again, the lesser nobility, lesser in wealth only - not in rank - attempted to reduce the power of the Magnates with a law that made them [[impeachment|impeachable]] before the Senate for [[malfeasance]]. However, the [[Act of Mielnik]] of 25 October did more to strengthen the Magnate-dominated [[Senate of Poland]] than the lesser nobility. Nobles as a whole were given the right to disobey the King or his representatives \u2014 ''non praestanda oboedientia'', and to form [[konfederacja|confederations]], armed opposition against the king or state officials if the nobles found that the law or their legitimate privileges were being infringed.\n[[File:Pot\u0119ga Rzeczypospolitej u zenitu. Z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107. Elekcja R.P. 1573.jpg|thumb|right|''The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith, [[Golden Liberty]], the [[Royal elections in Poland|Election]] of 1573''. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n\nOn 3 May 1505 King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]] granted the Act of ''[[Nihil novi]] nisi commune consensu'' - \"I accept nothing new except by common consent\". This forbade the king to pass new laws without the consent of the representatives of the nobility in the assembled Sejm, thus greatly strengthening the nobility's powers. Essentially, this act marked the transfer of legislative power from the king to the Sejm. It also marks the beginning of the [[First Rzeczpospolita]], the period of a ''szlachta''-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nIn 1520 the Act of Bydgoszcz granted the Sejm the right to convene every four years, with or without the king's permission. At about that time the ''Executionist Movement'', seeking to oversee law enforcement, began to take shape. Its members sought to curb the power of the Magnates at the Sejm and to strengthen the power of the monarch. In 1562 at the Sejm in Piotrk\u00f3w they forced the Magnates to return many leased [[Krolewszczyzna|crown lands]] to the king, and the king to create a standing army [[wojsko kwarciane]]. One of the most famous members of this movement was [[Jan Zamoyski]].\n\n==== End of the Jagiellonian dynasty ====\n[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]], first elected monarch of Poland-Lithuania]]\nUntil the death of [[Sigismund II Augustus]], the last king of the [[Jagiellonian]] dynasty, all monarchs had to be elected from within the royal family. However, from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could potentially become a [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish\u2013Lithuanian]] monarch. Every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents: the ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'', the king's \"pre-election pact\", and the ''[[Henrican articles]]'', named after the first freely elected king, [[Henry III of France|Henry of Valois]]. The latter document was a virtual ''Polish constitution'' and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:\n* Free election of kings\n* [[Religious freedom in Poland|Religious tolerance]]\n* The Sejm to meet every two years\n* Foreign policy controlled by the Sejm\n* A royal advisory council chosen by the Sejm\n* Official posts restricted to Polish and Lithuanian nobles\n* Taxes and monopolies set up by the Sejm only\n* Nobles' right to disobey the Monarch should s/he break any of these laws.\n\nIn 1578 king, [[Stefan Batory]], created the [[Crown Tribunal]] to reduce the enormous pressure on the [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]]. This placed much of the monarch's juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility as a class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the [[Lithuanian Tribunal]].\n\n=== Transformation into aristocracy ===\n[[File:Posiadlosci magnaterii w XVI-XVII w.svg|thumb|right|[[Ownership|Possession]]s of major magnate families in 16th\u201317th century.]]\n{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}\nFor many centuries, wealthy and powerful members of the szlachta sought to gain legal privileges over their peers. Few szlachta were wealthy enough to be known as Magnates, ''karmazyni'', the \"[[Crimson]]s\" - from the crimson colour of their boots. A true Magnate had to be able to trace his ancestry for many generations and own at least 20 villages or estates. He also had to hold high [[offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|office in the Commonwealth]].\n\n{{Citation needed|Some historians estimate the number of Magnates as 1% of the szlachta's total|date=November 2018}}. Thus, out of about one million szlachta, only 200\u2013300 persons could be classed as great Magnates with country-wide possessions and influence. Of these some 30\u201340 were considered as having significant impact on Poland's politics. Magnates often received gifts from monarchs, which greatly increased their wealth. Although such gifts were only temporary [[lease]]s, often the Magnates never returned them. This gave rise in the 16th century, to a self-policing trend by the szlachta, known as the ''ruch egzekucji praw'' \u2014 movement for the enforcement of the law - against usurping Magnates to force them to return leased lands back to their rightful owner, the monarch.\n\nOne of the most important victories of the Magnates was the late 16th century right to create ''[[Ordynacja]]s'', similar to [[Fee tail]]s under English law, which ensured that a family which gained landed wealth could more easily preserve it. The ''Ordynacjas'' that belonged to families such as the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Zamoyski]], [[Potocki]] or [[Lubomirski]]s often rivalled the estates of the king and were important power bases for them.\n\nVery high offices of the Polish crown were [[de facto]] \"hereditary\" and guarded by the [[magnate]]ria of Poland, leaving the lower offices below for \"middling\" nobility ([[Baron|\"'''the baronage'''\"]] -- '''SEE:''' '''[[Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]''' for a sense of the hierarchy). The prestige of lower offices depended on the wealth of the region. The [[Masovia]] region of Poland had a long-standing reputation of being rather poor due to the condition of the soil.\n\nThe difference between the ''magnateria'' and the rest of the szlachta was primarily one of wealth and life-style, as both belonged to the same legally defined class being members of the same clans. Consequently, any power wrested from the king by the magnates was consequently trickled down to the entirety of the szlachta. This often meant the rest of the szlachta tended to cooperate with the magnates rather than struggle against them.<ref name=\"dmowski-magnates-szlachta\" />\n\n=== The szlachta's loss of influence ===\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|right|[[Galician slaughter|The Peasant Uprising of 1846]], the largest [[peasant uprising]] against ''szlachta'' rulership on Polish lands in the 19th century.]]The notion of the szlachta's accrued sovereignty ended in 1795 with the final [[Partitions of Poland]], and until 1918 their legal status was dependent on the policies of the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] or the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

All land taken from Polish peasants since 1846 was to be returned to them without redemption payments. The ex-serfs could only sell land to other peasants, not szlachta. 90% of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 lived in the 8 western provinces. Along with [[Romania]], Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only ones to be given land after serfdom was abolished.<ref>The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe, Jerome Blum, page 391.</ref> All this was to punish the szlachta's role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863.\nBy 1864 80% of szlachta were ''d\u00e9class\u00e9'' - downward social mobility.

During the Age of Enlightenment, King Stanislaw August Poniatowski emulated the French [[Salon (gathering)|Salons]] by holding his famed [[Thursday Lunches]] for intellectuals and artists, drawn chiefly from the szlachta.<ref>Michniewski, A. \" \u201eDo czwartku\u201d, Zabawy Przyjemne i Po\u017cyteczne 1772\", v. 12, p. 1.

It was equivalent to a [[harvest festival]].

With the introduction of rulers and rules, big game, generically ''zwierzyna'': [[Aurochs]], [[European bison|bison]], deer and boar became the preserve of kings and princes on penalty of [[Poaching|poacher]]s' death. From the 13th century on the king would appoint a high-ranking courtier to the role of Master of the Hunt, ''[[\u0141owczy]]''. In time, the penalties for poaching were commuted to fines and from around the 14th century, landowners acquired the right to hunt on their land. Small game, foxes, hare, badger and stoat etc. were 'fair game' to all comers. Hunting became one of the most popular social activities of the szlachta until the partitions, when different sets of restrictions in the three territories were introduced. This was with a view to curbing social interaction among the subject Poles.<ref>Cheda, Jacek. (2010) \u0141owiectwo i jego rola w \u017cyciu spo\u0142ecznym Wielkiej Brytanii i Polski.

One was the [[Polish Hunting Dog]], the ''brach''. The other was the [[Ogar Polski]].

The most important difference was that, while in most European countries the nobility lost power as the ruler strove for [[absolute monarchy]], in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a reverse process occurred: the nobility actually gained power at the expense of the king, and enabled the [[political system]] to evolve into an [[oligarchy]].\n\nSzlachta members were also proportionately more numerous than their equivalents in all other European countries, constituting 6\u201312% of the entire population.<ref name=\"Frost\" />{{Ref label|a|a|none}} By contrast, nobles in other European countries, except for Spain, amounted to a mere 1\u20133%.

Their privileges became increasingly limited, and were ultimately dissolved by the [[March Constitution (Poland)|March Constitution of Poland]] in 1921.\n\nThere were a number of avenues to upward social mobility and the attainment of nobility.

But where there has been an intrusion of a dominant people, or settlers, who have not fused into the original population, there we find an exact counterpart of Polish society: the dominant settlers establishing themselves as an upper caste, all politically equal among themselves, and holding the lands (or, more frequently, simply drawing the rents) of the country.<ref name=\"races-old-world\" />{{rp|483}}}}\n\nSociologist and historian, [[Jerzy Szacki|Jerzy Ryszard Szacki]] said in this context,\n\n{{quote|text=... the Polish nobility was a closed group (apart from a few exceptions, many of which were contrary to the law), in which membership was inherited.<ref name=\"szacki--inherited--1995\" />}}\nOthers assert the szlachta were not a [[social class]], but a [[caste]], among them, historian [[Adam Zamoyski]],\n\n{{quote|text=A more apt analogy might perhaps be made with the [[Rajput]]s of northern India. ... unlike any other gentry in Europe, the szlachta was not limited by nor did it depend for its status on either wealth, or land, or royal writ.

A noble woman married to a commoner could not transmit her nobility to her husband and their children. Any individual could attain ennoblement (''{{lang|pl|nobilitacja}}'') for special services to the state. A foreign noble might be naturalized as a Polish noble through the mechanism called the ''[[Indygenat]]'', certified by the king. Later, from 1641, it could only be done by a [[general sejm]]. By the eighteenth century all these trends contributed to the great increase in the proportion of szlachta in the total population.\n\nIn theory all szlachta members were social equals and were formally legal peers. Those who held civic appointments were more privileged but their roles were not hereditary. Those who held honorary appointments were superior in the hierarchy but these positions were only granted for a lifetime. Some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and title. Nobles who were not direct [[Lessee]]s of the Crown but held land from other lords were only peers \"de iure\". The poorest enjoyed the same rights as the wealthiest magnate. The exceptions were a few symbolically privileged families such as the Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Lubomirski and [[Czartoryski]], who held honorary aristocratic titles bestowed by foreign courts and recognised in Poland which granted them use of titles such as \"Prince\" or \"[[Count]]\". See also [[The Princely Houses of Poland]]. All other szlachta simply addressed each other by their given name or as \"Brother, Sir\" ''Panie bracie'' or the feminine equivalent. The other forms of address would be \"Illustrious and Magnificent Lord\", \"Magnificent Lord\", \"Generous Lord\" or \"Noble Lord\" in descending order, or simply \"His/Her Grace Lord/Lady\".\n\nThe notion that all Polish nobles were social equals, regardless of their financial status or offices held, is enshrined in a traditional Polish [[adage]]:\n\n{{poemquote|''Szlachcic na zagrodzie''\n''r\u00f3wny wojewodzie.''}}\nequivalent to:\n{{poemquote|''The noble on the [[croft (land)|croft]] Is the [[voivode]]'s equal.''}}\n\n=== Szlachta hierarchy ===\nAccording to their wealth, the nobility were divided into:\n* [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnates]], the wealthiest class: owners of vast lands, towns, many villages, and thousands of peasants\n[[File:150913_Garden_of_the_Branicki_Palace_in_Bia\u0142ystok_-_02.jpg|thumb|left|702px|Magnate palace: [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki herbu (coat of arms) Gryf family palace]] in [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bia\u0142ystok, Podlaskie province, POLAND.]]]]{{clear}}\n* middle nobility (''\u015brednia szlachta''): owners of one or more villages, often having some official titles, or Envoys from the local Land Assemblies to the General Assembly\n[[File:\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski_z_D\u0105br\u00f3wki_Herbu_(Coat_of_Arms)_Radwan_Family_Manor_in_Micha\u0142owice_Village,_POLAND.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Middle nobility manor house ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]]): [[D\u0105browski Manor in Micha\u0142owice|\u017b\u0105d\u0142o-D\u0105browski z D\u0105br\u00f3wki herbu (coat of arms) Radwan family manor]] in [[Micha\u0142owice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Micha\u0142owice village]], Micha\u0142owice rural administrative district, Krak\u00f3w county, Lesser Poland province, POLAND.]]{{clear}}\n[[File:Gerson Before the manor.jpg|thumb|right|180px|\"In Front of the Manor House\" by [[Wojciech Gerson]]; Year: 1856 - painting of a lesser szlachta/nobility homestead ([[Manor houses of Polish nobility|dw\u00f3r]])]]\n* [[petty nobility]] (''drobna szlachta''): owners of part of a village or owning no land at all, often referred to by a variety of colourful Polish terms such as:\n**''{{ill|szlachta za\u015bciankowa|pl}}'' \u2013 from ''za\u015bcianek'' (backwater/boondocks/the sticks), poorer members of the szlachta settled together in related families in one village, ''neighborhood/village nobility''. \n**''szaraczkowa'' \u2013 ''grey nobility'', from their grey, [[wool]]len, undyed [[\u017cupan]]s\n**''okoliczna'' \u2013 ''local nobility'', similar to ''za\u015bciankowa''\n**''zagrodowa'' \u2013 from ''zagroda'', a farm, often little different from a peasant's dwelling\n**''zagonowa'' \u2013 from ''zagon'', a small unit of land measure, ''hide nobility''\n**''cz\u0105stkowa'' \u2013 ''partial'', owners of only part of a single village\n**''panek'' \u2013 little ''pan'' (i.e., lordling), term used in [[Kashubia|Kaszuby]], the Kashubian region, also one of the legal terms for legally separated lower nobility in late medieval and early modern Poland\n**''hreczkosiej'' \u2013 ''[[buckwheat]] sowers'' <!--more or less--> \u2013 those who had to work their fields themselves because they had no peasants.\n**''brukowa'' \u2013 ''[[cobblestone|cobble]] nobility'', for those living in towns like townsfolk\n**''go\u0142ota'' \u2013 ''naked nobility'', i.e., the landless; the poorest szlachta considered the \"lowest of the high.\" They were later stripped of voting rights.\n**''p\u00f3\u0142panek'' (\"half-lord\"); also podpanek/pidpanek (\"sub-lord\") in [[Podolia]] and Ukrainian accent<ref>[http://ebuw.uw.edu.pl/dlibra/plain-content?id=7352 Lw\u00f3w i Wilno / &#91;publ. by J.

Since titular [[Lord of the manor|manorial lordships]] were also open to burgers of certain privileged cities with a royal charter, not all landed gentry had hereditary title to noble status.{{clear}}\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n{{Main|Polish heraldry}}\n{{Commons category|Coats of arms of families of Poland}}\n[[File:Boles\u0142aw I Wysoki.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]] with a heraldic shield, by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\n[[Coat of arms|Coats of arms]] were very important to the szlachta. Its heraldic system evolved together with neighbouring states in [[Central Europe]], while differing in many ways from the heraldry of other European countries. Polish Knighthood had its counterparts, links and roots in [[Moravia]], e.g. [[Poraj coat of arms]] and in [[Germany]], e.g. [[Junosza coat of arms]].\n\nFamilies who had a common origin would also share a coat of arms. They would also share their crest with families adopted into the clan. Sometimes unrelated families would be falsely attributed to a clan on the basis of similarity of crests. Some noble families inaccurately claimed clan membership. The number of coats of arms in this system was comparatively low and did not exceed 200 in the late Middle Ages. There were 40,000 in the late 18th century.\n\nAt the [[Union of Horod\u0142o]], forty-seven families of Catholic Lithuanian lords and boyars were adopted by Polish szlachta families and allowed to use Polish coats of arms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frost|first1=Robert I.|title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Marian|first1=Biskup|chapter=Polish Diplomacy during the Angewin and Jagiellonian Era (1370-1572): X-XX C|title=The History of Polish Diplomacy: X-XX C|date=2005|publisher=Sejm Publishing Office|page=79}}</ref>\n\n==== Heritability ====\nThe tradition of differentiating between a coat of arms and a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] granted to women, did not develop in Poland. By the 17th century, invariably, men and women inherited a coat of arms from their father. When mixed marriages developed after the partitions, that is between commoners and members of the nobility, as a courtesy, children could claim a coat of arms from their [[distaff]] side, but this was only tolerated and could not be passed on into the next generation. The [[brisure]] was rarely used. All children would inherit the coat of arms and title of their father. This partly accounts for the relatively large proportion of Polish families who had claim to a coat of arms by the 18th century. Another factor was the arrival of titled foreign settlers, especially from the German lands and the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIllegitimate children could adopt the mother's surname and title by the consent of the mother's father, but would sometimes be adopted and raised by the natural father's family, thereby acquiring the father's surname, though not the title or arms.\n\n=== Sarmatism ===\n[[File:Jan Zamoyski.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Hetman]] [[Jan Zamoyski]], as a representative of [[Sarmatism]].]]\nThe ''szlachta''{{'}}s prevalent [[ideology]], especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, was manifested in its adoption of \"[[Sarmatism]]\", a word derived from the [[legend]] that its origins reached back to the ancient tribe of an Iranic people, the [[Sarmatians]]. This nostalgic belief system embracing chivalry and courtliness, became an important part of ''szlachta'' culture and affected all aspects of their lives. It was popularized by poets who exalted traditional village life, peace and pacifism. It was also manifested in oriental-style apparel, the ''[[\u017cupan]]'', ''[[kontusz]]'', ''[[sukmana]]'', ''[[pas kontuszowy]]'', ''[[Delia (clothing)|delia]]'' and made the [[scimitar]]-like ''[[szabla]]'' a near-obligatory item of everyday ''szlachta'' apparel. Sarmatism served to integrate a nobility of disparate provenance, as it sought to create a sense of [[nationalism|national]] unity and pride in the szlachta's \"[[Golden Liberty]]\" ''z\u0142ota wolno\u015b\u0107''. It was marked furthermore by a linguistic affectation among the ''szlachta'' of mixing Polish and Latin vocabulary, producing a form of Polish [[Dog Latin]] peppered with \"[[Macaronic language|macaronism]]s\" in everyday conversation.<ref>Wasko, Andrzej.

[[Jan \u0141aski]] or ''Johannes Alasco'' (1499-1560) was a cleric, whose uncle, the eponymous [[Jan \u0141aski (1456-1531)]] was [[Grand Chancellor of the Crown]], Archbishop of Gniezno and [[Primate of Poland]]. His nephew was an early convert to [[Calvinism]] and had a hand in implementing (c. 1543\u20131555) [[English Reformation|Reformation]] in England where he is known as ''John Laski''.\n\nAfter the [[Counter-Reformation]], when the Roman Catholic Church regained power in [[Poland]], the nobility became almost exclusively Catholic. Approximately 45% of the population were Roman Catholic or members of Protestant denominations, 36% were Greek Catholic, 4% Orthodox, of whom some were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] or the [[Armenian Catholic Church]]es and the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]. The remaining 15% were made up of a substantial minority of Jews.<ref>Kuklo C.

E. B. Du Bois]]. It is a seminal work in the [[history of sociology]] and a cornerstone of [[African-American literature]].\n\nThe book contains several essays on race, some of which the magazine ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' had previously published. To develop this work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an [[African Americans|African American]] in American society. Outside of its notable relevance in [[African-American history]], ''The Souls of Black Folk'' also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.\n\nIn ''The Souls of Black Folk'', Du Bois used the term \"[[double consciousness]]\", perhaps taken from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (\"The Transcendentalist\" and \"Fate\"), applying it to the idea that black people must have two fields of vision at all times. They must be conscious of how they view themselves, as well as being conscious of how the world views them.\n\n==Chapters==\nEach chapter in ''The Souls of Black Folk'' begins with a pair of epigraphs: text from a poem, usually by a European poet, and the musical score of a [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]], which Du Bois describes in his [[foreword]] (\"The Forethought\") as \"some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in the dark past\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink= |chapter=Introduction |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xx }}</ref> [[Columbia University]] English and [[comparative literature]] professor [[Brent Hayes Edwards]] writes:\n<blockquote>It is crucial to recognize that Du Bois ... chooses ''not'' to include the lyrics to the spirituals, which often serve to underline the arguments of the chapters: [[Booker T. Washington]]'s idealism is echoed in the otherworldly salvation hoped for in \"A Great Camp-Meeting in the Promised Land\", for example; likewise the determined call for education in \"Of the Training of Black Men\" is matched by the strident words of \"March On\".<ref name=Edwards>{{cite book |first= |last=Edwards |authorlink= |chapter=Introduction |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=xxi }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEdwards adds that Du Bois may have withheld the lyrics to mark a barrier for the reader, to suggest that black culture\u2014life \"within the veil\"\u2014remains inaccessible to white people.<ref name=Edwards/>\n\nIn \"The Forethought\", Du Bois states: \n<blockquote>\"Leaving, then, the world of the white man, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses,\u2014the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls.\"  He concludes with the words: \"...need I add that I who speak here am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?\"<ref name=\"WEB\">{{cite book|last1=Du Bois|first1=W. E. B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|date=1903|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0140189988|pages=1\u20132}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\" ===\n\nChapter I, \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\", lays out an overview of Du Bois's thesis. He says that the blacks of the South need the right to vote, the right to a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. Here, he also coined \"[[double-consciousness]]\", defined as a \"sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\"<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''The Souls of Black Folk''.  1903.[http://www.bartleby.com/114/1.html \"Chap. I: Of Our Spiritual Strivings\"], at ''Bartleby.com''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"One ever feels his twoness,\u2014an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.  The History of the American Negro is the history of this strive-this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self.  He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|5}}</blockquote>\n\nThe first chapter also introduces Du Bois's famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities are so vastly different from those of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the color line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse.<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|year=1903|publisher=Bantam Classic|location=New York|pages=197}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"In those sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose before him, and he saw himself,-darkly as through a veil; and yet he saw in himself some faint revelation of his power, of his mission.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|9}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Dawn of Freedom\" ===\n\nThe second chapter, \"Of the Dawn of Freedom\", covers the period of history from 1861 to 1872 and the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].  Du Bois also introduces the problem of the color-line.\n\n<blockquote>\"The Problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,\u2014the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|13}}</blockquote>\n\nDu Bois describes the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] as \"one of the most singular and interesting of the attempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race and social condition.\" He says that the bureau was \"one of the great landmarks of political and social progress.\"  After a year's work, Du Bois states that \"it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England school-ma'am.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|14, 21\u201322}}\n\n<blockquote>\"The greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of the free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary education among all classes in the South.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|28}}</blockquote>\n\nHe gives credit to the creation of [[Fisk University]], [[Clark Atlanta University]], [[Howard University]], and [[Hampton University]] and acknowledges the \"apostles of human culture\" [[Edmund Asa Ware]], [[Samuel C. Armstrong]], and [[Erastus Cravath]].  He worried that the demise of the [[Freedman's Savings Bank]], which resulted in huge losses for many freedmen of any savings, resulted in freedmen losing \"all the faith in savings\".<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|28\u201329, 32}}\n\nFinally, he argues that \"if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white votes, we certainly can with black votes.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|33}}\n<blockquote>\"...the granting of the ballot to the black man was a necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race, and the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of the war. Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race feud.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|33}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\" ===\n\nChapters III and VI deal with education and progress. Here Du Bois argues against [[Booker T. Washington]]'s idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Washington.html|title=Educational Theory of Booker T. Washington|last=Stocker|first=Maureen S. |date=|website=New Foundations|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> He advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community.\n\nDu Bois refers to the [[Atlanta Compromise]] as the \"most notable of Mr. Washington's career,\" and \"the old attitude of adjustment and submission.\"  Du Bois claims that Washington wants black people to give up three things: political power, insistence on civil rights, and higher education. He fears that, if black people \"concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South,\" this will lead to 1) The disenfranchisement of the Negro, 2) The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro, and 3) The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro.\"  By Washington focusing on \"common-school and industrial training,\" he \"depreciates institutions of higher learning,\" where \"teachers, professional men, and leaders\" are trained.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|37, 43\u201346}}\n\n<blockquote>\n\"But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds,\u2014so far as he, the South, or the Nation, does this,\u2014we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|50}}\n</blockquote>\n\nNote: By the time Du Bois published his book, most of the former Confederate states had completed disenfranchisement of blacks, led by Mississippi in 1890, by constitutional amendments and other laws raising barriers to voter registration, primarily through poll taxes, residency and recordkeeping requirements, subjective literacy tests and other devices. Virginia passed similar laws in 1908. By excluding blacks from political life, southern legislatures were able to pass [[Jim Crow]] laws and other discriminatory methods. \n\n=== \"Of the Meaning of Progress\" ===\n\nIn the fourth chapter, \"Of the Meaning of Progress\", Du Bois explores his experiences first, when he was teaching in Tennessee. Secondly he returned after 10 years and found the town where he had worked had suffered many unpleasant changes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Souls of Black Folk|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|publisher=|year=1903|isbn=978-0758331403|location=|pages=49\u201357|via=}}</ref> He says: \"My log schoolhouse was gone. In its place stood Progress; and Progress, I understand, is necessarily ugly.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|59}}\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee-beyond the Veil- was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|51}}\n</blockquote>\n\nYet, he states, after meeting with the commissioner, \"but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first, then I-alone.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|53}}\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it; and yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness, sprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a common hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all, from the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|57}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Wings of Atlanta\" <!-- please don't \"fix\" the spelling; it's a reference to the character in Greek mythology, not Atlanta, Georgia --> ===\nThe fifth chapter is a meditation on the necessity of widespread higher education in the South.\n\nDu Bois compares [[Atlanta]], the City of a Hundred Hills, to [[Atalanta]], and warns against the \"greed of gold,\" or \"interpreting the world in dollars.\"  The \"Black World beyond the Veil\", should not succumb \"Truth, Beauty, and Goodness,\" to the ideal of wealth attainment in public schools.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|66\u201363}}\n\n<blockquote>\"...beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the Veil of Race.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|66\u201367}}</blockquote>\n\nHe admonishes readers to \"Teach workers to work, and Teach thinkers to think.\"  \"The need of the South is knowledge and culture,\" he says:<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|71\u201372}}\n<blockquote>\"And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,\u2014not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|72}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Training of Black Men\" ===\nDu Bois discusses how \"to solve the problem of training men for life,\" especially as it relates to the Negro, who \"hang between them and a light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through.\"  Du Bois cites the progress of Southern education, consisting of army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedman's Bureau, from the end of the Civil War until 1876.  Then complete school systems were established including [[Normal school]]s and colleges, followed by the industrial revolution in the South from 1885 to 1895, and its industrial schools.  Yet, he asks, \"Is Not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|75\u201379}}\n\nDu Bois asserts: \"...education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning,\" is the right of the black as well as the white.  He goes on to state, \"If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself,\" and cites the 30,000 black teachers created in one generation who \"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made [[Tuskegee Institute|Tuskegee]] possible.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|79\u201389}} \n\nAdditionally, 2500 Negroes had received a bachelor's degree, of whom 53% became teachers or leaders of educational systems, 17% became clergymen, 17% mainly physicians, 6% merchants, farmers and artisans; and 4% in government service.  From 1875 to 1880, there were 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges and 143 from Southern Negro colleges.  From 1895 to 1900, Northern colleges graduated 100 Negros and over 500 graduated from Southern Negro colleges.  Du Bois concludes by stating that the \"...inevitable problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|79\u201389}}\n\n<blockquote>\"The function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of the Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact and co-operation.  And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|89\u201390}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Black Belt\" ===\nDu Bois calls [[Albany, Georgia]], in [[Dougherty County, Georgia|Dougherty County]], the \"heart of the Black Belt.\"  He says: \"Here are the remnants of the vast plantations.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|93\u201394, 96}}\n\n<blockquote>\"How curious a land is this,- how full of untold story, of tragedy and laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic past, and big with future promise!\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|100}}</blockquote>\n\nYet, he notes, it is not far from \"where [[Sam Hose]] was crucified\" [in a lynching], \"to-day the centre of the Negro problem,-the centre of those nine million men who are America's dark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade.\"  He continues: \"Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and vindictiveness there,\u2014these are the extremes of the Negro problem which we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|92, 106}}\n\n=== \"Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece\" ===\nSpeaking of the cotton fields from \"Carolina to Texas\", Du Bois claims an analogy between the \"ancient and modern \"Quest of the [[Golden Fleece]] in the Black Sea.\"  Continuing his discussion of Dougherty County, he explains that of the 1500 Negro families around Albany in 1898, many families have 8\u201310 individuals in one- or two-room homes.  These families are plagued with \"easy marriage and easy separation,\" a vestige of slavery, which the Negro church has done much to prevent \"a broken household.\"  He claims that most of the black population is \"poor and ignorant,\" more than 80 percent, though \"fairly honest and well meaning.\" \"Two-thirds of them cannot read or write,\" and 80 percent of the men, women and children are farmers.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|111\u2013118}}\n\nEconomically, the Negro has become a slave of debt, says Du Bois.  He describes the economic classes: the \"submerged tenth\" of [[sharecropping|croppers]], 40 percent are [[metayage|metayers]] or \"tenant on shares\" with a [[chattel mortgage]], 39 percent are semi-metayers and wage-laborers, while 5 percent are money-renters, and 6 percent [[freehold (law)|freeholders]].  Finally, du Bois states that only 6 percent \"have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship\", leading to a \"migration to town\", the \"buying of small homesteads near town\".<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|123, 128, 132}}\n\n=== \"Of the Sons of Master and Man\" ===\nThis chapter discusses \"race-contact\", specifically as it relates to physical proximity, economic and political relations, intellectual contact, social contact, and religious enterprise.  As for physical proximity, Du Bois states there is an obvious \"physical color-line\" in Southern communities separating whites from Negroes, and a Black Belt in larger areas of the country.  He says that here is a need for \"Negro leaders of character and intelligence\" to help guide Negro communities along the path out of the current economic situation.  The power of the ballot is necessary, he asserts, as \"in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected.\"  He says that \"the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves,\" and Negroes viewed its \"courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks.\"  Regarding social contact, Du Bois states \"there is almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and sympathy with thoughts and feelings of the other.\"  He concludes that \"the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other's position.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|134\u2013135, 140\u2013141, 144\u2013145, 152}}\n\n=== \"Of the Faith of the Fathers\" ===\n\nIn Chapter X, Du Bois describes the rise of the [[black church]] and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African Americans.\n\nAfter recounting his first exposure to the Southern Negro [[revival meeting|revival]], Du Bois notes three things that characterize this religion: the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy\u2014the Frenzy or Shouting being \"when the Spirit of the Lord passed by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy.\"  Du Bois says that the Negro church is the social center of Negro life.  Predominately Methodists or Baptists after Emancipation, when Emancipation finally, came Du Bois states, it seemed to the freedman a literal \"Coming of the Lord\".<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|154\u2013157, 164}}\n\n=== \"Of the Passing of the First-Born\" ===\n\nThe final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. In Chapter XI, \"Of the Passing of the First-Born\", Du Bois recounts the birth of his first child, a son, and his untimely death as an infant.\n\nDu Bois comments, \"Why was his hair tinted with gold?  An evil omen was golden hair in my life.\"  He says, \"I saw his breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt like a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in its train.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|170, 172}}\n\nDu Bois ends with, \"Sleep, then, child,\u2014sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless patter of little feet-above the Veil.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|175}}\n\n=== \"Of Alexander Crummell\" ===\nIn this chapter, Du Bois recounts a short biography of [[Alexander Crummell]], an early black priest in the Episcopal Church.\n\nDu Bois starts with, \"This is the history of a human heart.\" He notes that Crummell faced three temptations: those of Hate, Despair, and Doubt,\" while crossing two vales, the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|176}}\n\nDu Bois ends with, \"And now that he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose dear memory I bring this little tribute.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|185}}\n\n=== \"Of the Coming of John\" ===\n\nThe penultimate chapter, \"Of the Coming of John\", is fictional. Du Bois tells about John, an African American from [[Altamaha, Georgia]], who is sent to a good school. When he returns to his place, he discovers that \"[l]ittle had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue\" (Du Bois 170). John's return to the South has made him a foreigner in his own home. After he attempts to teach a class for the local children, John is compared to a different John, the son of wealthy Judge Henderson. John Henderson has become bored after his own return from college. He begins to sexually assault Jennie, the sister of black John, when the young white man sees her outside his home. John kills white John and bids his mother goodbye. In the final part of the story, there is an implication that he is about to be lynched by a gathering mob, and John \"softly hum[s] the 'Song of the Bride{{'\"}} in German. (Du Bois 176).\n\n=== \"The Sorrow Songs\" ===\n\nChapter XIV, \"The Sorrow Songs\", is about Negro music. He refers to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters. Du Bois mentions that the music was so powerful and meaningful that, regardless of the people's appearance and teaching, \"their hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|205}}  Du Bois concludes the chapter by bringing up inequality, race and discrimination. He says, \"Your country? How came it yours?..we were here\".<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. 1903. ''The Souls of Black Folk''. 1903. {{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/114/14.html|title=XIV. The Sorrow Songs. |website=Bartleby.com|access-date=September 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDu Bois heralds the \"melody of the slave songs\", or the Negro spirituals, as the \"articulate message of the slave to the world.\" They are the music, he contends, not of the joyous black slave, as a good many whites had misread them, but \"of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|year=1903|publisher=Bantam Classic|location=New York|pages=116, 117}}</ref> For Du Bois, the sorrow songs represented a black folk culture\u2014with its origins in slavery\u2014unadulterated by the civilizing impulses of a northern black church, increasingly obsessed with respectability and with Western aesthetic criteria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Davarian L.|title=Chicago's New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Black Urban Life|year=2007|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=160}}</ref> Rather than vestiges of a backward time that should be purged from black repertoires and isolated from what [[Alain Locke]] called the \"modernization of the negro\" (coincident, for Locke, with urbanization), negro spirituals are\u2014for Du Bois\u2014where the souls of black folk past and present are found.\n\nDu Bois passionately advocated for the preservation of the spiritual, along with [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and contemporary black aestheticians, including [[Harry Burleigh]], [[Robert Nathaniel Dett]], [[Alain Locke]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=|title=Chicago's New Negroes|year=2007|publisher=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> It is in the retrieval of black cultural folkways\u2014particularly \"The Sorrow Songs\"\u2014that one of the major complications of Du Bois's project and, later, the [[Harlem Renaissance]] (where Hurston and Locke<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=Eric J.|title=To Wake the Nations: Race in the Making of American Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/towakenationsrac00sund|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/towakenationsrac00sund/page/468 468\u2013470]}}</ref> debut their own retrievals) surfaces.

''The Souls of Black Folk'' occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. \"Souls\" justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the [[black middle class]]. By describing a global color-line, Du Bois anticipated [[pan-Africanism]] and colonial revolutions in the [[Third World]]. Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as '[[whiteness studies]]' a century later.<ref>Marable, Manning (2011), ''Living Black History: How Reimagining the African-American Past Can Remake America's Racial Future'', p. 96. {{ISBN|9780465043958}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the time of its publication, the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' warned of ''The Souls of Black Folk'', \"This book is dangerous for the Negro to read, for it will only incite discontent and fill his imagination with things that do not exist, or things that should not bear upon his mind.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Books Noted|last = |first = |date = June 1964|journal = Negro Digest|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 52}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' said, \"A review of [the work of the Freedmen's Bureau] from the negro point of view, even the Northern negro's point of view, must have its value to any unprejudiced student\u2014still more, perhaps, for the prejudiced who is yet willing to be a student.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/05/specials/dubois-souls.html |title=The Negro Question |date=April 25, 1903 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn his introduction to the 1961 edition, writer Saunders Redding observed, \"The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|boycott of the buses in Montgomery]] had many roots . . . but none more important than this little book of essays published more than half a century ago.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Literary reception ===\nAs [[Yale University|Yale]] professor [[Hazel Carby]] points out, for black writers before the abolition of slavery in 1865, it was impossible \"even to imagine the option of returning to the South once black humanity and freedom had been gained in the North\", and it was rarely found in later literature as well.<ref name=\"Carby, Hazel V. 1998. p. 16\">Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. p. 16.</ref> While the narratives of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Harriet Ann Jacobs]] move towards the North and freedom, Du Bois reverses \"the direction of the archetypal journey of these original narratives\" and focuses on the Black Belt of the South.<ref name=\"Carby, Hazel V. 1998. p. 16\"/> Although the text \"consistently shifts between a predominantly white and a predominantly black world\", in line with Du Bois's concept of double consciousness, \"its overall narrative impulse gradually moves the focus from a white terrain to an autonomous black one.\"<ref>Carby, ''Race Men'', 1998. p. 17.</ref>\n\nCarby traces the ways in which Du Bois gendered his narrative of black folk, but also how Du Bois's conceptual framework is gendered as well. According to Carby, it seems that Du Bois in this book is most concerned with how race and nation intersect, and how such an intersection is based on particular masculine notions of progress. According to Carby, Du Bois \"exposes and exploits the tension that exists between the internal egalitarianism of the nation and the relations of domination and subordination embodied in a racially encoded social hierarchy.\" So Du Bois makes a conceptual argument that racialization is actually compatible with the nation in so far as it creates unified races. However, this unified race is only possible through the gendered narrative that he constructs throughout ''Souls'', which renders black male intellectuals (himself) as the (only possible) leader(s) of the unified race. Carby explains that \"in order to retain his credentials for leadership, Du Bois had to situate himself as both an exceptional and a representative individual.... The terms and conditions of his exceptionalism, Du Bois argues, have their source in his formation as a gendered intellectual.\"<ref>Carby, ''Race Men'', 1998. pp. 30\u201331.</ref> According to Carby, Du Bois was concerned with \"the reproduction of Race Men\". In other words, \"the figure of the intellectual and race leader is born of and engendered by other males.\"<ref>Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. pp. 25\u201326.</ref> \n\nSuch a reading of Du Bois calls attention to \"queer meanings\" that, according to Charles Nero, are inherent in ''Souls''. Nero, who uses Anne Herrmann's definition of queer, conceptualizes queerness as the \"recognition on the part of others that one is not like others, a subject out of order, not in sequence, not working.\"<ref name=\"nero\"/> Foundational to Nero's argument is the understanding that men have the authority to exchange women among one another in order to form a \"homosocial contract\". Nero analyzes Du Bois's discussion on the Teutonic and Submissive Man to conclude that such a contract would lead to a \"round and full development\" to produce a \"great civilization\". However, Nero is concerned with violence and the \"rigid policing of sexual identity categories at the turn of the century\", which ultimately made such a homosocial, biracial contract impossible.<ref name=\"nero\"/>\n\nNero marks \"Of the Coming of John\" as a central chapter that demonstrates his queer reading of ''Souls''. Nero argues that John Jones's absence of masculinity is a sign of his queerness and that the killing of his \"double\" represents Du Bois's disillusionment with the idea that a biracial and homosocial society can exist.<ref name=\"nero\">Nero, Charles, \"Queering the Souls of Black Folk,\" ''Public Cultures'' 17, no. 2 (2005).</ref>\n\n=== Cultural and religious criticism ===\nDu Bois had transdisciplinary training and he provided a historical context for black religion and culture. His concept of \"double-consciousness\" and other concepts from ''Souls'' have been highly influential on other scholars in their interpretations of black culture and religion. Cheryl Sanders, a professor of Christian ethics at [[Howard University]] School of Divinity, lists a \"who's who\" of Du Bois progeny in her scholarly work, including [[Paul Gilroy]], [[C. Eric Lincoln]], Lawrence Mamiya, Peter Paris, Emilie Townes and [[Cornel West]]. These are some of the scholars who take up themes or concepts found in ''Souls'' for their own work in religious and theological studies or cultural criticism.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=Cheryl J.|publisher=Oxford|year=1999|isbn=978-0195131017|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/saintsinexilehol0000sand/page/125 125]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/saintsinexilehol0000sand/page/125}}</ref> Additionally, Victor Anderson, a philosophical theologian and cultural critic at [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]] and the author of ''Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism'', links concepts from ''Souls'' to much of the work in black religious studies.\n\nIn ''Beyond Ontological Blackness'', Victor Anderson seeks to critique a trope of \"black heroic genius\" articulated within the logics of ontological blackness as a philosophy of racial consciousness.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism|last=Anderson|first=Victor|publisher=Continuum|year=1995|isbn=978-0826408655|location=New York|pages=13\u201314|quote=|via=}}</ref> At the center of this conception is Du Bois. \n\nAnderson says, \n<blockquote>\"W. E. B. Du Bois's double-consciousness depiction of black existence has come to epitomize the existential determinants of black self-consciousness. These alienated forms of black consciousness have been categorically defined in African-American cultural studies as: The Negro Problem, The Color Line, Black Experience, Black Power, The Veil of Blackness, Black Radicalism, and most recently, The Black Sacred Cosmos.\"<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Anderson's critique of black heroic genius and a move towards black cultural fulfillment is an attempt to move beyond the categories deployed by Du Bois in ''Souls''.\n\nSimilarly, popopopopooo Sanders critiques Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness, especially in terms of interpreting black holiness-Pentecostalism. In Sanders's work, ''Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture'', Sanders deploys a dialectical understanding of exile, which she characterizes in black holiness-Pentecostal terms as \"Being in the world, but not of it.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=5\u20136|quote=|via=}}</ref> At the same time, Sanders wishes to contrast this to the double-consciousness dialect of Du Bois, at least as she understands it. For Sanders, \"exilic dialectics\" is \"hoped to represent a progressive step beyond the 'double-consciousness' described by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1903, which persists as the dominant paradigm in African American religious and cultural thought.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=Cheryl J.|publisher=Oxford|year=1999|isbn=978-0195131017|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/saintsinexilehol0000sand/page/124 124]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/saintsinexilehol0000sand/page/124}}</ref>\n\nDescribing exilic consciousness as between \"both-and\", and double-consciousness as \"either-or\", Sanders says  that those who live in exile \"can find equilibrium and fulfillment between extremes, whereas adherents to the latter either demand resolution or suffer greatly in the tension, as is the case with Du Bois's description of the agony of 'double-consciousness,' as 'two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.'\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Textual changes==\nIn 1953, ''The Souls of Black Folk'' was published in a special \"Fiftieth Anniversary Jubilee Edition\". In his introduction, Du Bois wrote that in the 50 years since its publication, he occasionally had the inclination to revise the book but ultimately decided to leave it as it was, \"as a monument to what I thought and felt in 1903\". While he stuck by his decision, he wrote that in the new edition he had made \"less than a half-dozen alterations in word or phrase and then not to change my thoughts as previously set down but to avoid any possible misunderstanding today of what I meant to say yesterday.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

Historian and literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] and a team of readers performed a line-by-line comparison of the two editions during the 1980s and identified two more changes. All the changes are minor; the longest was to change \"nephews and poor whites and the Jews\" to \"poor relations and foreign immigrants\". In six of the nine changes, Du Bois changed references to Jews to refer to immigrants or foreigners. Two of the other changes also involved references to Jews.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink= |chapter=Note on the Text |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xxv }}</ref>\n\nDu Bois wrote to Aptheker in February 1953 about concerns he had with his references to Jews in the book:\n<blockquote>I have had a chance to read [''The Souls of Black Folk''] in part for the first time in years. I find in chapters VII, VII and IX, five incidental references to Jews. I recall that years ago, [[Jacob Schiff]] wrote me criticising these references and that I denied any thought of race or religious prejudice and promised to go over the passages in future editions. These editions succeeded each other without any consultation with me, and evidently the matter slipped out of my mind.<br>As I re-read these words today, I see that harm might come if they were allowed to stand as they are. First of all, I am not at all sure that the foreign exploiters to whom I referred ... were in fact Jews.... But even if they were, what I was condemning was the exploitation and not the race nor religion. And I did not, when writing, realize that by stressing the name of the group instead of what some members of the [group] may have done, I was unjustly maligning a people in exactly the same way my folk were then and are now falsely accused.<br>In view of this and because of the even greater danger of injustice now than then, I want in the event of re-publication [to] change those passages.<ref>{{cite letter |first=W.

This at the time I stoutly denied; but as I read the passages again in the light of subsequent history, I see how I laid myself open to this possible misapprehension. What, of course, I meant to condemn was the exploitation of black labor and that it was in this country and at that time in part a matter of immigrant Jews, was incidental and not essential. My inner sympathy with the Jewish people was expressed better in the last paragraph of page 152.

E. B. Du Bois]]. It is a seminal work in the [[history of sociology]] and a cornerstone of [[African-American literature]].\n\nThe book contains several essays on race, some of which the magazine ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' had previously published. To develop this work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an [[African Americans|African American]] in American society. Outside of its notable relevance in [[African-American history]], ''The Souls of Black Folk'' also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology.\n\nIn ''The Souls of Black Folk'', Du Bois used the term \"[[double consciousness]]\", perhaps taken from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (\"The Transcendentalist\" and \"Fate\"), applying it to the idea that black people must have two fields of vision at all times. They must be conscious of how they view themselves, as well as being conscious of how the world views them.\n\n==Chapters==\nEach chapter in ''The Souls of Black Folk'' begins with a pair of epigraphs: text from a poem, usually by a European poet, and the musical score of a [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]], which Du Bois describes in his [[foreword]] (\"The Forethought\") as \"some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in the dark past\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink= |chapter=Introduction |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xx }}</ref> [[Columbia University]] English and [[comparative literature]] professor [[Brent Hayes Edwards]] writes:\n<blockquote>It is crucial to recognize that Du Bois ... chooses ''not'' to include the lyrics to the spirituals, which often serve to underline the arguments of the chapters: [[Booker T. Washington]]'s idealism is echoed in the otherworldly salvation hoped for in \"A Great Camp-Meeting in the Promised Land\", for example; likewise the determined call for education in \"Of the Training of Black Men\" is matched by the strident words of \"March On\".<ref name=Edwards>{{cite book |first= |last=Edwards |authorlink= |chapter=Introduction |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=xxi }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEdwards adds that Du Bois may have withheld the lyrics to mark a barrier for the reader, to suggest that black culture\u2014life \"within the veil\"\u2014remains inaccessible to white people.<ref name=Edwards/>\n\nIn \"The Forethought\", Du Bois states: \n<blockquote>\"Leaving, then, the world of the white man, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses,\u2014the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls.\"  He concludes with the words: \"...need I add that I who speak here am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?\"<ref name=\"WEB\">{{cite book|last1=Du Bois|first1=W.

He says that the blacks of the South need the right to vote, the right to a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. Here, he also coined \"[[double-consciousness]]\", defined as a \"sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\"<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. ''The Souls of Black Folk''.  1903.[http://www.bartleby.com/114/1.html \"Chap. I: Of Our Spiritual Strivings\"], at ''Bartleby.com''</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"One ever feels his twoness,\u2014an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.  The History of the American Negro is the history of this strive-this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self.  He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|5}}</blockquote>\n\nThe first chapter also introduces Du Bois's famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities are so vastly different from those of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the color line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse.<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W.

Du Bois also introduces the problem of the color-line.\n\n<blockquote>\"The Problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,\u2014the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|13}}</blockquote>\n\nDu Bois describes the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] as \"one of the most singular and interesting of the attempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race and social condition.\" He says that the bureau was \"one of the great landmarks of political and social progress.\"  After a year's work, Du Bois states that \"it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England school-ma'am.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|14, 21\u201322}}\n\n<blockquote>\"The greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of the free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary education among all classes in the South.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|28}}</blockquote>\n\nHe gives credit to the creation of [[Fisk University]], [[Clark Atlanta University]], [[Howard University]], and [[Hampton University]] and acknowledges the \"apostles of human culture\" [[Edmund Asa Ware]], [[Samuel C. Armstrong]], and [[Erastus Cravath]].  He worried that the demise of the [[Freedman's Savings Bank]], which resulted in huge losses for many freedmen of any savings, resulted in freedmen losing \"all the faith in savings\".<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|28\u201329, 32}}\n\nFinally, he argues that \"if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white votes, we certainly can with black votes.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|33}}\n<blockquote>\"...the granting of the ballot to the black man was a necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race, and the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of the war. Thus Negro suffrage ended a civil war by beginning a race feud.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|33}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\" ===\n\nChapters III and VI deal with education and progress. Here Du Bois argues against [[Booker T. Washington]]'s idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/GALLERY/Washington.html|title=Educational Theory of Booker T. Washington|last=Stocker|first=Maureen S. |date=|website=New Foundations|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> He advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community.\n\nDu Bois refers to the [[Atlanta Compromise]] as the \"most notable of Mr. Washington's career,\" and \"the old attitude of adjustment and submission.\"  Du Bois claims that Washington wants black people to give up three things: political power, insistence on civil rights, and higher education. He fears that, if black people \"concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South,\" this will lead to 1) The disenfranchisement of the Negro, 2) The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro, and 3) The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro.\"  By Washington focusing on \"common-school and industrial training,\" he \"depreciates institutions of higher learning,\" where \"teachers, professional men, and leaders\" are trained.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|37, 43\u201346}}\n\n<blockquote>\n\"But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds,\u2014so far as he, the South, or the Nation, does this,\u2014we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|50}}\n</blockquote>\n\nNote: By the time Du Bois published his book, most of the former Confederate states had completed disenfranchisement of blacks, led by Mississippi in 1890, by constitutional amendments and other laws raising barriers to voter registration, primarily through poll taxes, residency and recordkeeping requirements, subjective literacy tests and other devices. Virginia passed similar laws in 1908. By excluding blacks from political life, southern legislatures were able to pass [[Jim Crow]] laws and other discriminatory methods. \n\n=== \"Of the Meaning of Progress\" ===\n\nIn the fourth chapter, \"Of the Meaning of Progress\", Du Bois explores his experiences first, when he was teaching in Tennessee. Secondly he returned after 10 years and found the town where he had worked had suffered many unpleasant changes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Souls of Black Folk|last=Du Bois|first=W. E.

In its place stood Progress; and Progress, I understand, is necessarily ugly.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|59}}\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee-beyond the Veil- was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|51}}\n</blockquote>\n\nYet, he states, after meeting with the commissioner, \"but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first, then I-alone.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|53}}\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it; and yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness, sprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a common hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all, from the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|57}}\n</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Wings of Atlanta\" <!-- please don't \"fix\" the spelling; it's a reference to the character in Greek mythology, not Atlanta, Georgia --> ===\nThe fifth chapter is a meditation on the necessity of widespread higher education in the South.\n\nDu Bois compares [[Atlanta]], the City of a Hundred Hills, to [[Atalanta]], and warns against the \"greed of gold,\" or \"interpreting the world in dollars.\"  The \"Black World beyond the Veil\", should not succumb \"Truth, Beauty, and Goodness,\" to the ideal of wealth attainment in public schools.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|66\u201363}}\n\n<blockquote>\"...beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the Veil of Race.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|66\u201367}}</blockquote>\n\nHe admonishes readers to \"Teach workers to work, and Teach thinkers to think.\"  \"The need of the South is knowledge and culture,\" he says:<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|71\u201372}}\n<blockquote>\"And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,\u2014not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|72}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Training of Black Men\" ===\nDu Bois discusses how \"to solve the problem of training men for life,\" especially as it relates to the Negro, who \"hang between them and a light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through.\"  Du Bois cites the progress of Southern education, consisting of army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedman's Bureau, from the end of the Civil War until 1876.  Then complete school systems were established including [[Normal school]]s and colleges, followed by the industrial revolution in the South from 1885 to 1895, and its industrial schools.  Yet, he asks, \"Is Not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|75\u201379}}\n\nDu Bois asserts: \"...education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning,\" is the right of the black as well as the white.  He goes on to state, \"If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself,\" and cites the 30,000 black teachers created in one generation who \"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made [[Tuskegee Institute|Tuskegee]] possible.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|79\u201389}} \n\nAdditionally, 2500 Negroes had received a bachelor's degree, of whom 53% became teachers or leaders of educational systems, 17% became clergymen, 17% mainly physicians, 6% merchants, farmers and artisans; and 4% in government service.  From 1875 to 1880, there were 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges and 143 from Southern Negro colleges.  From 1895 to 1900, Northern colleges graduated 100 Negros and over 500 graduated from Southern Negro colleges.  Du Bois concludes by stating that the \"...inevitable problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|79\u201389}}\n\n<blockquote>\"The function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of the Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact and co-operation.  And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|89\u201390}}</blockquote>\n\n=== \"Of the Black Belt\" ===\nDu Bois calls [[Albany, Georgia]], in [[Dougherty County, Georgia|Dougherty County]], the \"heart of the Black Belt.\"  He says: \"Here are the remnants of the vast plantations.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|93\u201394, 96}}\n\n<blockquote>\"How curious a land is this,- how full of untold story, of tragedy and laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic past, and big with future promise!\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|100}}</blockquote>\n\nYet, he notes, it is not far from \"where [[Sam Hose]] was crucified\" [in a lynching], \"to-day the centre of the Negro problem,-the centre of those nine million men who are America's dark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade.\"  He continues: \"Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and vindictiveness there,\u2014these are the extremes of the Negro problem which we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|92, 106}}\n\n=== \"Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece\" ===\nSpeaking of the cotton fields from \"Carolina to Texas\", Du Bois claims an analogy between the \"ancient and modern \"Quest of the [[Golden Fleece]] in the Black Sea.\"  Continuing his discussion of Dougherty County, he explains that of the 1500 Negro families around Albany in 1898, many families have 8\u201310 individuals in one- or two-room homes.  These families are plagued with \"easy marriage and easy separation,\" a vestige of slavery, which the Negro church has done much to prevent \"a broken household.\"  He claims that most of the black population is \"poor and ignorant,\" more than 80 percent, though \"fairly honest and well meaning.\" \"Two-thirds of them cannot read or write,\" and 80 percent of the men, women and children are farmers.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|111\u2013118}}\n\nEconomically, the Negro has become a slave of debt, says Du Bois.  He describes the economic classes: the \"submerged tenth\" of [[sharecropping|croppers]], 40 percent are [[metayage|metayers]] or \"tenant on shares\" with a [[chattel mortgage]], 39 percent are semi-metayers and wage-laborers, while 5 percent are money-renters, and 6 percent [[freehold (law)|freeholders]].  Finally, du Bois states that only 6 percent \"have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship\", leading to a \"migration to town\", the \"buying of small homesteads near town\".<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|123, 128, 132}}\n\n=== \"Of the Sons of Master and Man\" ===\nThis chapter discusses \"race-contact\", specifically as it relates to physical proximity, economic and political relations, intellectual contact, social contact, and religious enterprise.  As for physical proximity, Du Bois states there is an obvious \"physical color-line\" in Southern communities separating whites from Negroes, and a Black Belt in larger areas of the country.  He says that here is a need for \"Negro leaders of character and intelligence\" to help guide Negro communities along the path out of the current economic situation.  The power of the ballot is necessary, he asserts, as \"in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected.\"  He says that \"the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves,\" and Negroes viewed its \"courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks.\"  Regarding social contact, Du Bois states \"there is almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and sympathy with thoughts and feelings of the other.\"  He concludes that \"the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other's position.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|134\u2013135, 140\u2013141, 144\u2013145, 152}}\n\n=== \"Of the Faith of the Fathers\" ===\n\nIn Chapter X, Du Bois describes the rise of the [[black church]] and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African Americans.\n\nAfter recounting his first exposure to the Southern Negro [[revival meeting|revival]], Du Bois notes three things that characterize this religion: the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy\u2014the Frenzy or Shouting being \"when the Spirit of the Lord passed by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy.\"  Du Bois says that the Negro church is the social center of Negro life.  Predominately Methodists or Baptists after Emancipation, when Emancipation finally, came Du Bois states, it seemed to the freedman a literal \"Coming of the Lord\".<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|154\u2013157, 164}}\n\n=== \"Of the Passing of the First-Born\" ===\n\nThe final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. In Chapter XI, \"Of the Passing of the First-Born\", Du Bois recounts the birth of his first child, a son, and his untimely death as an infant.\n\nDu Bois comments, \"Why was his hair tinted with gold?  An evil omen was golden hair in my life.\"  He says, \"I saw his breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt like a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in its train.<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|170, 172}}\n\nDu Bois ends with, \"Sleep, then, child,\u2014sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless patter of little feet-above the Veil.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|175}}\n\n=== \"Of Alexander Crummell\" ===\nIn this chapter, Du Bois recounts a short biography of [[Alexander Crummell]], an early black priest in the Episcopal Church.\n\nDu Bois starts with, \"This is the history of a human heart.\" He notes that Crummell faced three temptations: those of Hate, Despair, and Doubt,\" while crossing two vales, the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|176}}\n\nDu Bois ends with, \"And now that he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose dear memory I bring this little tribute.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|185}}\n\n=== \"Of the Coming of John\" ===\n\nThe penultimate chapter, \"Of the Coming of John\", is fictional. Du Bois tells about John, an African American from [[Altamaha, Georgia]], who is sent to a good school. When he returns to his place, he discovers that \"[l]ittle had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue\" (Du Bois 170). John's return to the South has made him a foreigner in his own home. After he attempts to teach a class for the local children, John is compared to a different John, the son of wealthy Judge Henderson. John Henderson has become bored after his own return from college. He begins to sexually assault Jennie, the sister of black John, when the young white man sees her outside his home. John kills white John and bids his mother goodbye. In the final part of the story, there is an implication that he is about to be lynched by a gathering mob, and John \"softly hum[s] the 'Song of the Bride{{'\"}} in German. (Du Bois 176).\n\n=== \"The Sorrow Songs\" ===\n\nChapter XIV, \"The Sorrow Songs\", is about Negro music. He refers to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters. Du Bois mentions that the music was so powerful and meaningful that, regardless of the people's appearance and teaching, \"their hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.\"<ref name=WEB/>{{rp|205}}  Du Bois concludes the chapter by bringing up inequality, race and discrimination. He says, \"Your country? How came it yours?..we were here\".<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B. 1903. ''The Souls of Black Folk''. 1903. {{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/114/14.html|title=XIV. The Sorrow Songs. |website=Bartleby.com|access-date=September 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDu Bois heralds the \"melody of the slave songs\", or the Negro spirituals, as the \"articulate message of the slave to the world.\" They are the music, he contends, not of the joyous black slave, as a good many whites had misread them, but \"of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=The Souls of Black Folk|year=1903|publisher=Bantam Classic|location=New York|pages=116, 117}}</ref> For Du Bois, the sorrow songs represented a black folk culture\u2014with its origins in slavery\u2014unadulterated by the civilizing impulses of a northern black church, increasingly obsessed with respectability and with Western aesthetic criteria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Davarian L.|title=Chicago's New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Black Urban Life|year=2007|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|pages=160}}</ref> Rather than vestiges of a backward time that should be purged from black repertoires and isolated from what [[Alain Locke]] called the \"modernization of the negro\" (coincident, for Locke, with urbanization), negro spirituals are\u2014for Du Bois\u2014where the souls of black folk past and present are found.\n\nDu Bois passionately advocated for the preservation of the spiritual, along with [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and contemporary black aestheticians, including [[Harry Burleigh]], [[Robert Nathaniel Dett]], [[Alain Locke]] and [[Zora Neale Hurston]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=|title=Chicago's New Negroes|year=2007|publisher=|location=|pages=161}}</ref> It is in the retrieval of black cultural folkways\u2014particularly \"The Sorrow Songs\"\u2014that one of the major complications of Du Bois's project and, later, the [[Harlem Renaissance]] (where Hurston and Locke<ref>{{cite book|last=Sundquist|first=Eric J.|title=To Wake the Nations: Race in the Making of American Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/towakenationsrac00sund|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/towakenationsrac00sund/page/468 468\u2013470]}}</ref> debut their own retrievals) surfaces.

''The Souls of Black Folk'' occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. \"Souls\" justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the [[black middle class]]. By describing a global color-line, Du Bois anticipated [[pan-Africanism]] and colonial revolutions in the [[Third World]]. Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as '[[whiteness studies]]' a century later.<ref>Marable, Manning (2011), ''Living Black History: How Reimagining the African-American Past Can Remake America's Racial Future'', p. 96. {{ISBN|9780465043958}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the time of its publication, the ''[[Nashville Banner]]'' warned of ''The Souls of Black Folk'', \"This book is dangerous for the Negro to read, for it will only incite discontent and fill his imagination with things that do not exist, or things that should not bear upon his mind.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Books Noted|last = |first = |date = June 1964|journal = Negro Digest|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 52}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' said, \"A review of [the work of the Freedmen's Bureau] from the negro point of view, even the Northern negro's point of view, must have its value to any unprejudiced student\u2014still more, perhaps, for the prejudiced who is yet willing to be a student.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/05/specials/dubois-souls.html |title=The Negro Question |date=April 25, 1903 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn his introduction to the 1961 edition, writer Saunders Redding observed, \"The [[Montgomery Bus Boycott|boycott of the buses in Montgomery]] had many roots . . . but none more important than this little book of essays published more than half a century ago.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Literary reception ===\nAs [[Yale University|Yale]] professor [[Hazel Carby]] points out, for black writers before the abolition of slavery in 1865, it was impossible \"even to imagine the option of returning to the South once black humanity and freedom had been gained in the North\", and it was rarely found in later literature as well.<ref name=\"Carby, Hazel V. 1998. p. 16\">Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. p. 16.</ref> While the narratives of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Harriet Ann Jacobs]] move towards the North and freedom, Du Bois reverses \"the direction of the archetypal journey of these original narratives\" and focuses on the Black Belt of the South.<ref name=\"Carby, Hazel V. 1998. p. 16\"/> Although the text \"consistently shifts between a predominantly white and a predominantly black world\", in line with Du Bois's concept of double consciousness, \"its overall narrative impulse gradually moves the focus from a white terrain to an autonomous black one.\"<ref>Carby, ''Race Men'', 1998. p. 17.</ref>\n\nCarby traces the ways in which Du Bois gendered his narrative of black folk, but also how Du Bois's conceptual framework is gendered as well. According to Carby, it seems that Du Bois in this book is most concerned with how race and nation intersect, and how such an intersection is based on particular masculine notions of progress. According to Carby, Du Bois \"exposes and exploits the tension that exists between the internal egalitarianism of the nation and the relations of domination and subordination embodied in a racially encoded social hierarchy.\" So Du Bois makes a conceptual argument that racialization is actually compatible with the nation in so far as it creates unified races. However, this unified race is only possible through the gendered narrative that he constructs throughout ''Souls'', which renders black male intellectuals (himself) as the (only possible) leader(s) of the unified race. Carby explains that \"in order to retain his credentials for leadership, Du Bois had to situate himself as both an exceptional and a representative individual.... The terms and conditions of his exceptionalism, Du Bois argues, have their source in his formation as a gendered intellectual.\"<ref>Carby, ''Race Men'', 1998. pp. 30\u201331.</ref> According to Carby, Du Bois was concerned with \"the reproduction of Race Men\". In other words, \"the figure of the intellectual and race leader is born of and engendered by other males.\"<ref>Carby, Hazel V. ''Race Men''. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. pp. 25\u201326.</ref> \n\nSuch a reading of Du Bois calls attention to \"queer meanings\" that, according to Charles Nero, are inherent in ''Souls''. Nero, who uses Anne Herrmann's definition of queer, conceptualizes queerness as the \"recognition on the part of others that one is not like others, a subject out of order, not in sequence, not working.\"<ref name=\"nero\"/> Foundational to Nero's argument is the understanding that men have the authority to exchange women among one another in order to form a \"homosocial contract\". Nero analyzes Du Bois's discussion on the Teutonic and Submissive Man to conclude that such a contract would lead to a \"round and full development\" to produce a \"great civilization\". However, Nero is concerned with violence and the \"rigid policing of sexual identity categories at the turn of the century\", which ultimately made such a homosocial, biracial contract impossible.<ref name=\"nero\"/>\n\nNero marks \"Of the Coming of John\" as a central chapter that demonstrates his queer reading of ''Souls''. Nero argues that John Jones's absence of masculinity is a sign of his queerness and that the killing of his \"double\" represents Du Bois's disillusionment with the idea that a biracial and homosocial society can exist.<ref name=\"nero\">Nero, Charles, \"Queering the Souls of Black Folk,\" ''Public Cultures'' 17, no. 2 (2005).</ref>\n\n=== Cultural and religious criticism ===\nDu Bois had transdisciplinary training and he provided a historical context for black religion and culture. His concept of \"double-consciousness\" and other concepts from ''Souls'' have been highly influential on other scholars in their interpretations of black culture and religion. Cheryl Sanders, a professor of Christian ethics at [[Howard University]] School of Divinity, lists a \"who's who\" of Du Bois progeny in her scholarly work, including [[Paul Gilroy]], [[C. Eric Lincoln]], Lawrence Mamiya, Peter Paris, Emilie Townes and [[Cornel West]]. These are some of the scholars who take up themes or concepts found in ''Souls'' for their own work in religious and theological studies or cultural criticism.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=Cheryl J.|publisher=Oxford|year=1999|isbn=978-0195131017|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/saintsinexilehol0000sand/page/125 125]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/saintsinexilehol0000sand/page/125}}</ref> Additionally, Victor Anderson, a philosophical theologian and cultural critic at [[Vanderbilt University Divinity School]] and the author of ''Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism'', links concepts from ''Souls'' to much of the work in black religious studies.\n\nIn ''Beyond Ontological Blackness'', Victor Anderson seeks to critique a trope of \"black heroic genius\" articulated within the logics of ontological blackness as a philosophy of racial consciousness.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism|last=Anderson|first=Victor|publisher=Continuum|year=1995|isbn=978-0826408655|location=New York|pages=13\u201314|quote=|via=}}</ref> At the center of this conception is Du Bois. \n\nAnderson says, \n<blockquote>\"W. E. B. Du Bois's double-consciousness depiction of black existence has come to epitomize the existential determinants of black self-consciousness. These alienated forms of black consciousness have been categorically defined in African-American cultural studies as: The Negro Problem, The Color Line, Black Experience, Black Power, The Veil of Blackness, Black Radicalism, and most recently, The Black Sacred Cosmos.\"<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Anderson's critique of black heroic genius and a move towards black cultural fulfillment is an attempt to move beyond the categories deployed by Du Bois in ''Souls''.\n\nSimilarly, Sanders critiques Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness, especially in terms of interpreting black holiness-Pentecostalism. In Sanders's work, ''Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture'', Sanders deploys a dialectical understanding of exile, which she characterizes in black holiness-Pentecostal terms as \"Being in the world, but not of it.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture|last=Sanders|first=|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=5\u20136|quote=|via=}}</ref> At the same time, Sanders wishes to contrast this to the double-consciousness dialect of Du Bois, at least as she understands it. For Sanders, \"exilic dialectics\" is \"hoped to represent a progressive step beyond the 'double-consciousness' described by W. E. B.

In his introduction, Du Bois wrote that in the 50 years since its publication, he occasionally had the inclination to revise the book but ultimately decided to leave it as it was, \"as a monument to what I thought and felt in 1903\". While he stuck by his decision, he wrote that in the new edition he had made \"less than a half-dozen alterations in word or phrase and then not to change my thoughts as previously set down but to avoid any possible misunderstanding today of what I meant to say yesterday.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

Historian and literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] and a team of readers performed a line-by-line comparison of the two editions during the 1980s and identified two more changes. All the changes are minor; the longest was to change \"nephews and poor whites and the Jews\" to \"poor relations and foreign immigrants\". In six of the nine changes, Du Bois changed references to Jews to refer to immigrants or foreigners. Two of the other changes also involved references to Jews.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brent Hayes |last=Edwards |authorlink= |chapter=Note on the Text |title=The Souls of Black Folk |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280678-9 |page=xxv }}</ref>\n\nDu Bois wrote to Aptheker in February 1953 about concerns he had with his references to Jews in the book:\n<blockquote>I have had a chance to read [''The Souls of Black Folk''] in part for the first time in years. I find in chapters VII, VII and IX, five incidental references to Jews. I recall that years ago, [[Jacob Schiff]] wrote me criticising these references and that I denied any thought of race or religious prejudice and promised to go over the passages in future editions. These editions succeeded each other without any consultation with me, and evidently the matter slipped out of my mind.<br>As I re-read these words today, I see that harm might come if they were allowed to stand as they are. First of all, I am not at all sure that the foreign exploiters to whom I referred ... were in fact Jews.... But even if they were, what I was condemning was the exploitation and not the race nor religion. And I did not, when writing, realize that by stressing the name of the group instead of what some members of the [group] may have done, I was unjustly maligning a people in exactly the same way my folk were then and are now falsely accused.<br>In view of this and because of the even greater danger of injustice now than then, I want in the event of re-publication [to] change those passages.<ref>{{cite letter |first=W.

This at the time I stoutly denied; but as I read the passages again in the light of subsequent history, I see how I laid myself open to this possible misapprehension. What, of course, I meant to condemn was the exploitation of black labor and that it was in this country and at that time in part a matter of immigrant Jews, was incidental and not essential. My inner sympathy with the Jewish people was expressed better in the last paragraph of page 152. But this illustrates how easily one slips into unconscious condemnation of a whole group.<ref>{{cite letter |first=W. E.

This gambit failed when Seitz unexpectedly withdrew his support, and the preselection was instead won by [[Marlene Kairouz]].

This gambit failed when Seitz unexpectedly withdrew his support, and the preselection was instead won by [[Marlene Kairouz]]. The Ombudsman found that Suleyman then attempted to cancel funding for the project associated with Seitz, a move that would have cost the council more than $300,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/west/former-brimbank-mayor-natalie-suleyman-wins-labor-party-preselection-in-st-albans/news-story/1b40819a14ab04b70ce25800cf24a33a|title=Suleyman preselected in St Albans|date=2014-01-13|website=www.heraldsun.com.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThese events led to Seitz invoking [[Parliamentary privilege]] to criticise Suleyman on the floor of the Victorian Parliament.

He became a member of parliament, a Cabinet Minister of Transport in 1964, the [[Deputy Speaker]] of Parliament from 1994-2000 and a diplomat. He authored several books and edited newspapers and magazines. He was chairman and general manager of a State corporation. He briefly held the honorary rank of [[Colonel]].\n\n==Background and education==\nMoonesinghe was born in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka (then called [[Ceylon]]), on 15 February 1927. A member of the family of [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (who named him 'Anil Kumar'), he was brought up with [[Buddhist]] and [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalist values, as well as an abhorrence of the colonial power, [[British Empire|Britain]].\n\nHe went to school at [[Royal College, Colombo]], an elite institution which produced many [[Extremism|radicals]] as well as civil servants and [[bourgeois]] politicians, where he won his colours in [[Sports|athletics]]. During the [[Second World War]] he organised a brigade of boys to aid the Japanese if they landed on the island and earned himself the nickname '[[Rommel]]' at school. Later he became influenced by communism (he wrote in praise of the [[Red Air Force]]) and specifically by Trotskyism.\n\nHe went on to [[University College Ceylon]] (which later became [[University of Ceylon]]), where he excelled in athletics, representing his University at the All India Universities Athletic Meet, which was held regularly in those years, in [[Lahore]] in 1944. He taught briefly at [[Royal Preparatory School|Royal Primary School]], which had been evacuated to Glendale Bungalow, [[Bandarawela]]. He won an exhibition to the [[University of London]] and went to Britain in 1945. He sailed on board a [[troopship]]; when the news of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s defeat at the general election came through, all the soldiers on board threw their caps in the air and cheered, a fact which greatly encouraged him.\n\n==Revolutionary Communist Party==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Jeanne1958.jpg|thumb|left|Jeanne Hoban in 1958|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 21 March 2009}}]] -->\nAt [[University College, London]], he studied law. There he met his future wife, [[Jeanne Hoban]] \u2013 a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) whom he converted to Trotskyism \u2013 and [[Stan Newens]], who was later to become a [[Co-operative Party|Labour & Co-op]] MP. They joined the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1944)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP), in which they were associated with the group around [[Tony Cliff]], the so-called 'State-Caps' after their characterisation of the USSR as 'State-Capitalist'. \nThe group later became the Socialist Review Group (SRG), organised around the [[Socialist Review]] which evolved into the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). Both Anil and Jeanne were present at the founding conference of the SRG.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Birchall|first1=Ian |title=A socialist diamond jubilee|url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/351/socialist-diamond-jubilee |website=Socialist Review|publisher=socialistreview.org.uk|accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref>\nThrough the group he got to know [[Max Shachtman]], becoming familiar with his theory of 'bureaucratic revolution'. He was also familiar with [[Jock Haston]] and [[Ted Grant]]. Within the RCP he went by the Pseudonym 'Anil Kumaran'.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Plant |first1=John |title=Marking the death of Cyril Smith |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-cyril/obituary.htm |website=Marxists Internet Archive |publisher=marxists.org |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nFor a time he worked as an overhead crane operator at Southern Forge Ltd, [[Langley, Slough]]. He married Jeanne Hoban in 1948 and they moved into a houseboat called 'Red October', which they built together, on the Thames near Marlow. They both entered the Labour Party in [[Slough]], on the heels of a group of the RCP, led by Jock Haston. Anil was a speaker for the National Council of Labour Colleges; while Jeanne was elected to the Executive of the [[Labour Leagues of Youth]], later being put on the list of Labour Parliamentary candidates. They were both associated with the MP for Slough [[Fenner Brockway]] and with [[George Padmore]], the prophet of Black African Liberation.\n\n==LSSP Days==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anil Agalawatte 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Anil Moonesinghe addresses a LSSP rally in Agalawatte 21 December 1958]] -->\nHis parents summoned Anil back to Colombo urgently in 1952. He was called to the Bar and practised law all over the island. He and Jeanne joined the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (LSSP) and worked in the [[Lanka Estate Workers' Union]] (LEWU), which organised labourers on the tea and rubber plantations. At the time the British were still very powerful on the island, in spite of Ceylon having obtained a form of independence in 1948. The British planters prevailed upon the government to [[deport]] Jeanne, but she went into hiding and the LSSP fought successfully to prevent the deportation.\n\nIn 1954 the LEWU sent him to the Mohomediya Estate in [[Agalawatte]], in the Pasdun Korale (county) to organise a strike there. He was so successful that the Agalawatte Local of the LSSP asked for him to be sent as the Party's parliamentary candidate for the constituency. At the time, the seat was held by the [[United National Party]] (UNP) with a comfortable majority (the plantation workers, who were a large minority of the electorate, were disenfranchised by the UNP Government in 1949). In 1956 he won the election for this seat in Parliament representing Agalawatte for 11 years. He worked hard for his constituency, building roads and schools through self-help and worked for the welfare of the poorest sections, particularly for the neglected so-called lower [[castes]].\n\nHe also successfully contested the working-class Dematagoda [[Ward (politics)|Ward]] of the [[Colombo Municipal Council]], but found that working in Agalawatte took up too much time for him to devote any to his ward work.\n\nTogether with Jeanne, he joined Sri Lanka's first [[co-operative]] housing scheme, the Gothatuwa Building Society, founded by Herbert Keuneman, [[Seneka Bibile]], 'Bonnie' Fernando and other members of the radical [[intelligentsia]]. This led to the foundation of the [[Welikadawatte]] housing estate, which attained some fame as an island of intellectual creativity.\n\nHe was elected to the Central Committee of the LSSP and then onto its Political Bureau ([[Politburo]]), a position he never lost until he left the party. In 1956 he spoke in Parliament condemning the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary]]. In 1960, [[Yugoslavia]] opened an embassy in Colombo, and he advised the new ambassador unofficially on how to operate in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1963 he went to Yugoslavia for an [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] conference. There he had an opportunity to view at close hand the operation of the [[Workers' Councils]]. He was deeply impressed by the level of open debate that he found at these councils, and this experience was to aid him in later years.\n\n===Cabinet Minister===\nAt the 1964 LSSP conference, he was aligned with Dr [[N.M. Perera]] on the question of whether or not to enter the [[Coalition Government]] of Mrs [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]. The Party did enter the Government and he became one of the first three Trotskyist cabinet ministers. He received the portfolio of Communications (Transport) and set to work to build up the country's transport resources. He established [[Employees' Councils]] to help run the [[Sri Lanka Government Railway|Ceylon Government Railway]] and the [[Ceylon Transport Board]] (CTB). He obtained a large parcel of land in the centre of Colombo for establishing a Central Bus Station (CBS) in close proximity to the main Fort Railway Station. The construction of the [[Bandaranaike International Airport|new International Airport]] at [[Katunayake]] (a former [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] base which had been taken over in 1957) was also started by him. He negotiated an agreement with the [[FIAT]] company to build buses in Sri Lanka. However, the Government was defeated shortly thereafter and he was unable to complete his work \u2013 the next government did not sign the agreement with FIAT.\n\n===Back in opposition===\nAt the next general election, at which the coalition was defeated, he held his Parliamentary seat. However, in 1967 he lost it on an election petition, although the LSSP retained the Agalawatte seat at the subsequent by-election. He was editor of the daily ''[[Janadina]]'' newspaper for a short while around this time.\n\nIn 1966, the police arrested several lower-ranking soldiers and civilians, implicated in an alleged attempted coup d'\u00e9tat, the so-called 'Lavatory Coup'. Several army officers, including the Army Commander Major General [[Richard Udugama]], were dismissed or suspended. Moonesinghe was lawyer for the 9th accused, Mayadunne, in the subsequent trial.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Magistrate's Court of Colombo |title=The Queen v. Rev. H.

He later wrote a book condemning the Soviet invasion which ousted [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]].\n\nHe succeeded Dr N.M. Perera as President of the redoubtable [[All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union]] (ACUMWU). He also set about organising the [[United Corporations and Mercantile Union]] (UCMU) which brought together workers in government corporations, and of which he was general secretary. He went around the country from factory to factory and built up a union of several tens of thousands of members. One of his lieutenants in this task was [[Vasudeva Nanayakkara]], who became an MP in 1970. At the 1970 General Election, the UCMU also sponsored the candidature of novice [[Mahinda Rajapakse]], who was the Chairman of its Vidyodaya University branch and who was later to become Prime Minister and then President of Sri Lanka.\n\n===CTB chairman===\nAfter the 1970 election, at which the [[United Front]] (UF) won a landslide victory, the workers at the CTB spontaneously established workers' committees and took over the running of the institution. They also asked for Anil Moonesinghe to be made chairman of the board. The new Government therefore appointed him chairman and general manager. Thus began the most successful years of the CTB as an institution.

To prove that eight buses could be serviced in a day, he once personally carried out eight vehicle services at the Central Workshops, Werahera.\n\nIn addition to the role in management of the Employees' Councils (which the workers' committees were transformed into after being properly constituted, with democratic elections supervised by the Elections Commission), commuter organisations were included in an advisory role. The services were expanded and measures were taken to improve efficiency, including rationalising bus types. The CTB started buying buses from the [[Isuzu]] Company of Japan, to offset any cartelisation by [[TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company|Tata]] and [[Ashok Leyland]], the main suppliers, and also purchased [[Ikarus Bus|Ikarus]] buses from Hungary. Several new bus stands and bus depots were established. A modern, multi-storied bus station was planned at the CBS, complete with hotel and cinema, but this would never be completed.\n\nMoonesinghe also took measures to build up local industry and the CTB became well equipped with foundries and workshops: the Central Workshop at Werahera became the largest in South Asia. The local modification of ticket machines was started after employees pointed out many unsuitable features, and a new workshop was acquired for this. In 1974 he started the assembly of bus chassis and prototypes of a locally manufactured bus and a car rolled out of Werahera.\n\nIn 1971, when the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] (JVP) staged an insurrection, he formed a 2,000-strong paramilitary body, the Hansa Regiment (of which he was honorary Colonel), from among the employees of the CTB to guard bus depots, bus stops and workshops. He also created 'CANTAB', a secret intelligence organisation, the agents of whom were employees of the CTB, which provided accurate reports of the strength and distribution of JVP units.\n\nAt this time he joined the editorial board of ''State'', a theoretical journal of the LSSP, published in three languages.\n\nIn 1975, Leslie Gunawardena and he were preparing the ground for a major shift in the management of the CTB, whereby Employees' Council representatives were to form half the board of directors. However, in September that year the UF broke up and the LSSP Ministers were removed, so Anil resigned from the CTB.\n\n===Back in opposition===\nHe was briefly employed at this time, by the Government of [[Guyana]], as a consultant on transport.\n\nHe contested the 1977 election for the [[Matugama]] constituency, which lay next to Agalawatte. He was narrowly beaten into third place by the sitting member of the SLFP. He became deputy secretary of the LSSP in 1978, having supported the group led by NM Perera at that year's conference. In 1980, he was arrested for his part in the General Strike, but later released without any charges being made. At this time he wrote a book on the repression of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] union in [[Poland]].\n\nAbout this time, he coined the term 'Casino Capitalism' to describe the economic set-up under the UNP regime.<ref>{{cite news |title=Respond firmly to crime |url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200103/20010327editorialreview.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=Daily News |date=27 March 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420140625/http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200103/20010327editorialreview.html |archivedate=20 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n==SLFP Days==\nHe split from the LSSP in 1982 over its refusal to go into coalition with Mrs [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]'s [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP), forming the [[Sri Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (SLSSP) with other breakaways. He supported [[Hector Kobbekaduwa]] at the Presidential Election of that year. In 1983 the SLSSP dissolved itself and he joined the SLFP and contested the Matugama seat at a by-election and won. He represented Matugama until 1989 and then was one of the MPs \u2013 under [[proportional representation]] \u2013 for the [[Kalutara District]] until 2000. During the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, he intervened to save several people from death. During the 'White Terror' of 1988\u201390, he was active in saving hundreds of suspects from summary execution \u2013 at one point having to threaten an Army commandant with attack.\n\nIn the early 1990s he was elected a vice-president of the SLFP and was part of a re-organisation drive led by [[Anura Bandaranaike]], DM Jayaratne, Berty Premalal Dissanayake and [[Mahinda Rajapakse]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Obeyesekere |first1=Upali |title=Long trek from Weeraketiya to President\u2019s House |url=http://www.lankaeverything.com/vinews/politics/20060306162525.php |accessdate=15 July 2018 |publisher=Lankaeverything.com |date=6 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090539/http://www.lankaeverything.com/vinews/politics/20060306162525.php |archivedate=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn opposition, he was the spokesperson for Transport (he was also President of the Sri Lanka National Transport Workers' Union) and, being acknowledged as the best man to take care of the public transport sector, was expected to receive that portfolio in the event of the SLFP returning to power. However, after the victory in 1994 of the [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]], the new Prime Minister, [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] did not care to revive the CTB and did not make Moonesinghe a Minister.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battling iron-eating rats in the CTB |url=http://www.island.lk/2008/09/04/editorial.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=The Island |date=4 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead, he became [[Deputy Speaker]] and Chairman of Committees of Parliament. Soon after this, he was elected President of the [[Mahabodhi Society]], a Buddhist Missionary organisation headquartered in Colombo.\n\nHe was disoriented by the rather [[Derogatory use of 'Byzantine'|Byzantine]] internal politics of the SLFP. In the LSSP debate was out open and was democratic, with matters being finally settled with a vote. His habit of speaking his mind, which had only irritated others in the LSSP, proved to be a liability in his new political home. After becoming Deputy Speaker, he grew close to Mrs Bandaranaike, who had herself been deserted by many of her closest allies. Her death affected him deeply.\n\n==Diplomat==\nIn 2000 he was appointed Sri Lanka's Ambassador to [[Austria]], the UN and accredited to the [[Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav republics]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. On 14 March 2002 he presented his credentials as the first Sri Lankan Ambassador to [[Croatia]]. He had a close relationship with [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], the President of the Czech Republic, due to his connections with the oppositional movement in Czechoslovakia since the Prague Spring.\n\nAfter the victory of the UNP at the general election of December 2001, he was recalled.\n\nHe died on 8 December 2002 in Colombo. He left four children, Janaki, Vinod, Previn and Priyanka, the last two by a second marriage to Joan de Zilva.\n\n==Publications==\n* [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/win/vol07/no06/indonesia.htm Kumaran, Anil (pseudonym), \"The Indonesian Movement\", ''Workers\u2019 International News'', January\u2013February 1949.]\n* Moonesinghe, Anil, ''Chekoslov\u00e6kiyava'', Janadina Publications, Colombo, 1968.\n* Moonesinghe, Anil, \"The Nature of the State\", ''State'', Colombo, 1975, No 1.\n* Moonesinghe, Anil, ''Polanthaya \u2013 1980'', Janadina Publications, Colombo, 1980.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sri Lankan Non Career Diplomats]]\n*[[List of political families in Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050309193921/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/09/pol01.html 'Anil Moonesinghe dies', ''Daily News'', 9 December 2002]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041228090906/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/12/06/fea04.html Anura Bandaranaike, 'Anil Moonesinghe: an appreciation', ''Daily News'', 6 December 2003]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034344/http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/08/fea01.htm Dinesh Gunawardena, 'Anil Moonesinghe \u2013 a political and managerial visionary', ''Daily News'', 8 December 2005]\n*[http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/gen3006.htm 'HEWAVITHARANA, (Wijeyaguneratne) Don Carolis \u2013 Family #3006', ''Sri Lankan Sinhalese Family Genealogy'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051210130125/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/02/15/fea05.html 'Memories of Anil Moonesinghe', ''Daily News'', 15 February 2003]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181524/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/12/10/imp05.asp Vasudeva Nanyakkara, 'Anil Moonesinghe', ''Sunday Observer'', 10 December 2007]\n*[http://sundaytimes.lk/960421/news3.html Roshan Peiris, 'Anil, 50 not out in politics: he misses the CTB', ''Sunday Times'', 21 April 1996]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171748/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/12/15/fea05.html Ajith Samaranayake, 'A Leftist to the last', ''Sunday Observer'', 15 December 2002]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050215035214/http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/12/08/fea04.html Nihal Seneviratne, 'Anil Kumar Moonesinghe: Stormy petrel of the Centre-Left', ''Daily News'', 8 December 2004]\n*[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2000/bio540.html 'New Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka Presents Credentials', ''UN Information Service, Vienna'', 4 October 2000]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110518213132/http://www.southasianmedia.net/profile/srilanka/srilanka_foreignrelations.cfm 'Sri Lanka: Foreign Affairs', ''South Asian Media Net'']\n*[http://www.island.lk/2008/09/04/editorial.html 'Battling iron-eating rats in the CTB', ''The Island'', 4 September 2008.]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081212020937/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/12/08/fea02.asp  A leader par excellence]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091213011029/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/12/08/fea04.asp Scott Direckze, 'Anil K.

He became a member of parliament, a Cabinet Minister of Transport in 1964, the [[Deputy Speaker]] of Parliament from 1994-2000 and a diplomat. He authored several books and edited newspapers and magazines. He was chairman and general manager of a State corporation. He briefly held the honorary rank of [[Colonel]].\n\n==Background and education==\nMoonesinghe was born in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka (then called [[Ceylon]]), on 15 February 1927. A member of the family of [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (who named him 'Anil Kumar'), he was brought up with [[Buddhist]] and [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalist values, as well as an abhorrence of the colonial power, [[British Empire|Britain]].\n\nHe went to school at [[Royal College, Colombo]], an elite institution which produced many [[Extremism|radicals]] as well as civil servants and [[bourgeois]] politicians, where he won his colours in [[Sports|athletics]]. During the [[Second World War]] he organised a brigade of boys to aid the Japanese if they landed on the island and earned himself the nickname '[[Rommel]]' at school. Later he became influenced by communism (he wrote in praise of the [[Red Air Force]]) and specifically by Trotskyism.\n\nHe went on to [[University College Ceylon]] (which later became [[University of Ceylon]]), where he excelled in athletics, representing his University at the All India Universities Athletic Meet, which was held regularly in those years, in [[Lahore]] in 1944. He taught briefly at [[Royal Preparatory School|Royal Primary School]], which had been evacuated to Glendale Bungalow, [[Bandarawela]]. He won an exhibition to the [[University of London]] and went to Britain in 1945. He sailed on board a [[troopship]]; when the news of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s defeat at the general election came through, all the soldiers on board threw their caps in the air and cheered, a fact which greatly encouraged him.\n\n==Revolutionary Communist Party==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Jeanne1958.jpg|thumb|left|Jeanne Hoban in 1958|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 21 March 2009}}]] -->\nAt [[University College, London]], he studied law. There he met his future wife, [[Jeanne Hoban]] \u2013 a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) whom he converted to Trotskyism \u2013 and [[Stan Newens]], who was later to become a [[Co-operative Party|Labour & Co-op]] MP. They joined the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1944)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP), in which they were associated with the group around [[Tony Cliff]], the so-called 'State-Caps' after their characterisation of the USSR as 'State-Capitalist'. \nThe group later became the Socialist Review Group (SRG), organised around the [[Socialist Review]] which evolved into the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP). Both Anil and Jeanne were present at the founding conference of the SRG.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Birchall|first1=Ian |title=A socialist diamond jubilee|url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/351/socialist-diamond-jubilee |website=Socialist Review|publisher=socialistreview.org.uk|accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref>\nThrough the group he got to know [[Max Shachtman]], becoming familiar with his theory of 'bureaucratic revolution'. He was also familiar with [[Jock Haston]] and [[Ted Grant]]. Within the RCP he went by the Pseudonym 'Anil Kumaran'.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Plant |first1=John |title=Marking the death of Cyril Smith |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-cyril/obituary.htm |website=Marxists Internet Archive |publisher=marxists.org |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nFor a time he worked as an overhead crane operator at Southern Forge Ltd, [[Langley, Slough]]. He married Jeanne Hoban in 1948 and they moved into a houseboat called 'Red October', which they built together, on the Thames near Marlow. They both entered the Labour Party in [[Slough]], on the heels of a group of the RCP, led by Jock Haston. Anil was a speaker for the National Council of Labour Colleges; while Jeanne was elected to the Executive of the [[Labour Leagues of Youth]], later being put on the list of Labour Parliamentary candidates. They were both associated with the MP for Slough [[Fenner Brockway]] and with [[George Padmore]], the prophet of Black African Liberation.\n\n==LSSP Days==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anil Agalawatte 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Anil Moonesinghe addresses a LSSP rally in Agalawatte 21 December 1958]] -->\nHis parents summoned Anil back to Colombo urgently in 1952. He was called to the Bar and practised law all over the island. He and Jeanne joined the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (LSSP) and worked in the [[Lanka Estate Workers' Union]] (LEWU), which organised labourers on the tea and rubber plantations. At the time the British were still very powerful on the island, in spite of Ceylon having obtained a form of independence in 1948. The British planters prevailed upon the government to [[deport]] Jeanne, but she went into hiding and the LSSP fought successfully to prevent the deportation.\n\nIn 1954 the LEWU sent him to the Mohomediya Estate in [[Agalawatte]], in the Pasdun Korale (county) to organise a strike there. He was so successful that the Agalawatte Local of the LSSP asked for him to be sent as the Party's parliamentary candidate for the constituency. At the time, the seat was held by the [[United National Party]] (UNP) with a comfortable majority (the plantation workers, who were a large minority of the electorate, were disenfranchised by the UNP Government in 1949). In 1956 he won the election for this seat in Parliament representing Agalawatte for 11 years. He worked hard for his constituency, building roads and schools through self-help and worked for the welfare of the poorest sections, particularly for the neglected so-called lower [[castes]].\n\nHe also successfully contested the working-class Dematagoda [[Ward (politics)|Ward]] of the [[Colombo Municipal Council]], but found that working in Agalawatte took up too much time for him to devote any to his ward work.\n\nTogether with Jeanne, he joined Sri Lanka's first [[co-operative]] housing scheme, the Gothatuwa Building Society, founded by Herbert Keuneman, [[Seneka Bibile]], 'Bonnie' Fernando and other members of the radical [[intelligentsia]]. This led to the foundation of the [[Welikadawatte]] housing estate, which attained some fame as an island of intellectual creativity.\n\nHe was elected to the Central Committee of the LSSP and then onto its Political Bureau ([[Politburo]]), a position he never lost until he left the party. In 1956 he spoke in Parliament condemning the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary]]. In 1960, [[Yugoslavia]] opened an embassy in Colombo, and he advised the new ambassador unofficially on how to operate in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1963 he went to Yugoslavia for an [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] conference. There he had an opportunity to view at close hand the operation of the [[Workers' Councils]]. He was deeply impressed by the level of open debate that he found at these councils, and this experience was to aid him in later years.\n\n===Cabinet Minister===\nAt the 1964 LSSP conference, he was aligned with Dr [[N.M. Perera]] on the question of whether or not to enter the [[Coalition Government]] of Mrs [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]. The Party did enter the Government and he became one of the first three Trotskyist cabinet ministers. He received the portfolio of Communications (Transport) and set to work to build up the country's transport resources. He established [[Employees' Councils]] to help run the [[Sri Lanka Government Railway|Ceylon Government Railway]] and the [[Ceylon Transport Board]] (CTB). He obtained a large parcel of land in the centre of Colombo for establishing a Central Bus Station (CBS) in close proximity to the main Fort Railway Station. The construction of the [[Bandaranaike International Airport|new International Airport]] at [[Katunayake]] (a former [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] base which had been taken over in 1957) was also started by him. He negotiated an agreement with the [[FIAT]] company to build buses in Sri Lanka. However, the Government was defeated shortly thereafter and he was unable to complete his work \u2013 the next government did not sign the agreement with FIAT.\n\n===Back in opposition===\nAt the next general election, at which the coalition was defeated, he held his Parliamentary seat. However, in 1967 he lost it on an election petition, although the LSSP retained the Agalawatte seat at the subsequent by-election. He was editor of the daily ''[[Janadina]]'' newspaper for a short while around this time.\n\nIn 1966, the police arrested several lower-ranking soldiers and civilians, implicated in an alleged attempted coup d'\u00e9tat, the so-called 'Lavatory Coup'. Several army officers, including the Army Commander Major General [[Richard Udugama]], were dismissed or suspended. Moonesinghe was lawyer for the 9th accused, Mayadunne, in the subsequent trial.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Magistrate's Court of Colombo |title=The Queen v. Rev. H.

He later wrote a book condemning the Soviet invasion which ousted [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]].\n\nHe succeeded Dr N.M. Perera as President of the redoubtable [[All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union]] (ACUMWU). He also set about organising the [[United Corporations and Mercantile Union]] (UCMU) which brought together workers in government corporations, and of which he was general secretary. He went around the country from factory to factory and built up a union of several tens of thousands of members. One of his lieutenants in this task was [[Vasudeva Nanayakkara]], who became an MP in 1970. At the 1970 General Election, the UCMU also sponsored the candidature of novice [[Mahinda Rajapakse]], who was the Chairman of its Vidyodaya University branch and who was later to become Prime Minister and then President of Sri Lanka.\n\n===CTB chairman===\nAfter the 1970 election, at which the [[United Front]] (UF) won a landslide victory, the workers at the CTB spontaneously established workers' committees and took over the running of the institution. They also asked for Anil Moonesinghe to be made chairman of the board. The new Government therefore appointed him chairman and general manager. Thus began the most successful years of the CTB as an institution. For the last two of the five years he was there, the CTB ran at a profit, while providing a service which was never previously or subsequently matched. In this he was aided by his Minister, [[Leslie Goonawardena]].\n\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Anil Thalangama Depot 1970.jpg|thumb|right|Anil Moonesinghe (at centre in white bush shirt) enters Thalangama depot shortly after being appointed chairman, CTB, June 1970]] -->\nSenior citizens still nostalgically refer to the CTB under Moonesinghe, which provided an efficient and disciplined service to the public.<ref>{{cite news |title=Resurrecting the CTB |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2005/03/27/editorial.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=The Sunday Observer |date=27 March 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204040201/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2005/03/27/editorial.html |archivedate=4 February 2012}}</ref> He would dress in a bush shirt and trousers and operate as a one-man flying squad to catch errant bus crews in the act, lying in wait in his metallic blue [[Volkswagen Variant]] or his [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] at places like Dematagoda Junction to prowl on them.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Edirisuriya |first1=Chandra |title=To mark landmark foreign participation in public transport in Sri Lanka : Annals of omnibus transport |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/18/fea08.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=Daily News |date=18 December 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034331/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/18/fea08.html |archivedate=4 February 2012}}</ref> Stories would abound (all untrue) of him being spotted disguised with a beard. To prove that eight buses could be serviced in a day, he once personally carried out eight vehicle services at the Central Workshops, Werahera.\n\nIn addition to the role in management of the Employees' Councils (which the workers' committees were transformed into after being properly constituted, with democratic elections supervised by the Elections Commission), commuter organisations were included in an advisory role. The services were expanded and measures were taken to improve efficiency, including rationalising bus types. The CTB started buying buses from the [[Isuzu]] Company of Japan, to offset any cartelisation by [[TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company|Tata]] and [[Ashok Leyland]], the main suppliers, and also purchased [[Ikarus Bus|Ikarus]] buses from Hungary. Several new bus stands and bus depots were established. A modern, multi-storied bus station was planned at the CBS, complete with hotel and cinema, but this would never be completed.\n\nMoonesinghe also took measures to build up local industry and the CTB became well equipped with foundries and workshops: the Central Workshop at Werahera became the largest in South Asia. The local modification of ticket machines was started after employees pointed out many unsuitable features, and a new workshop was acquired for this. In 1974 he started the assembly of bus chassis and prototypes of a locally manufactured bus and a car rolled out of Werahera.\n\nIn 1971, when the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] (JVP) staged an insurrection, he formed a 2,000-strong paramilitary body, the Hansa Regiment (of which he was honorary Colonel), from among the employees of the CTB to guard bus depots, bus stops and workshops. He also created 'CANTAB', a secret intelligence organisation, the agents of whom were employees of the CTB, which provided accurate reports of the strength and distribution of JVP units.\n\nAt this time he joined the editorial board of ''State'', a theoretical journal of the LSSP, published in three languages.\n\nIn 1975, Leslie Gunawardena and he were preparing the ground for a major shift in the management of the CTB, whereby Employees' Council representatives were to form half the board of directors. However, in September that year the UF broke up and the LSSP Ministers were removed, so Anil resigned from the CTB.\n\n===Back in opposition===\nHe was briefly employed at this time, by the Government of [[Guyana]], as a consultant on transport.\n\nHe contested the 1977 election for the [[Matugama]] constituency, which lay next to Agalawatte. He was narrowly beaten into third place by the sitting member of the SLFP. He became deputy secretary of the LSSP in 1978, having supported the group led by NM Perera at that year's conference. In 1980, he was arrested for his part in the General Strike, but later released without any charges being made. At this time he wrote a book on the repression of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] union in [[Poland]].\n\nAbout this time, he coined the term 'Casino Capitalism' to describe the economic set-up under the UNP regime.<ref>{{cite news |title=Respond firmly to crime |url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200103/20010327editorialreview.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=Daily News |date=27 March 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420140625/http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200103/20010327editorialreview.html |archivedate=20 April 2005}}</ref>\n\n==SLFP Days==\nHe split from the LSSP in 1982 over its refusal to go into coalition with Mrs [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]'s [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP), forming the [[Sri Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (SLSSP) with other breakaways. He supported [[Hector Kobbekaduwa]] at the Presidential Election of that year. In 1983 the SLSSP dissolved itself and he joined the SLFP and contested the Matugama seat at a by-election and won. He represented Matugama until 1989 and then was one of the MPs \u2013 under [[proportional representation]] \u2013 for the [[Kalutara District]] until 2000. During the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, he intervened to save several people from death. During the 'White Terror' of 1988\u201390, he was active in saving hundreds of suspects from summary execution \u2013 at one point having to threaten an Army commandant with attack.\n\nIn the early 1990s he was elected a vice-president of the SLFP and was part of a re-organisation drive led by [[Anura Bandaranaike]], DM Jayaratne, Berty Premalal Dissanayake and [[Mahinda Rajapakse]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Obeyesekere |first1=Upali |title=Long trek from Weeraketiya to President\u2019s House |url=http://www.lankaeverything.com/vinews/politics/20060306162525.php |accessdate=15 July 2018 |publisher=Lankaeverything.com |date=6 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090539/http://www.lankaeverything.com/vinews/politics/20060306162525.php |archivedate=28 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn opposition, he was the spokesperson for Transport (he was also President of the Sri Lanka National Transport Workers' Union) and, being acknowledged as the best man to take care of the public transport sector, was expected to receive that portfolio in the event of the SLFP returning to power. However, after the victory in 1994 of the [[People's Alliance (Sri Lanka)|People's Alliance]], the new Prime Minister, [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] did not care to revive the CTB and did not make Moonesinghe a Minister.<ref>{{cite news |title=Battling iron-eating rats in the CTB |url=http://www.island.lk/2008/09/04/editorial.html |accessdate=15 July 2018 |agency=The Island |date=4 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead, he became [[Deputy Speaker]] and Chairman of Committees of Parliament. Soon after this, he was elected President of the [[Mahabodhi Society]], a Buddhist Missionary organisation headquartered in Colombo.\n\nHe was disoriented by the rather [[Derogatory use of 'Byzantine'|Byzantine]] internal politics of the SLFP. In the LSSP debate was out open and was democratic, with matters being finally settled with a vote. His habit of speaking his mind, which had only irritated others in the LSSP, proved to be a liability in his new political home. After becoming Deputy Speaker, he grew close to Mrs Bandaranaike, who had herself been deserted by many of her closest allies. Her death affected him deeply.\n\n==Diplomat==\nIn 2000 he was appointed Sri Lanka's Ambassador to [[Austria]], the UN and accredited to the [[Yugoslavia|former Yugoslav republics]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. On 14 March 2002 he presented his credentials as the first Sri Lankan Ambassador to [[Croatia]]. He had a close relationship with [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], the President of the Czech Republic, due to his connections with the oppositional movement in Czechoslovakia since the Prague Spring.\n\nAfter the victory of the UNP at the general election of December 2001, he was recalled.\n\nHe died on 8 December 2002 in Colombo. He left four children, Janaki, Vinod, Previn and Priyanka, the last two by a second marriage to Joan de Zilva.\n\n==Publications==\n* [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/win/vol07/no06/indonesia.htm Kumaran, Anil (pseudonym), \"The Indonesian Movement\", ''Workers\u2019 International News'', January\u2013February 1949.]\n* Moonesinghe, Anil, ''Chekoslov\u00e6kiyava'', Janadina Publications, Colombo, 1968.\n* Moonesinghe, Anil, \"The Nature of the State\", ''State'', Colombo, 1975, No 1.\n* Moonesinghe, Anil, ''Polanthaya \u2013 1980'', Janadina Publications, Colombo, 1980.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sri Lankan Non Career Diplomats]]\n*[[List of political families in Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050309193921/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/12/09/pol01.html 'Anil Moonesinghe dies', ''Daily News'', 9 December 2002]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041228090906/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/12/06/fea04.html Anura Bandaranaike, 'Anil Moonesinghe: an appreciation', ''Daily News'', 6 December 2003]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034344/http://www.dailynews.lk/2005/12/08/fea01.htm Dinesh Gunawardena, 'Anil Moonesinghe \u2013 a political and managerial visionary', ''Daily News'', 8 December 2005]\n*[http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/gen3006.htm 'HEWAVITHARANA, (Wijeyaguneratne) Don Carolis \u2013 Family #3006', ''Sri Lankan Sinhalese Family Genealogy'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051210130125/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/02/15/fea05.html 'Memories of Anil Moonesinghe', ''Daily News'', 15 February 2003]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181524/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2006/12/10/imp05.asp Vasudeva Nanyakkara, 'Anil Moonesinghe', ''Sunday Observer'', 10 December 2007]\n*[http://sundaytimes.lk/960421/news3.html Roshan Peiris, 'Anil, 50 not out in politics: he misses the CTB', ''Sunday Times'', 21 April 1996]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171748/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2002/12/15/fea05.html Ajith Samaranayake, 'A Leftist to the last', ''Sunday Observer'', 15 December 2002]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050215035214/http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/12/08/fea04.html Nihal Seneviratne, 'Anil Kumar Moonesinghe: Stormy petrel of the Centre-Left', ''Daily News'', 8 December 2004]\n*[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2000/bio540.html 'New Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka Presents Credentials', ''UN Information Service, Vienna'', 4 October 2000]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110518213132/http://www.southasianmedia.net/profile/srilanka/srilanka_foreignrelations.cfm 'Sri Lanka: Foreign Affairs', ''South Asian Media Net'']\n*[http://www.island.lk/2008/09/04/editorial.html 'Battling iron-eating rats in the CTB', ''The Island'', 4 September 2008.]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081212020937/http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/12/08/fea02.asp  A leader par excellence]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091213011029/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/12/08/fea04.asp Scott Direckze, 'Anil K.
