This roughly corresponds with the official United States military [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] Rhineland and Ardennes-Alsace campaigns.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Cobra Coutances.jpg|thumb|left|M4 and M4A3 [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] and infantrymen of the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 4th Armored Division]] advancing through Coutances.]]\n\nGerman forces had been routed during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Operation Cobra|break-out from Normandy]]. The Allies advanced rapidly against an enemy that put up little resistance. But after the [[liberation of Paris]] in late August 1944, the Allies paused to re-group and organise before continuing their advance from Paris to the [[Rhine|River Rhine]]. The pause allowed the Germans to solidify their lines\u2014something they had been unable to do west of Paris.\n\nBy the middle of September 1944, the three Western Allied [[army group]]s; the Anglo-Canadian [[21st Army Group]] ([[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]]) in the north, the United States [[Twelfth United States Army Group|U.S. 12th Army Group]] ([[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]]) in the center, and  the Franco-American [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]] (Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]]) in the south, formed a broad front under the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and his headquarters SHAEF ([[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]]).\n\nWhile Montgomery and Bradley each favored relatively direct thrusts into [[Germany]] (with Montgomery and Bradley each offering to be the spearhead of such an assault), General Eisenhower disagreed. Instead, he chose a \"broad-front\" strategy, which allowed the Allies to gain ground from the beaten Germans in all sectors, allowed the advancing Allied forces to support each other, and minimized the difficulty of supplying the most advanced forces.\n\nThe rapid advance through France had caused considerable logistical strain, made worse by the lack of any major port other than the relatively distant [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in western France. Although [[Antwerp]] was seen as the key to solving the Allied logistics problems, its port was not open to Allied shipping until the [[Scheldt]] estuary was clear of German forces. As the campaign progressed, all the belligerents, Allied as well as German, felt the effects of the lack of suitable replacements for front-line troops.\n\nThere were two major defensive obstacles to the Allies. The first was the natural barriers made by the rivers of eastern France. The second was the [[Siegfried Line]], which fell under the command, along with all ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' forces in the west, of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].\n\n===Logistics and supply===\nAlthough the breakout from Normandy had taken longer than planned, the advances until September had far exceeded expectations. Bradley, for example, by September had four more divisions than planned and all of his forces were {{convert|150|mi|km}} ahead of their expected position. One effect was that insufficient supplies could be delivered to the various fronts to maintain the advance: demand had exceeded the expected needs.\n\n[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|Mulberry 'A' off [[Omaha Beach]] was critical in the early days for Allied supplies.]]\n\nMuch war material still had to be brought ashore across the invasion beaches and through the one remaining [[Mulberry harbour]] (the other had been destroyed in an [[English Channel]] storm). Although small harbours, such as [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]], [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]], and [[Courcelles, Charente-Maritime|Courcelles]], were being used, the major forward ports such as [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Le Havre]] either remained in German hands as \"fortresses\" or had been systematically destroyed. The availability of Cherbourg had been valuable until the breakout, but then the shortage of transport to carry supplies to the rapidly advancing armies became the limiting factor.\n\nAlthough fuel was successfully pumped from Britain to Normandy via the [[Operation Pluto|Pluto]] pipeline, this still had to reach the fronts, which were advancing faster than the pipelines could be extended.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, pp. 501-502</ref>  The railways had been largely destroyed by Allied attacks and would take much effort to repair, so fleets of trucks were needed in the interim.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, pp. 547-51</ref> In an attempt to address this acute shortage of transport, three newly arrived U.S. infantry divisions\u2014the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[95th Infantry Division (United States)|95th]], and [[104th Infantry Division (United States)|104th]]\u2014were stripped of their trucks in order to haul supplies.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. II, p. 170</ref> Advancing divisions of the U.S. 12th Army Group left all their heavy artillery and half their medium artillery west of the [[Seine]], freeing their trucks to move supplies for other units.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, p. 487</ref>  Four British truck companies were loaned to the Americans.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, p. 484</ref> Unfortunately, 1,500 other British trucks were found to have critical engine faults and were unusable, limiting assistance from that quarter.<ref>''Administrative History of the Operations of 21 Army Group'', p. 47</ref> The [[Red Ball Express]] was an attempt to expedite deliveries by truck but capacity was inadequate for the circumstances.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, pp. 520</ref>\n\nThe 6th Army Group [[Operation Dragoon|advancing from southern France]] were supplied adequately from [[Toulon]] and [[Marseille]] because it had captured ports intact and the local railway system was less damaged. This source supplied about 25% of the Allied needs.\n\nAt this time the main Allied supply lines still ran back to Normandy, presenting serious logistical problems. The solution was to open the port of Antwerp. This major port had been captured at 90% intact on 4 September, but the occupation of Antwerp was not enough as the 21st Army Group failed to gain sea access by clearing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. So the port could not be used until 29 November after a protracted campaign by the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian First Army]]; initially the estuary was weakly held, but the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 15th Army]] was allowed to dig in there. \n\nThe delay in securing this area has been blamed on General Eisenhower as the 21st Army Group commander, Field Marshal Montgomery favored [[Operation Market-Garden]] and opening the French Channel ports over clearing the approaches to the port of Antwerp in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]].\n\n===Manpower===\nThe German armies had lost large numbers of troops in Normandy and the subsequent pursuit. To counteract this, about 20,000 ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' personnel were reallocated to the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], invalided troops were redrafted into the front line and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units were formed using barely trained civilians.\n\nBritish manpower resources were limited after five years of war and through worldwide commitments. Replacements were no longer adequate to cover losses and some formations were disbanded to maintain the strength of others. The Canadians were also short of manpower, due to a reluctance to require conscripts to serve outside Canada or Canadian waters. This had arisen from internal Canadian political difficulties during [[World War I]] and there had been a wide consensus against conscription for overseas service.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stacey|first=Colonel C.P.|authorlink=C.P.

They were often inexperienced and not used to the harsh conditions of the latter part of the campaign. There were also complaints about the poor quality of troops released into the infantry from less-stressed parts of the U.S. Army. At one point, after the Battle of the Bulge had highlighted the shortage of infantrymen, the army relaxed its embargo on the use of [[Buffalo soldiers|black soldiers]] in combat formations.<ref>{{cite web|title=African American Volunteers as Infantry Replacements|work=|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|date=October 2003|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/topics/afam/aa-volinfreps.html|doi=|accessdate=4 October 2007}}</ref> Black volunteers performed well and prompted a permanent change in military policy.\n\nBy the beginning of the next year, the war's outcome was clear. It became increasingly difficult to persuade Allied troops to risk their lives when peace was in sight. No one wished to be the last man killed.\n\n==Northern Group of Armies (21st Army Group)==\n===Channel ports===\n{{Main|Clearing the Channel Coast|Operation Astonia|Operation Fusilade|Operation Wellhit|Operation Undergo|Siege of Dunkirk (1944)}}\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B9743.jpg|thumb|left|British infantry of the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|Hampshire Regiment]] crossing the Seine at [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]], 28 August 1944.]]\n\nThe [[Channel ports]] were urgently needed to maintain the Allied armies. By the time that [[Brussels]] was liberated, it had become difficult to supply the 21st Army Group adequately. Indeed, one corps\u2014[[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]]\u2014was withdrawn from active service to free its transport for general use. The Canadian First Army was tasked with liberating the ports during its advance along the French coast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stacey|title=Chapter XIII: Antwerp, Arnhem and Some Controversies, August\u2013September 1944.

[[Adolf Hitler]] had appreciated their strategic value. He issued a [[Fuehrer Order|F\u00fchrer Order]] declaring them to be \"[[German World War II strongholds|fortresses]]\" that must receive adequate materiel for a siege and be held to the last man.\n\nDieppe was evacuated by the Germans before Hitler's order had been received and, consequently, the Canadians took it with little trouble and with the port installations largely intact. Ostend had been omitted from the F\u00fchrer Order and was also undefended, although demolitions delayed its use. The other ports were defended to varying degrees, however, and they required substantial work to bring them into use, except for Dunkirk which was sealed off to the rear of the Allied advance.\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU482.jpg|thumb|British vehicles enter [[Brussels]] on 4 September 1944]]\n\n===Market Garden===\n{{main|Operation Market Garden}}\n\nThe first operation of the [[Rhineland]] campaign, ''Market Garden'', was commanded by Montgomery and was to secure a bridgehead over the [[Rhine]] in the north, at [[Arnhem]], which would outflank the Siegfried Line.\n\n''Market Garden'' had two distinct parts. ''Market'' was to be the largest airborne operation in history, dropping three and a half divisions of American, British, and Polish paratroopers to capture key bridges and prevent their demolition by the Germans. ''Garden'' was a ground attack by the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] across the bridges. It was assumed that the German forces would still be recovering from the previous campaign and opposition would not be very stiff for either operation.\n\nIf successful, the Allies would have a direct route into Germany that bypassed the main German defenses and also seize territory from which the Germans launched [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1s]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2s]] against [[London]], Antwerp and elsewhere.\n\nGeneral Eisenhower approved ''Market Garden''. He gave supply priority to the 21st Army Group and diverted the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] to the north of the [[Ardennes]] to stage limited attacks to draw German defenders south, away from the target sites.\n\n[[File:Final briefing.jpg|thumb|American paratroopers receive a final briefing from their commanding officer before emplaning, 17 September 1944]]\nThe operation was launched on 17 September. At first, it went well. The U.S. [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] and [[82nd Airborne Division]]s took their objectives at [[Eindhoven]], [[Veghel]] and [[Nijmegen]]. Although their landings outside Arnhem were on target, the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]] landing zones were some distance from Arnhem bridge and only on the north side of the river. Problems arose when the British 1st Airborne Division lost vital equipment\u2014jeeps and heavy anti-tank guns\u2014when gliders crashed. There had also been a severe underestimation of German strength in the area. To make matters worse, poor weather prevented aerial reinforcements and drastically reduced resupply. German resistance to the forces driving to Arnhem was highly effective, and a copy of the Allied battle plan had been captured.\n\nIn the end, ''Market Garden'' was unsuccessful. Arnhem bridge was not held and the British paratroops suffered tremendous casualties\u2014approximately 77% by 25 September.\n\n===Battle of the Scheldt===\n{{main|Battle of the Scheldt|Operation Pheasant}}\n\nThe logistics situation was becoming critical, so opening the [[Port of Antwerp]] was now a high priority. On 12 September 1944, the Canadian First Army was given the task of clearing the [[Scheldt]] of German forces. The 1st Army comprised the [[II Canadian Corps]], which included the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Armoured Division]], the British [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division|49th]] and [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division|52nd Division]]s and the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|British I Corps]].\n\nThe task involved four main operations: The first was to clear the area north of Antwerp and secure access to [[South Beveland]]. The second was to clear the [[Breskens]] pocket north of the [[Leopold Canal (Belgium)|Leopold Canal]] ([[Operation Switchback]]). The third\u2014[[Operation Vitality]]\u2014was the capture of South Beveland. The final phase was the capture of [[Walcheren]] Island, which had been fortified into a powerful German stronghold.\n\nOn 21 September 1944, the advance began. The [[4th Canadian Division|4th Canadian Armoured Division]], moving north toward the south shore of the Scheldt around the Dutch town of Breskens, were the first Allied troops to face the formidable obstacle of the double line of the Leopold and D\u00e9rivation de la Lys Canals. The canals were crossed and a bridgehead established, but fierce counter-attacks by the Germans forced them to withdraw with heavy casualties. The 1st Polish Armoured Division had greater success, moving northeast to the coast, occupying [[Terneuzen]] and clearing the south bank of the Scheldt eastward to Antwerp. It was by then clear, however, that any further advances would be at tremendous cost.\n\n[[File:British Landings on Walcheren BU1255.jpg|thumb|British assault troops advancing near [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] with shells bursting ahead during the Scheldt operation.]]\n\nThe [[2nd Canadian Division|2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] began its advance north from Antwerp on 2 October. Heavy casualties ensued, including the almost total destruction of the [[5th Canadian Infantry Brigade]]'s [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada|Black Watch Battalion]] on 13 October. However, on 16 October [[Woensdrecht]] was taken, following an immense artillery barrage which forced the Germans back. This cut South Beveland and Walcheren off from the mainland and achieved the objective of the first operation.\n\nMontgomery issued a directive that made the opening of the Scheldt estuary the top priority. To the east, the British Second Army attacked westward to clear the Netherlands south of the [[Maas River]]. This helped secure the Scheldt region from counter-attack.\n\nIn Operation Switchback, the [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] mounted a two-pronged attack, with the [[7th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] crossing the Leopold Canal and the [[9th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] launching an amphibious assault from the coastal side of the pocket. Despite fierce resistance from the Germans, the [[10th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] crossed the Leopold Canal and the [[8th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] moved southwards, opening a supply route into the pocket.\n\n''Operation Vitality''\u2014the third major phase of the Battle of the Scheldt\u2014began on 24 October. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance toward South Beveland, but was slowed by mines, mud and strong enemy defences. The British 52nd Division made an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious attack]] to get in behind the Germans' Beveland Canal defensive positions. Thus, this formidable defence was outflanked, and the [[6th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] began a frontal attack in assault boats. The engineers were able to bridge the canal on the main road. With the canal line gone, the German defence crumbled and South Beveland was cleared. The third phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was now complete.\n\nThe final phase, Operation Infatuate was the attack on the heavily fortified island of Walcheren at the mouth of the West Scheldt. The island's dykes were breached by attacks from [[RAF Bomber Command]] on 3, 7, and 11 October. This flooded the central part of the island, forcing the German defenders onto the high ground and allowing the use of amphibious vehicles. Units of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the causeway on 31 October, and after a grim struggle, established a precarious foothold. They were relieved by a battalion of the British 52nd Division. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance.\n[[File:German POWs captured during the Allied assault on Walcheren Island in Holland, November 1944. BU1267.jpg|thumb|German prisoners on [[Walcheren]] \u2013 around 40,000 were taken after the [[Operation Infatuate]] had terminated]]\n\nThe amphibious landings began on 1 November with units of the British 155th Infantry Brigade landing on a beach in the south-eastern area of [[Vlissingen]]. During the next few days, they engaged in heavy street fighting against the German defenders. Also on 1 November, after a heavy naval bombardment by the British [[Royal Navy]], troops of [[4th Special Service Brigade|4th Commando Brigade]], (with units of 10th Inter Allied Commando, consisting mainly of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] troops), supported by specialised armoured vehicles of the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 79th Armoured Division]] were landed on both sides of the gap in the sea dyke. Heavy fighting ensued. A smaller force moved south-eastward, toward Vlissingen, while the main force went northeast to clear the northern half of Walcheren to link up with the Canadians who had established a bridgehead on the eastern part of the island. Fierce resistance was again offered by German troops defending the area, and fighting continued until 7 November. However, the action ended on 8 November after a force of amphibious vehicles entered [[Middelburg]], the capital of Walcheren.\n\nMeanwhile, Operation Pheasant was launched in on October 20 which was intended as a major operation to clear German troops from the Province of [[North Brabant]] in conjunction with the battle of the Scheldt. The offensive after some resistance liberated most of region; the cities of [[Tilburg]], [[s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] and [[Roosendaal]] were liberated by British forces. [[Bergen Op Zoom]] was taken by the Canadians and the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Armoured Division]] led by General [[Stanis\u0142aw Maczek|Maczek]] liberated the city of [[Breda]]. As a result, the German positions which had defended the region along its canals and rivers had been broken. The operation was also a success in that civilian casualties relatively light.\n\nMeanwhile, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had pushed eastwards past Bergen-op-Zoom to [[Sint Philipsland (island)|Sint Philipsland]] where it sank several German vessels in [[Zijpe]] harbour. With the approaches to Antwerp free, the fourth phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was complete; on 28 November, the first convoy entered the port.\n\n===''Veritable'' and ''Grenade''===\n{{main|Operation Veritable|Operation Grenade|Rhineland Offensive}}\n[[File:Kleve - Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Bomber Command C4964.jpg|thumb|[[Kleve]] was heavily bombed in February 1945]] \nMontgomery's 21st Army Group were tasked with clearing the west bank of the Rhine downstream from the [[Krefeld]] area. The approach was for the Canadian 1st Army\u2014strengthened by [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]]\u2014to advance south-eastward between the Rhine and Maas rivers while the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. Ninth Army]] advanced north eastwards from the [[Roer]]. The two armies would meet in the [[Geldern]] area. The British Second Army stayed west of the Maas, apart from two divisions that reinforced the Anglo-Canadian advance, but the German High Command were initially convinced that they were the principal threat and deployed their reserves in anticipation of an assault from [[Venlo]].\n\nThe two operations were delayed by the 'Battle of the Bulge' but they were rescheduled for 8 February 1945. Although the Anglo-Canadian attack ([[Operation Veritable]]) started on time, the US assault ([[Operation Grenade]]) was delayed by the threat and then the danger of flooding by water released from the Roer dams. This delay allowed the Germans to concentrate their defence on the Anglo-Canadian assaults, but they were unable to do much more than to slow it down in localised areas. When the Americans were able to advance, some two weeks later, there were few reserves left to face them and they made rapid progress until they encountered the German rearguard near the Rhine.\n\nThe two prongs met at Geldern, then pushed towards [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], finally expelling German forces on 21 March.\n\n==Central Group of Armies (12th Army Group)==\n\n===Aachen===\n{{main|Battle of Aachen}}\n[[File:Pursuit to the West Wall 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The advance of Allied forces between 26 August and 14 September 1944]]\n\nThe U.S. First Army was focused on capturing the city of [[Aachen]], which had to be dealt with before advancing to assault the Siegfried Line itself. Initially, the city of Aachen was to be bypassed and cut off in an attempt by the Allies to imitate the ''Blitzkrieg'' tactics the Germans had so effectively used (see below). However, the city was the first to be assaulted on German soil and so had huge historical and cultural significance for the German people. [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered that the garrison there be reinforced and the city held. This forced the Allied commanders to re-think their strategy.\n\nSome historians, including [[Stephen E. Ambrose]], have suggested that the siege of Aachen was a mistake. The battle stalled the eastward advance by the Allies and caused approximately 5,000 Allied casualties. The fighting was, by all accounts, brutal street-to-street, house-to-house style [[urban combat]] and tied up the available resources of the advancing Allied armies. Ambrose has suggested that a more effective strategy would have been to have isolated the garrison at Aachen and continue the move east into the heart of Germany. In theory, this would have eliminated the ability of the German garrison to operate as a fighting force by cutting off their supply lines. This might have forced them to surrender or to move out of the city in an attempt to re-establish their supply lines. In the case of the latter, a confrontation in a more neutral setting would probably have resulted in fewer military and civilian casualties.\n\n===Lorraine===\n{{main|Lorraine Campaign}}\n\nIn late August, the [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]] started to run low on fuel. This situation was caused by the rapid Allied advance through France, and compounded by the shift of logistical priority to the northern forces to secure Antwerp. By 1 September 1944, with the last of its fuel, the Third Army managed one final push to capture key bridges over the [[Meuse River]] at [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]] and [[Commercy]]. Five days after that, however, the critical supply situation effectively caused the Third Army to grind to a halt, allowing previously routed German forces to regroup and the reinforcement of their strongholds in the area.\n\nSoon after, the Third Army came up against [[Metz]], part of the [[Maginot Line]] and one of the most heavily fortified cities in Western Europe. The city could not be bypassed, as several of its forts had guns directed at Moselle crossing sites and the main roads in the area. It could also be used as a stronghold to organize a German counter-attack to the Third Army's rear. In the following [[Battle of Metz]], the Third Army, while victorious, took heavy casualties.\n\nFollowing Metz, the Third Army continued eastwards to the [[Saar (river)|Saar River]] and soon began their assault on the Siegfried Line.\n\n===H\u00fcrtgen Forest===\n{{main|Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28303, H\u00fcrtgenwald, schweres Infanteriegesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|German troops defending the H\u00fcrtgen in November 1944.]]\n\n[[H\u00fcrtgen Forest]] was seen as a possible location for incursions into the American flank, and the river dams in the area were a threat to the Allied advance downstream, so an assault to clear the area was started on 19 September 1944. German defence was more stubborn than expected and the terrain was highly favourable to defence, largely negating the American advantages of numbers and quality of troops. The battle\u2014expected to last a few weeks\u2014continued until February 1945 and cost 33,000 casualties (from all causes).\n\nThe value of the battle has been disputed. Modern historians argue that the outcome was not worth the foreseeable losses, and in any case, the American tactics played into German hands.<ref>Weigley (1981), pp. 364-369</ref>\n\n===Operation Queen===\n[[Operation Queen]] was a combined Allied air-ground offensive against the German forces at the Siegfried Line, which was conducted mainly by the combined effort of the U.S. Ninth and First Armies. The principal goal of the operation was to advance to the [[Roer]] River and to establish several bridgeheads over it, for a subsequent thrust into Germany to the Rhine River. Parts of this operation also included further fighting in the Hurtgen Forest. The offensive commenced on 16 November with one of the heaviest tactical air bombardments by the western Allies of the war. Although the German forces were heavily outnumbered, the Allied advance was very slow. After four weeks of intensive fighting, the Allies reached the Roer, but were not able to establish any bridgeheads over it. Fighting in the Hurtgen Forest also bogged down. The exhaustive fighting during ''Queen''  caused the Allied troops to suffer heavy casualties, and eventually the Germans launched their own counteroffensive\u2014Operation ''Wacht am Rhein''\u2014on 16 December, which would lead to the [[Battle of the Bulge]].\n\n==Winter counter-offensives==\n{{main|Battle of the Bulge|Operation Nordwind}}\n[[Image:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|275px|American soldiers taking up defensive positions in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge.]]\nThe Germans had been preparing a massive counter-attack in the West since the Allied breakout from Normandy. The plan called ''Wacht am Rhein'' (\"Watch on the Rhine\") was to attack through the [[Ardennes]] and swing North to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the U.S. First Army. After initial successes in bad weather, which gave the Germans cover from the Allied air forces, the Allies launched a counterattack to clear them from the Ardennes. The Germans were eventually pushed back to their starting points by 25 January 1945.\n\nThe Germans launched a second, smaller offensive (''[[Operation Nordwind|Nordwind]]'') into [[Alsace]] on 1 January 1945. Aiming to recapture Strasbourg, they attacked the 6th Army Group at multiple points. Because Allied lines had become severely stretched in response to the crisis in the Ardennes, holding and throwing back the ''Nordwind'' offensive was a costly affair that lasted almost four weeks. Allied counter-attacks restored the front line to the area of the German border and collapsed the Colmar Pocket.\n\n==Germany west of the Rhine {{anchor|Germany west of the Rhine}} <!-- Linked from [[list of battles by casualties#Major operations]] -->==\n{{main|Operation Veritable|Operation Grenade|Operation Lumberjack|Rhineland Offensive}}\nThe pincer movement of the Canadian First Army, advancing from the Nijmegen area in [[Operation Veritable]], and the U.S. Ninth Army, crossing the [[Roer]] in [[Operation Grenade]], was planned to start on 8 February 1945, but it was delayed by two weeks when the Germans flooded the Roer valley by destroying the floodgates of two dams on the upper Roer ([[Rur Dam]] and [[Urft Dam]]). During the two weeks that the little river was flooded, Hitler did not allow Rundstedt to withdraw German forces behind the Rhine, arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. Hitler ordered him to fight where his forces stood.\n\nBy the time the water had subsided and the U.S. Ninth Army was able to cross the Roer on 23 February, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine's west bank. The German divisions that had remained on the west bank of the Rhine were cut to pieces, and 280,000 men were taken prisoner. The stubborn German resistance had been costly; their total losses reached an estimated 400,000 men.<ref>Zaloga, Dennis p. 88</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Crossingtherhine.jpg|thumb|American soldiers crossing the Rhine river in assault boats]]\n\nThe Allies crossed the Rhine at four points. One crossing was an opportunity taken by U.S. forces when the Germans failed to blow up the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at [[Remagen]]; another was a hasty assault; and two crossings were planned:\n* The U.S. First Army aggressively pursued the disintegrating German troops, and on 7 March they [[Battle of Remagen|unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge across the Rhine River at Remagen]]. The [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] quickly expanded the bridgehead into a full scale crossing.\n* Bradley told General [[George S. Patton]]\u2014whose U.S. Third Army had been fighting through the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]\u2014to \"take the Rhine on the run\". The Third Army did just that on the night of 22/23 March, crossing the river with a hasty assault south of [[Mainz]] at [[Oppenheim]].\n* In the north, the Rhine is twice as wide, with a far higher volume of water than where the Americans crossed. Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, decided it could be crossed safely only with a carefully prepared attack. In [[Operation Plunder]] he crossed the Rhine at [[Rees, Germany|Rees]] and [[Wesel]] on the night of 23/24 March, including the largest single drop airborne operation in history, [[Operation Varsity]].\n* In the Allied 6th Army Group area, the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]] assaulted across the Rhine in the area between [[Mannheim]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on 26 March. A fifth crossing on a smaller scale was later achieved by the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]] at [[Speyer]].\n\nAfter crossing the Rhine, the Allies [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|rapidly advanced]] into Germany's heartland. The [[end of World War II in Europe]] followed soon after.\n\n==Notes==\n<small>\n<references group=note/>\n</small>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|first=Ted|last=Ballard|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/rhineland/rhineland.htm|title=Rhineland 15 September 1944-21 March 1945|series=CMH Online bookshelves: World War II Commemorative Brochures|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|location =Washington|year=c. 1990|id=CMH Pub 72-25}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Battle for the Rhine|first=Robin|last=Neillands|year=2005|publisher= Weidenfeld & Nicolson|isbn=978-0-297-84617-8}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Zaloga, Steve  |author2=Dennis, Peter|title=Remagen 1945: endgame against the Third Reich|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1-84603-249-0}}\n* {{cite book|first=Earl F.|last=Ziemke|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Occ-GY/index.htm#contents|title=The US Army in the Occupation of Germany 1944-1946|series=Army Historical Series|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|location=Washington| year=1990|id=CMH Pub 30-6|origyear=1975|chapter=ChapterX: The Rhineland Campaign|chapterurl= http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Occ-GY/ch10.htm}}\n* {{cite book|title=Eisenhower's Lieuitenants: The Campaign of France and Germany, 1944-1945|last= Weigley|first=Russell F.|authorlink=Russell Weigley|year=1981|publisher=Indiana Univ.

This roughly corresponds with the official United States military [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] Rhineland and Ardennes-Alsace campaigns.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Cobra Coutances.jpg|thumb|left|M4 and M4A3 [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] and infantrymen of the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 4th Armored Division]] advancing through Coutances.]]\n\nGerman forces had been routed during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Operation Cobra|break-out from Normandy]]. The Allies advanced rapidly against an enemy that put up little resistance. But after the [[liberation of Paris]] in late August 1944, the Allies paused to re-group and organise before continuing their advance from Paris to the [[Rhine|River Rhine]]. The pause allowed the Germans to solidify their lines\u2014something they had been unable to do west of Paris.\n\nBy the middle of September 1944, the three Western Allied [[army group]]s; the Anglo-Canadian [[21st Army Group]] ([[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]]) in the north, the United States [[Twelfth United States Army Group|U.S. 12th Army Group]] ([[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]]) in the center, and  the Franco-American [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]] (Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]]) in the south, formed a broad front under the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and his headquarters SHAEF ([[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]]).\n\nWhile Montgomery and Bradley each favored relatively direct thrusts into [[Germany]] (with Montgomery and Bradley each offering to be the spearhead of such an assault), General Eisenhower disagreed. Instead, he chose a \"broad-front\" strategy, which allowed the Allies to gain ground from the beaten Germans in all sectors, allowed the advancing Allied forces to support each other, and minimized the difficulty of supplying the most advanced forces.\n\nThe rapid advance through France had caused considerable logistical strain, made worse by the lack of any major port other than the relatively distant [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] in western France. Although [[Antwerp]] was seen as the key to solving the Allied logistics problems, its port was not open to Allied shipping until the [[Scheldt]] estuary was clear of German forces. As the campaign progressed, all the belligerents, Allied as well as German, felt the effects of the lack of suitable replacements for front-line troops.\n\nThere were two major defensive obstacles to the Allies. The first was the natural barriers made by the rivers of eastern France. The second was the [[Siegfried Line]], which fell under the command, along with all ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' forces in the west, of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].\n\n===Logistics and supply===\nAlthough the breakout from Normandy had taken longer than planned, the advances until September had far exceeded expectations. Bradley, for example, by September had four more divisions than planned and all of his forces were {{convert|150|mi|km}} ahead of their expected position. One effect was that insufficient supplies could be delivered to the various fronts to maintain the advance: demand had exceeded the expected needs.\n\n[[Image:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|Mulberry 'A' off [[Omaha Beach]] was critical in the early days for Allied supplies.]]\n\nMuch war material still had to be brought ashore across the invasion beaches and through the one remaining [[Mulberry harbour]] (the other had been destroyed in an [[English Channel]] storm). Although small harbours, such as [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]], [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]], and [[Courcelles, Charente-Maritime|Courcelles]], were being used, the major forward ports such as [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], [[Dunkirk]] and [[Le Havre]] either remained in German hands as \"fortresses\" or had been systematically destroyed. The availability of Cherbourg had been valuable until the breakout, but then the shortage of transport to carry supplies to the rapidly advancing armies became the limiting factor.\n\nAlthough fuel was successfully pumped from Britain to Normandy via the [[Operation Pluto|Pluto]] pipeline, this still had to reach the fronts, which were advancing faster than the pipelines could be extended.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, pp. 501-502</ref>  The railways had been largely destroyed by Allied attacks and would take much effort to repair, so fleets of trucks were needed in the interim.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, pp. 547-51</ref> In an attempt to address this acute shortage of transport, three newly arrived U.S. infantry divisions\u2014the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th]], [[95th Infantry Division (United States)|95th]], and [[104th Infantry Division (United States)|104th]]\u2014were stripped of their trucks in order to haul supplies.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. II, p. 170</ref> Advancing divisions of the U.S. 12th Army Group left all their heavy artillery and half their medium artillery west of the [[Seine]], freeing their trucks to move supplies for other units.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, p. 487</ref>  Four British truck companies were loaned to the Americans.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, p. 484</ref> Unfortunately, 1,500 other British trucks were found to have critical engine faults and were unusable, limiting assistance from that quarter.<ref>''Administrative History of the Operations of 21 Army Group'', p. 47</ref> The [[Red Ball Express]] was an attempt to expedite deliveries by truck but capacity was inadequate for the circumstances.<ref>Ruppenthal, ''Logistic Support of the Armies'', Vol. I, pp. 520</ref>\n\nThe 6th Army Group [[Operation Dragoon|advancing from southern France]] were supplied adequately from [[Toulon]] and [[Marseille]] because it had captured ports intact and the local railway system was less damaged. This source supplied about 25% of the Allied needs.\n\nAt this time the main Allied supply lines still ran back to Normandy, presenting serious logistical problems. The solution was to open the port of Antwerp. This major port had been captured at 90% intact on 4 September, but the occupation of Antwerp was not enough as the 21st Army Group failed to gain sea access by clearing the [[Scheldt]] estuary. So the port could not be used until 29 November after a protracted campaign by the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian First Army]]; initially the estuary was weakly held, but the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 15th Army]] was allowed to dig in there. \n\nThe delay in securing this area has been blamed on General Eisenhower as the 21st Army Group commander, Field Marshal Montgomery favored [[Operation Market-Garden]] and opening the French Channel ports over clearing the approaches to the port of Antwerp in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]].\n\n===Manpower===\nThe German armies had lost large numbers of troops in Normandy and the subsequent pursuit. To counteract this, about 20,000 ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' personnel were reallocated to the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], invalided troops were redrafted into the front line and ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units were formed using barely trained civilians.\n\nBritish manpower resources were limited after five years of war and through worldwide commitments. Replacements were no longer adequate to cover losses and some formations were disbanded to maintain the strength of others. The Canadians were also short of manpower, due to a reluctance to require conscripts to serve outside Canada or Canadian waters. This had arisen from internal Canadian political difficulties during [[World War I]] and there had been a wide consensus against conscription for overseas service.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stacey|first=Colonel C.P.|authorlink=C.P.

They were often inexperienced and not used to the harsh conditions of the latter part of the campaign. There were also complaints about the poor quality of troops released into the infantry from less-stressed parts of the U.S. Army. At one point, after the Battle of the Bulge had highlighted the shortage of infantrymen, the army relaxed its embargo on the use of [[Buffalo soldiers|black soldiers]] in combat formations.<ref>{{cite web|title=African American Volunteers as Infantry Replacements|work=|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|date=October 2003|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/topics/afam/aa-volinfreps.html|doi=|accessdate=4 October 2007}}</ref> Black volunteers performed well and prompted a permanent change in military policy.\n\nBy the beginning of the next year, the war's outcome was clear. It became increasingly difficult to persuade Allied troops to risk their lives when peace was in sight. No one wished to be the last man killed.\n\n==Northern Group of Armies (21st Army Group)==\n===Channel ports===\n{{Main|Clearing the Channel Coast|Operation Astonia|Operation Fusilade|Operation Wellhit|Operation Undergo|Siege of Dunkirk (1944)}}\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B9743.jpg|thumb|left|British infantry of the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|Hampshire Regiment]] crossing the Seine at [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]], 28 August 1944.]]\n\nThe [[Channel ports]] were urgently needed to maintain the Allied armies. By the time that [[Brussels]] was liberated, it had become difficult to supply the 21st Army Group adequately. Indeed, one corps\u2014[[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]]\u2014was withdrawn from active service to free its transport for general use. The Canadian First Army was tasked with liberating the ports during its advance along the French coast.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stacey|title=Chapter XIII: Antwerp, Arnhem and Some Controversies, August\u2013September 1944.

[[Adolf Hitler]] had appreciated their strategic value. He issued a [[Fuehrer Order|F\u00fchrer Order]] declaring them to be \"[[German World War II strongholds|fortresses]]\" that must receive adequate materiel for a siege and be held to the last man.\n\nDieppe was evacuated by the Germans before Hitler's order had been received and, consequently, the Canadians took it with little trouble and with the port installations largely intact. Ostend had been omitted from the F\u00fchrer Order and was also undefended, although demolitions delayed its use. The other ports were defended to varying degrees, however, and they required substantial work to bring them into use, except for Dunkirk which was sealed off to the rear of the Allied advance.\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU482.jpg|thumb|British vehicles enter [[Brussels]] on 4 September 1944]]\n\n===Market Garden===\n{{main|Operation Market Garden}}\n\nThe first operation of the [[Rhineland]] campaign, ''Market Garden'', was commanded by Montgomery and was to secure a bridgehead over the [[Rhine]] in the north, at [[Arnhem]], which would outflank the Siegfried Line.\n\n''Market Garden'' had two distinct parts. ''Market'' was to be the largest airborne operation in history, dropping three and a half divisions of American, British, and Polish paratroopers to capture key bridges and prevent their demolition by the Germans. ''Garden'' was a ground attack by the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] across the bridges. It was assumed that the German forces would still be recovering from the previous campaign and opposition would not be very stiff for either operation.\n\nIf successful, the Allies would have a direct route into Germany that bypassed the main German defenses and also seize territory from which the Germans launched [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1s]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2s]] against [[London]], Antwerp and elsewhere.\n\nGeneral Eisenhower approved ''Market Garden''. He gave supply priority to the 21st Army Group and diverted the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] to the north of the [[Ardennes]] to stage limited attacks to draw German defenders south, away from the target sites.\n\n[[File:Final briefing.jpg|thumb|American paratroopers receive a final briefing from their commanding officer before emplaning, 17 September 1944]]\nThe operation was launched on 17 September. At first, it went well. The U.S. [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] and [[82nd Airborne Division]]s took their objectives at [[Eindhoven]], [[Veghel]] and [[Nijmegen]]. Although their landings outside Arnhem were on target, the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]] landing zones were some distance from Arnhem bridge and only on the north side of the river. Problems arose when the British 1st Airborne Division lost vital equipment\u2014jeeps and heavy anti-tank guns\u2014when gliders crashed. There had also been a severe underestimation of German strength in the area. To make matters worse, poor weather prevented aerial reinforcements and drastically reduced resupply. German resistance to the forces driving to Arnhem was highly effective, and a copy of the Allied battle plan had been captured.\n\nIn the end, ''Market Garden'' was unsuccessful. Arnhem bridge was not held and the British paratroops suffered tremendous casualties\u2014approximately 77% by 25 September.\n\n===Battle of the Scheldt===\n{{main|Battle of the Scheldt|Operation Pheasant}}\n\nThe logistics situation was becoming critical, so opening the [[Port of Antwerp]] was now a high priority. On 12 September 1944, the Canadian First Army was given the task of clearing the [[Scheldt]] of German forces. The 1st Army comprised the [[II Canadian Corps]], which included the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Armoured Division]], the British [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division|49th]] and [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division|52nd Division]]s and the [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|British I Corps]].\n\nThe task involved four main operations: The first was to clear the area north of Antwerp and secure access to [[South Beveland]]. The second was to clear the [[Breskens]] pocket north of the [[Leopold Canal (Belgium)|Leopold Canal]] ([[Operation Switchback]]). The third\u2014[[Operation Vitality]]\u2014was the capture of South Beveland. The final phase was the capture of [[Walcheren]] Island, which had been fortified into a powerful German stronghold.\n\nOn 21 September 1944, the advance began. The [[4th Canadian Division|4th Canadian Armoured Division]], moving north toward the south shore of the Scheldt around the Dutch town of Breskens, were the first Allied troops to face the formidable obstacle of the double line of the Leopold and D\u00e9rivation de la Lys Canals. The canals were crossed and a bridgehead established, but fierce counter-attacks by the Germans forced them to withdraw with heavy casualties. The 1st Polish Armoured Division had greater success, moving northeast to the coast, occupying [[Terneuzen]] and clearing the south bank of the Scheldt eastward to Antwerp. It was by then clear, however, that any further advances would be at tremendous cost.\n\n[[File:British Landings on Walcheren BU1255.jpg|thumb|British assault troops advancing near [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] with shells bursting ahead during the Scheldt operation.]]\n\nThe [[2nd Canadian Division|2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] began its advance north from Antwerp on 2 October. Heavy casualties ensued, including the almost total destruction of the [[5th Canadian Infantry Brigade]]'s [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada|Black Watch Battalion]] on 13 October. However, on 16 October [[Woensdrecht]] was taken, following an immense artillery barrage which forced the Germans back. This cut South Beveland and Walcheren off from the mainland and achieved the objective of the first operation.\n\nMontgomery issued a directive that made the opening of the Scheldt estuary the top priority. To the east, the British Second Army attacked westward to clear the Netherlands south of the [[Maas River]]. This helped secure the Scheldt region from counter-attack.\n\nIn Operation Switchback, the [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] mounted a two-pronged attack, with the [[7th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] crossing the Leopold Canal and the [[9th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] launching an amphibious assault from the coastal side of the pocket. Despite fierce resistance from the Germans, the [[10th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] crossed the Leopold Canal and the [[8th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] moved southwards, opening a supply route into the pocket.\n\n''Operation Vitality''\u2014the third major phase of the Battle of the Scheldt\u2014began on 24 October. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance toward South Beveland, but was slowed by mines, mud and strong enemy defences. The British 52nd Division made an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious attack]] to get in behind the Germans' Beveland Canal defensive positions. Thus, this formidable defence was outflanked, and the [[6th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] began a frontal attack in assault boats. The engineers were able to bridge the canal on the main road. With the canal line gone, the German defence crumbled and South Beveland was cleared. The third phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was now complete.\n\nThe final phase, Operation Infatuate was the attack on the heavily fortified island of Walcheren at the mouth of the West Scheldt. The island's dykes were breached by attacks from [[RAF Bomber Command]] on 3, 7, and 11 October. This flooded the central part of the island, forcing the German defenders onto the high ground and allowing the use of amphibious vehicles. Units of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the causeway on 31 October, and after a grim struggle, established a precarious foothold. They were relieved by a battalion of the British 52nd Division. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance.\n[[File:German POWs captured during the Allied assault on Walcheren Island in Holland, November 1944. BU1267.jpg|thumb|German prisoners on [[Walcheren]] \u2013 around 40,000 were taken after the [[Operation Infatuate]] had terminated]]\n\nThe amphibious landings began on 1 November with units of the British 155th Infantry Brigade landing on a beach in the south-eastern area of [[Vlissingen]]. During the next few days, they engaged in heavy street fighting against the German defenders. Also on 1 November, after a heavy naval bombardment by the British [[Royal Navy]], troops of [[4th Special Service Brigade|4th Commando Brigade]], (with units of 10th Inter Allied Commando, consisting mainly of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] troops), supported by specialised armoured vehicles of the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 79th Armoured Division]] were landed on both sides of the gap in the sea dyke. Heavy fighting ensued. A smaller force moved south-eastward, toward Vlissingen, while the main force went northeast to clear the northern half of Walcheren to link up with the Canadians who had established a bridgehead on the eastern part of the island. Fierce resistance was again offered by German troops defending the area, and fighting continued until 7 November. However, the action ended on 8 November after a force of amphibious vehicles entered [[Middelburg]], the capital of Walcheren.\n\nMeanwhile, Operation Pheasant was launched in on October 20 which was intended as a major operation to clear German troops from the Province of [[North Brabant]] in conjunction with the battle of the Scheldt. The offensive after some resistance liberated most of region; the cities of [[Tilburg]], [[s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Willemstad, North Brabant|Willemstad]] and [[Roosendaal]] were liberated by British forces. [[Bergen Op Zoom]] was taken by the Canadians and the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|Polish 1st Armoured Division]] led by General [[Stanis\u0142aw Maczek|Maczek]] liberated the city of [[Breda]]. As a result, the German positions which had defended the region along its canals and rivers had been broken. The operation was also a success in that civilian casualties relatively light.\n\nMeanwhile, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had pushed eastwards past Bergen-op-Zoom to [[Sint Philipsland (island)|Sint Philipsland]] where it sank several German vessels in [[Zijpe]] harbour. With the approaches to Antwerp free, the fourth phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was complete; on 28 November, the first convoy entered the port.\n\n===''Veritable'' and ''Grenade''===\n{{main|Operation Veritable|Operation Grenade|Rhineland Offensive}}\n[[File:Kleve - Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Bomber Command C4964.jpg|thumb|[[Kleve]] was heavily bombed in February 1945]] \nMontgomery's 21st Army Group were tasked with clearing the west bank of the Rhine downstream from the [[Krefeld]] area. The approach was for the Canadian 1st Army\u2014strengthened by [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]]\u2014to advance south-eastward between the Rhine and Maas rivers while the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. Ninth Army]] advanced north eastwards from the [[Roer]]. The two armies would meet in the [[Geldern]] area. The British Second Army stayed west of the Maas, apart from two divisions that reinforced the Anglo-Canadian advance, but the German High Command were initially convinced that they were the principal threat and deployed their reserves in anticipation of an assault from [[Venlo]].\n\nThe two operations were delayed by the 'Battle of the Bulge' but they were rescheduled for 8 February 1945. Although the Anglo-Canadian attack ([[Operation Veritable]]) started on time, the US assault ([[Operation Grenade]]) was delayed by the threat and then the danger of flooding by water released from the Roer dams. This delay allowed the Germans to concentrate their defence on the Anglo-Canadian assaults, but they were unable to do much more than to slow it down in localised areas. When the Americans were able to advance, some two weeks later, there were few reserves left to face them and they made rapid progress until they encountered the German rearguard near the Rhine.\n\nThe two prongs met at Geldern, then pushed towards [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], finally expelling German forces on 21 March.\n\n==Central Group of Armies (12th Army Group)==\n\n===Aachen===\n{{main|Battle of Aachen}}\n[[File:Pursuit to the West Wall 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The advance of Allied forces between 26 August and 14 September 1944]]\n\nThe U.S. First Army was focused on capturing the city of [[Aachen]], which had to be dealt with before advancing to assault the Siegfried Line itself. Initially, the city of Aachen was to be bypassed and cut off in an attempt by the Allies to imitate the ''Blitzkrieg'' tactics the Germans had so effectively used (see below). However, the city was the first to be assaulted on German soil and so had huge historical and cultural significance for the German people. [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered that the garrison there be reinforced and the city held. This forced the Allied commanders to re-think their strategy.\n\nSome historians, including [[Stephen E. Ambrose]], have suggested that the siege of Aachen was a mistake. The battle stalled the eastward advance by the Allies and caused approximately 5,000 Allied casualties. The fighting was, by all accounts, brutal street-to-street, house-to-house style [[urban combat]] and tied up the available resources of the advancing Allied armies. Ambrose has suggested that a more effective strategy would have been to have isolated the garrison at Aachen and continue the move east into the heart of Germany. In theory, this would have eliminated the ability of the German garrison to operate as a fighting force by cutting off their supply lines. This might have forced them to surrender or to move out of the city in an attempt to re-establish their supply lines. In the case of the latter, a confrontation in a more neutral setting would probably have resulted in fewer military and civilian casualties.\n\n===Lorraine===\n{{main|Lorraine Campaign}}\n\nIn late August, the [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]] started to run low on fuel. This situation was caused by the rapid Allied advance through France, and compounded by the shift of logistical priority to the northern forces to secure Antwerp. By 1 September 1944, with the last of its fuel, the Third Army managed one final push to capture key bridges over the [[Meuse River]] at [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]] and [[Commercy]]. Five days after that, however, the critical supply situation effectively caused the Third Army to grind to a halt, allowing previously routed German forces to regroup and the reinforcement of their strongholds in the area.\n\nSoon after, the Third Army came up against [[Metz]], part of the [[Maginot Line]] and one of the most heavily fortified cities in Western Europe. The city could not be bypassed, as several of its forts had guns directed at Moselle crossing sites and the main roads in the area. It could also be used as a stronghold to organize a German counter-attack to the Third Army's rear. In the following [[Battle of Metz]], the Third Army, while victorious, took heavy casualties.\n\nFollowing Metz, the Third Army continued eastwards to the [[Saar (river)|Saar River]] and soon began their assault on the Siegfried Line.\n\n===H\u00fcrtgen Forest===\n{{main|Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28303, H\u00fcrtgenwald, schweres Infanteriegesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|German troops defending the H\u00fcrtgen in November 1944.]]\n\n[[H\u00fcrtgen Forest]] was seen as a possible location for incursions into the American flank, and the river dams in the area were a threat to the Allied advance downstream, so an assault to clear the area was started on 19 September 1944. German defence was more stubborn than expected and the terrain was highly favourable to defence, largely negating the American advantages of numbers and quality of troops. The battle\u2014expected to last a few weeks\u2014continued until February 1945 and cost 33,000 casualties (from all causes).\n\nThe value of the battle has been disputed. Modern historians argue that the outcome was not worth the foreseeable losses, and in any case, the American tactics played into German hands.<ref>Weigley (1981), pp. 364-369</ref>\n\n===Operation Queen===\n[[Operation Queen]] was a combined Allied air-ground offensive against the German forces at the Siegfried Line, which was conducted mainly by the combined effort of the U.S. Ninth and First Armies. The principal goal of the operation was to advance to the [[Roer]] River and to establish several bridgeheads over it, for a subsequent thrust into Germany to the Rhine River. Parts of this operation also included further fighting in the Hurtgen Forest. The offensive commenced on 16 November with one of the heaviest tactical air bombardments by the western Allies of the war. Although the German forces were heavily outnumbered, the Allied advance was very slow. After four weeks of intensive fighting, the Allies reached the Roer, but were not able to establish any bridgeheads over it. Fighting in the Hurtgen Forest also bogged down. The exhaustive fighting during ''Queen''  caused the Allied troops to suffer heavy casualties, and eventually the Germans launched their own counteroffensive\u2014Operation ''Wacht am Rhein''\u2014on 16 December, which would lead to the [[Battle of the Bulge]].\n\n==Winter counter-offensives==\n{{main|Battle of the Bulge|Operation Nordwind}}\n[[Image:Battle of the Bulge.jpg|thumb|275px|American soldiers taking up defensive positions in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge.]]\nThe Germans had been preparing a massive counter-attack in the West since the Allied breakout from Normandy. The plan called ''Wacht am Rhein'' (\"Watch on the Rhine\") was to attack through the [[Ardennes]] and swing North to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the U.S. First Army. After initial successes in bad weather, which gave the Germans cover from the Allied air forces, the Allies launched a counterattack to clear them from the Ardennes. The Germans were eventually pushed back to their starting points by 25 January 1945.\n\nThe Germans launched a second, smaller offensive (''[[Operation Nordwind|Nordwind]]'') into [[Alsace]] on 1 January 1945. Aiming to recapture Strasbourg, they attacked the 6th Army Group at multiple points. Because Allied lines had become severely stretched in response to the crisis in the Ardennes, holding and throwing back the ''Nordwind'' offensive was a costly affair that lasted almost four weeks. Allied counter-attacks restored the front line to the area of the German border and collapsed the Colmar Pocket.\n\n==Germany west of the Rhine {{anchor|Germany west of the Rhine}} <!-- Linked from [[list of battles by casualties#Major operations]] -->==\n{{main|Operation Veritable|Operation Grenade|Operation Lumberjack|Rhineland Offensive}}\nThe pincer movement of the Canadian First Army, advancing from the Nijmegen area in [[Operation Veritable]], and the U.S. Ninth Army, crossing the [[Roer]] in [[Operation Grenade]], was planned to start on 8 February 1945, but it was delayed by two weeks when the Germans flooded the Roer valley by destroying the floodgates of two dams on the upper Roer ([[Rur Dam]] and [[Urft Dam]]). During the two weeks that the little river was flooded, Hitler did not allow Rundstedt to withdraw German forces behind the Rhine, arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. Hitler ordered him to fight where his forces stood.\n\nBy the time the water had subsided and the U.S. Ninth Army was able to cross the Roer on 23 February, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine's west bank. The German divisions that had remained on the west bank of the Rhine were cut to pieces, and 280,000 men were taken prisoner. The stubborn German resistance had been costly; their total losses reached an estimated 400,000 men.<ref>Zaloga, Dennis p. 88</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Crossingtherhine.jpg|thumb|American soldiers crossing the Rhine river in assault boats]]\n\nThe Allies crossed the Rhine at four points. One crossing was an opportunity taken by U.S. forces when the Germans failed to blow up the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at [[Remagen]]; another was a hasty assault; and two crossings were planned:\n* The U.S. First Army aggressively pursued the disintegrating German troops, and on 7 March they [[Battle of Remagen|unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge across the Rhine River at Remagen]]. The [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] quickly expanded the bridgehead into a full scale crossing.\n* Bradley told General [[George S. Patton]]\u2014whose U.S. Third Army had been fighting through the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]\u2014to \"take the Rhine on the run\". The Third Army did just that on the night of 22/23 March, crossing the river with a hasty assault south of [[Mainz]] at [[Oppenheim]].\n* In the north, the Rhine is twice as wide, with a far higher volume of water than where the Americans crossed. Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, decided it could be crossed safely only with a carefully prepared attack. In [[Operation Plunder]] he crossed the Rhine at [[Rees, Germany|Rees]] and [[Wesel]] on the night of 23/24 March, including the largest single drop airborne operation in history, [[Operation Varsity]].\n* In the Allied 6th Army Group area, the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]] assaulted across the Rhine in the area between [[Mannheim]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on 26 March. A fifth crossing on a smaller scale was later achieved by the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]] at [[Speyer]].\n\nAfter crossing the Rhine, the Allies [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|rapidly advanced]] into Germany's heartland. The [[end of World War II in Europe]] followed soon after.\n\n==Notes==\n<small>\n<references group=note/>\n</small>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|first=Ted|last=Ballard|url=http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/rhineland/rhineland.htm|title=Rhineland 15 September 1944-21 March 1945|series=CMH Online bookshelves: World War II Commemorative Brochures|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|location =Washington|year=c. 1990|id=CMH Pub 72-25}}\n* {{cite book|title=The Battle for the Rhine|first=Robin|last=Neillands|year=2005|publisher= Weidenfeld & Nicolson|isbn=978-0-297-84617-8}}\n* {{cite book|author1=Zaloga, Steve  |author2=Dennis, Peter|title=Remagen 1945: endgame against the Third Reich|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1-84603-249-0}}\n* {{cite book|first=Earl F.|last=Ziemke|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Occ-GY/index.htm#contents|title=The US Army in the Occupation of Germany 1944-1946|series=Army Historical Series|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|location=Washington| year=1990|id=CMH Pub 30-6|origyear=1975|chapter=ChapterX: The Rhineland Campaign|chapterurl= http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Occ-GY/ch10.htm}}\n* {{cite book|title=Eisenhower's Lieuitenants: The Campaign of France and Germany, 1944-1945|last= Weigley|first=Russell F.|authorlink=Russell Weigley|year=1981|publisher=Indiana Univ.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the character who appeared in two theatrical ''Dr. Who'' films|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| number             = 156\n| serial_name        = Doctor Who: The Television Movie\n| show               = DW\n| type               = television film\n| image              = [[File:Doctor Who 1996 poster.jpg|230px]]\n| caption            = 1996 promotional poster\n| doctors            =\n* [[Paul McGann]] ([[Eighth Doctor]])\n*[[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n| companion          = [[Daphne Ashbrook]] ([[Grace Holloway]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Yee Jee Tso]] \u2013 Chang Lee\n*[[Eric Roberts]] \u2013 [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]\n*[[John Novak]] \u2013 Salinger\n*Michael David Simms \u2013 Dr. Swift\n*Eliza Roberts \u2013 Miranda\n*Dave Hurtubise \u2013 Professor Wagg\n*Dolores Drake \u2013 Curtis\n*Catherine Lough \u2013 Wheeler\n*[[Will Sasso|William Sasso]] \u2013 Pete\n*Joel Wirkkunen \u2013 Ted\n*Jeremy Radick \u2013 Gareth\n*Bill Croft \u2013 Motorcyclist Policeman\n*[[Mi-Jung Lee]] \u2013 News Anchor\n*Joanna Piros \u2013 News Anchor\n*Dee Jay Jackson \u2013 Security Man\n*Gordon Tipple \u2013 The Master on Trial\n| director           = [[Geoffrey Sax]]\n| writer             = [[Matthew Jacobs]]\n| script_editor      = None\n| producer           = Peter V.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCast notes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(film)"}

The video begins with Brandy watching an episode of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]].'' Next we see Monica who, using her remote, accidentally turns Brandy's TV along with her own to watch an old romantic movie. Confused, Brandy changes her channel back. Much to their dismay, whenever one of them turns the channel, the other's TV is also turned. They begin singing. The next scene shows the two discussing their problem among their separate groups of friends. The titular boy himself (played by [[Mekhi Phifer]]) then appears outside adjacent apartments, 6 & 7, where we later discover the two girls live; all their friends walk by him as they exit their respective friend's place. The girls are seen next arguing through their adjoining bedroom wall, until the boy phones them one after the other. They each overhear the other's conversation through the wall, realizing that they've both been played. They proceed to gather up all gifts and memorabilia related to the boy and toss them out the door. After Brandy and Monica sing more through the song's lyrics, the boy knocks on Brandy's door. The door opens showing Brandy for a brief moment before she opens the door wider to reveal Monica beside her. The boy is taken aback, and the door is slammed in his face.\n\nThe video, filmed in April 1998 and used 90-degree tilts to depict the drama and the playfulness between the two. It was nominated for two [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video|Best R&B Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], but lost to both [[Wyclef Jean]]'s \"[[Gone Till November]]\" and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" respectively.\n\n==Live performances==\nBrandy first performed the song by herself on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.

The video begins with Brandy watching an episode of ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]].'' Next we see Monica who, using her remote, accidentally turns Brandy's TV along with her own to watch an old romantic movie. Confused, Brandy changes her channel back. Much to their dismay, whenever one of them turns the channel, the other's TV is also turned. They begin singing. The next scene shows the two discussing their problem among their separate groups of friends. The titular boy himself (played by [[Mekhi Phifer]]) then appears outside adjacent apartments, 6 & 7, where we later discover the two girls live; all their friends walk by him as they exit their respective friend's place. The girls are seen next arguing through their adjoining bedroom wall, until the boy phones them one after the other. They each overhear the other's conversation through the wall, realizing that they've both been played. They proceed to gather up all gifts and memorabilia related to the boy and toss them out the door. After Brandy and Monica sing more through the song's lyrics, the boy knocks on Brandy's door. The door opens showing Brandy for a brief moment before she opens the door wider to reveal Monica beside her. The boy is taken aback, and the door is slammed in his face.\n\nThe video, filmed in April 1998 and used 90-degree tilts to depict the drama and the playfulness between the two. It was nominated for two [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video|Best R&B Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]], but lost to both [[Wyclef Jean]]'s \"[[Gone Till November]]\" and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" respectively.\n\n==Live performances==\nBrandy first performed the song by herself on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Following that, she and Monica first performed it together at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]] in [[Los Angeles]] at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] on September 10, 1998,<ref name=\"jet10051998\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39&dq=%22the+boy+is+mine%22+brandy&hl=de&ei=C6DkTZ3uNoXFswbRoJyQBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22the%20boy%20is%20mine%22%20brandy&f=false|title=Brandy And Monica's Managers Deny Alleged Fight Backstage At MTV's VIdeo Music Awards|work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|publisher=[[Google Books]]|date=1998-10-05|accessdate=2011-05-31}}</ref> an event which remains, to date, Brandy and Monica's only television broadcast performance of the song.

These predictions have come largely from bioinformatic strategies, involving modeling individual species, groups of species such as \u2018functional types\u2019, communities, ecosystems or biomes. They can also involve modeling species observed environmental [[ecological niche|niches]], or observed physiological processes.\n\nAlthough useful, modeling has many limitations. Firstly, there is uncertainty about the future levels of greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change <ref>Solomon, S., et al. (2007). Technical Summary. In \u2018Climate Change 2007: The\nPhysical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019. (Eds. S. Solomon, et al.) pp. 19-91, [[Cambridge University Press]]: Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA.\n</ref> and considerable uncertainty in [[Global climate model|modeling]] how this will affect other aspects of climate such as local rainfall or temperatures. For most species the importance of specific climatic variables in defining distribution (e.g. minimum rainfall or maximum temperature) is unknown.

This cascading event would be detrimental to our earth and how we view nature today.\n\n==Challenges of modeling future impacts==\nAccurate predictions of the future impacts of climate change on plant diversity are critical to the development of conservation strategies. These predictions have come largely from bioinformatic strategies, involving modeling individual species, groups of species such as \u2018functional types\u2019, communities, ecosystems or biomes. They can also involve modeling species observed environmental [[ecological niche|niches]], or observed physiological processes.\n\nAlthough useful, modeling has many limitations. Firstly, there is uncertainty about the future levels of greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change <ref>Solomon, S., et al. (2007). Technical Summary. In \u2018Climate Change 2007: The\nPhysical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019. (Eds. S. Solomon, et al.) pp. 19-91, [[Cambridge University Press]]: Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA.\n</ref> and considerable uncertainty in [[Global climate model|modeling]] how this will affect other aspects of climate such as local rainfall or temperatures. For most species the importance of specific climatic variables in defining distribution (e.g. minimum rainfall or maximum temperature) is unknown. It is also difficult to know which aspects of a particular climatic variable are most biologically relevant, such as average vs. maximum or minimum temperatures. Ecological processes such as interactions between species and dispersal rates and distances are also inherently complex, further complicating predictions.\n\nImprovement of models is an active area of research, with new models attempting to take factors such as life-history traits of species or processes such as migration into account when predicting distribution changes; though possible trade-offs between regional accuracy and generality are recognised.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thuiller W |title=Predicting global change impacts on plant species' distributions: Future challenges |journal=Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics |volume=9 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=137\u201352 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ppees.2007.09.004|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nClimate change is also predicted to interact with other drivers of biodiversity change such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, or the introduction of foreign species. These threats may possibly act in [[synergy]] to increase extinction risk from that seen in periods of rapid climate change in the past.<ref name=Mackey07/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Biodiversity]]\n* [[Biogeochemistry]]\n* [[Desertification]]\n* [[Extinction risk from climate change]]\n* [[Effects of global warming]]\n*[[Climate change and potatoes]]\n* [[Effects of climate change on wine production]]\n* [[Effects of climate change on marine mammals]]\n* [[Mycorrhizae and changing climate]]\n* [[Physical impacts of climate change]]\n* [[Systems ecology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author1=Thomas Lovejoy |author2=Lee Hannah  |title=Climate Change and Biodiversity|publisher=[[The Energy and Resources Institute|TERI]] Press |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-81-7993-084-7 |author1-link=Thomas Lovejoy }}\n*{{cite book |author=Tim Flannery |title=The Weather Makers: How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth |publisher=[[Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|Grove/Atlantic]] Press |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8021-4292-4|author-link=Tim Flannery }}\n\n==External links==\n*(2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20081201171718/http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-3/final-report/default.htm Government report on the effects of climate change on agriculture, land resources, water resources, and biodiversity in the United States.]\n*(2003) [http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-2977#download Summary report from an international conference on Global Climate Change and Biodiversity], [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]\n*(2008) [http://www.will.chez-alice.fr/pdf/ThuillerPPEES2008.pdf Discussion on the future of modeling climate change impacts on plant species distributions.] on wilfried thuiller's website\n*(2005) [https://web.archive.org/web/20150813135309/http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspx The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, including discussion of the effects of climate change on biodiversity]\n*[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=1354-1013 ''Global Change Biology'' - a scientific journal with articles relating to the interaction between global changes such as climate, and biological systems]\n*(2011) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20083-after-the-birds-vanish-plants-are-next-to-go.html After the birds vanish, the plants are next to go] - [[New Scientist]]\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = Loarie | first1 = S.

During this period, the Derg was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of opponents without trial in the [[Qey Shibir]] and the [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia]] resulting in 400,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=de Waal|first=Alex|year=1997|title=Famine Crimes: Politics & the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa|location=[[Oxford]]|publisher=[[James Currey]]|isbn=0-85255-810-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IwZ1Xb-w45oC}}</ref>\n\nThe EPRDF was formed by the union of the TPLF and the [[Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (EPDM) in early-1989. They were later joined by the [[Oromo People's Democratic Organization|OPDO]] (the Oromo members of the TPLF, EPLF, and EPDM) and the Ethiopian Democratic Officers' Revolutionary Movement (a small body of Derg officers captured by TPLF, most notably at [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] in February 1989, which was later disbanded after the establishment of the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]]).<ref name=\":0\">Vaughan, Sarah (2003).

Administrative reform encompassed several themes, namely simplification and streamlining of [[Government of Ethiopia|government bureaucracy]]; [[privatization]] of [[state-owned enterprise|state-owned enterprises]]; and adoption of measures, including [[tax reform]], in preparation for the expected strain on the [[Economy of Ethiopia|economy]] posed by a [[Demographics of Ethiopia#Population|rapidly growing population]].<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/23333/Ethiopia0s0gre0n0and0how0to0pace0it.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Ethiopia's Great Run: The Growth Acceleration and How to Pace It|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2015}}</ref> Other priorities in the early 1990s included the promotion of a more active and positive role for Ethiopia following the [[Ethiopian Civil War#Conclusion|collapse]] of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]], the [[internationalization]] of Ethiopia's economy by the [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] and promotion of domestic demand (expected to lead to the [[industrialization]]) and the promotion of [[Education in Ethiopia|education]].<ref name=\":1\"/> A business-inspired commitment to [[free enterprise]] was tempered by the insistence of [[protectionism]] and [[tariff]]s.\n\n== Election results ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Election\n!Leader\n!No. of candidates\n!No. of seats won\n!No. of Constituency votes\n!% of Constituency vote\n!Government/Opposition\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Ethiopian general election, 1995|1995]]\n|[[Meles Zenawi]]\n|1,881\n|{{composition bar|471|500|hex={{Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front/meta/color}}}}\n|16,429,727\n|82.9%\n|{{yes|Government}}\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Ethiopian general election, 2000|2000]]\n|[[Meles Zenawi]]\n|\n|{{composition bar|472|527|hex={{Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front/meta/color}}}}\n|\n|\n|{{yes|Government}}\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Ethiopian general election, 2005|2005]]\n|[[Meles Zenawi]]\n|\n|{{composition bar|327|527|hex={{Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front/meta/color}}}}\n|12,237,655\n|59.8%\n|{{yes|Government}}\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Ethiopian general election, 2010|2010]]\n|[[Meles Zenawi]]\n|1,349\n|{{composition bar|499|547|hex={{Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front/meta/color}}}}\n|\n|\n|{{yes|Government}}\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n![[Ethiopian general election, 2015|2015]]\n|[[Hailemariam Desalegn|Hailemariam Desalign]]\n|1,851\n|{{composition bar|500|547|hex={{Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front/meta/color}}}}\n|26,403,177\n|\n|{{yes|Government}}\n|}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|author=Vestal, Theodore|ref=CITEREFVestal1999|title=Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]]|year=1999|isbn=0275966100|edition=1st}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Ethiopian political parties}}{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front| ]]\n", "name_user": "123.202.14.45", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_People%27s_Revolutionary_Democratic_Front"}

Jackie is one of the two female leads throughout the show's life, and a love interest of [[Michael Kelso]].\n\n== Personality ==\nJackie is a [[Egocentrism|self-centered]], [[spoiled child|spoiled]], [[vanity|vain]] member of a wealthy family. She is generally insensitive to the needs and feelings of others, although regarded by many as attractive and fashionable. She is one of the program's most conceited characters, and she can behave quite selfishly. She looks down upon those of lower status in her school and has been said to treat them unfairly, and on the occasions she has treated them with respect, she has not continued to do so for very long or only did it knowing that she could be rewarded for behaving in such a manner, such as when she ran for the title of \"Snow Queen\" but was utterly disappointed when she loses the election.\n\nFor the most part, Jackie only cares about herself, and fashion is one of the few other things that she is concerned about. She believes herself to be very beautiful and appealing and has been involved in romantic relationships with [[Michael Kelso]], [[Steven Hyde]], and [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] at different points in the series. She starts to change when she starts dating Hyde and by doing so, becomes cemented as a member of the group. Even after her break up with Hyde, they remained good friends and she continued hanging around. She also becomes less shallow and cares about others. In the season 8 episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep185|Fun It]]\", it is revealed she has had [[coulrophobia]] (an irrational fear of [[clown]]s) since her seventh birthday party.\n\n== Friendships ==\nJackie's friendships tend to be complicated. While people might be endeared to her good heart and her triumphs over major life upheavals, her habit of being condescending to others keeps them at a distance.\n\nAlthough she frequently criticizes [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna]]'s dress, physique and feminism, she repeatedly calls herself Donna's best friend. Even though she thinks Donna is boring and unattractive when compared to herself, she believes Donna could do much better than [[Eric Forman|Eric]]. Despite their extremely different personalities, Donna serves as Jackie's [[de facto]] big sister and often tries to look out for her when she feels Jackie is making a mistake, more often than not due to lack of common sense. After her father is sent to prison in the middle of season five, Jackie moves in with the Pinciottis after the Formans learn that she has secretly been living with [[Steven Hyde|Hyde]] in his basement room. Jackie is also defensive of Donna; she displays this often by insulting or kicking Eric for doing something stupid, for example Eric makes a sexist comment so Jackie kicks him in the shin in the episode \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". Although both girls often tease one another they show genuine friendship. In the episode \"Squeeze Box\" Donna shows how much she trusts Jackie when she runs in to talk about Eric. Jackie also demonstrates her level of care for Donna when she helps pay for Donna's wedding ring in the episode \"No Quarter\".\n\nOf the group, Jackie and Eric seemed to dislike each other the most in the beginning, though as the series progresses, they develop a friendship. She is more like a sister to him in comparison to his own sister, Laurie. Throughout the series, the two have a clear \"frenemy\" relationship. They demonstrate their annoyance with each other, but show compassion for each other many times, and through it all, are close. In the beginning of the series, Jackie admits to trusting and liking Eric, confiding in him that she might be pregnant. In \"The Pill\", for example, she says to Eric's surprise, \"Look, I've always been able to trust you\u2014and, God, you are such a nice guy.\" Later in the episode, once Kelso threatens to break up with Jackie, Eric yells at him, having developed protective feelings towards her. This proves that their burning of each other throughout the show is only for laughs and friendly bickering, as none of their hostility is ever serious. Eric is consistent in ignoring Jackie as an object of sexual desire, but this changes in \"What Is and What Should Never Be\" where Hyde helps Eric realize that Jackie is \"hot\". After this, Eric has shown to have a sexual attraction to her, as shown in many episodes. Jackie is sometimes demeaning towards Eric, as she is to almost everyone, mostly due to his dorkiness and lack of physical prowess. They occasionally help each other out. In the episode \"Jackie's Cheese Squeeze\", Eric admits that they are \"friends\", as long as they don't refer to each other as such in public, and in the season seven finale, Jackie calls Eric from Chicago and admits that she's always cared for him and that he was always very special to her.\n\nEarly on, [[Red Forman|Red]] remarks she was the favorite of Eric's friends for her ability to hold a flashlight on a car.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Career Day| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = February 28, 1999| season = 1| number = 18}}</ref> Jackie has run crying into Red's arms no fewer than three times, all of which left him baffled and uncomfortable. Red finds Jackie as annoying as everyone else, but she still loves him because he's the closest thing she has to a father.\n\n== Relationships ==\nWhen the show premieres, Jackie is dating [[Michael Kelso]], a good-looking, brainless goofball. She decides to finally lose her virginity to him when he is released from jail after being mistakenly arrested for driving a stolen car.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Stolen Car| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = January 24, 1999| season = 1| number = 14}}</ref> Jackie gets on Kelso's friends' nerves on a daily basis and Kelso repeatedly says that he is going to break up with her. However, in the first season it is Jackie who ends the relationship \u2013 twice. First, after Kelso is caught kissing Pam Macy (they get back together in the very same episode) <ref>{{cite episode| title = Ski Trip| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = January 17, 1999| season = 1| number = 13}}</ref> and again after a pregnancy scare. However, admitting that they miss each other, they get back together at the Junior Prom.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Prom Night| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = March 7, 1999| season = 1| number = 19}}</ref>\n\nIn season 2, Kelso is seduced by Eric's promiscuous and manipulative sister, Laurie, who later on begins a physical affair with him. Later in the season, Jackie eventually discovers his repeated infidelities and breaks up with him without realizing that Kelso has told Laurie that he is done with her since he only loves Jackie.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Kiss of Death| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = March 20, 2000| season = 2| number = 20}}</ref> After this breakup she is openly hostile to Kelso and many things clearly remain unfinished between them. She often insults him in front of his friends to get his attention and just for the sake of bringing him up. By season 3, she does eventually warm up to him. Following Kelso's breakup with Laurie, Kelso apologizes to Jackie for cheating on her because now he knows how it feels to be cheated on as Laurie cheated on him, except he states that what happened to him and Jackie was different because they were actually really in love. After this, Jackie begins to notice that Kelso has matured somehow, so Jackie devises a series of \"tests\" for Kelso to see if they should reconcile. He passes her tests and they get back together.<ref>{{cite episode| title = The Trials of Michael Kelso| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = March 13, 2001| season = 3| number = 18}}</ref> Kelso remains loyal to Jackie after that and stays with her throughout season four, and they enjoy a happier, more loving relationship. However, towards the end of season 4, Jackie's father tells her that if she stays with Kelso, he will cut her off financially. She ends up choosing Kelso, and gets a job. Later, Kelso begins to spend less time with Jackie as a result of his joining a modeling agency and she is caught kissing her boss by Eric. This event spurs a period of discovery for Jackie and Kelso. After reading ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', Kelso realizes that the reason he cheated on Jackie with Laurie was because Jackie has always bossed him around and made him feel bad about himself. Following this revelation, he breaks up with her (true to form, the breakup doesn't stick and they reunite one episode later).<ref>{{cite episode| title = Everybody Loves Casey| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = May 14, 2002| season = 4| number = 26}}</ref>\n\nIn the season four finale, Jackie and Kelso both agree that they don't want to stay broken up. So, Jackie has Kelso choose to kiss any girl at The Hub to make things even between them and they can move on and be together again. Kelso surprises Jackie when he pretends to look around the room, but ends up choosing to kiss her. Jackie decides that it's time for Kelso to really choose her. Without warning, she brings up marriage to Kelso and decides that they're getting married. Kelso, feeling overwhelmed, runs away to California. When he returns in the beginning of season five, he (along with the others) is horrified to learn that she has begun dating [[Steven Hyde|Hyde]]. Jackie continues to date Hyde for most of the season, but when Kelso introduces Annette to the gang, Jackie finds herself clearly jealous and tells Donna that Michael is still supposed to pine over her. Later in the episode, she claims to not be jealous anymore, but the moment she sees Annette kissing Kelso, she screams, \"Get off my boyfriend!\" For the rest of the season, Kelso is clearly not over Jackie and doesn't realize that he's indirectly trying to win her back. Towards the end of season five, as Jackie comforts Kelso, he states that no one understands him like she does. In the finale, Kelso and Hyde make Jackie choose between the two of them and she chooses herself. By the beginning of season six, Kelso claims that he is happy and genuinely enjoying their new friendship. He spends the rest of the season trying to move on with his life, joins the police academy and impregnates a girl named Brooke and spends the rest of season 6 and 7 taking care of the baby. Towards the end of season seven, however, Kelso drives Jackie to Chicago after her break-up with Hyde, and Jackie asks him to spend some time with her before he leaves. He is later seen entering Jackie's hotel room in only a towel, implying that he and Jackie were about to sleep together, but runs off nude into the night when he sees that Hyde has come to the hotel to get Jackie back.<ref name=\"Till the Next Goodbye\">{{cite episode| title = Till the Next Goodbye| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = May 18, 2005| season = 7| number = 24}}</ref> \n\nIn the beginning of season eight, with Hyde married to a stripper, Jackie figures out her own life. Kelso considers marrying Jackie and states that the happiest time of his life was with Jackie and claims he still loves her. When [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] tells Jackie what Kelso intends, she considers the proposal and decides that if he asks, she will accept. However, he gets offered a job out of town and realizes he can move on with his life, but Fez reveals to him that he has already told Jackie of the proposal. Kelso grows angry, and states that he loves Jackie and that he knows in the future, they will be together, but now is not the right time, but since Fez has implied that Kelso will lose all of his chances with Jackie if he doesn't propose now, Kelso ends up proposing at Red and [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]]'s anniversary party, though, she turns him down giving practically the same reasons as Kelso, which is that she loves him, but he has a lot of maturing to do and she has her own life to figure out so now is not the right time for them yet. They both feel an unexpected relief, and end on good terms.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Misfire| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = November 16, 2005| season = 8| number = 5}}</ref>\n\nJackie and [[Steven Hyde]] are, from the beginning of the show, polar opposites and even enemies. She is disgusted by his poverty and crass behavior, he scorns her superficiality and materialism. They strongly dislike each other during the first season, but begin to form a bond when Hyde helps Jackie cope with her breakup with Kelso in season two. This leads to a brief period in which Jackie is infatuated with Hyde, but her feelings gradually fade. It isn't until season five, when Kelso is in California, that their romance begins. After watching ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' together all summer, the two begin making out every time they have a moment alone.<ref>{{cite episode| title = I Can't Quit You, Baby| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = September 24, 2002| season = 5| number = 2}}</ref> When their friends discover the relationship, they each insist that they are not dating and that it is purely physical, but finally give in and admit that what they have goes deeper than just sex. They date for most of season five until Jackie sees Kelso kissing Annette and yells \"Get off my boyfriend!\" Hyde reacts angrily to this and grows suspicious of Jackie. When he sees Jackie holding Kelso in her arms, knowing Jackie and Kelso's long history and on-off relationship, Hyde assumes that something must be going on between her and Kelso again. Despite her pleas that she was only comforting him and that nothing untoward happened, he doesn't believe her and he takes revenge by spending the night with another woman. When he realizes that Jackie has been telling the truth, he confesses his infidelity. A heartbroken Jackie ends the relationship immediately.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Nobody's Fault But Mine| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = April 23, 2003| season = 5| number = 23}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of season six, Kelso and Hyde are in competition to get Jackie back because they both still love her. She decides she needs time to think about it, leaving them to wait and agonize, but chooses Hyde in the end.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Join Together| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = November 5, 2003| season = 6| number = 2}}</ref> Their relationship goes on until Jackie is offered a job in Chicago. She is torn between her relationship and her professional ambition, but tells Hyde that she will stay if he can gives her the merest hope that they will eventually get married. Hyde has no immediate answer, and when he finally decides, he is upset to realize that she has already gone (or so he thinks). Jackie has no way out of Point Place, and in a final attempt to get an answer out of Hyde, she goes to the basement. Hiding his hurt and anger that she \"left\" him, Hyde tells her to have a good trip.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Short and Curlies| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = May 18, 2005| season = 7| number = 23}}</ref>\n\nHyde decides he still wants her, and goes to her Chicago hotel to persuade her to take him back. During his conversation with Jackie, Kelso walks into the hotel room with a towel around his waist and a bucket of ice in his hands and implying that he and Jackie were about to have sex.<ref name=\"Till the Next Goodbye\" /> Hyde goes to Las Vegas. When he comes back to Point Place, he has impulsively married a stripper named Samantha and she follows him back to Wisconsin.  This effectively ends his and Jackie's relationship.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Bohemian Rhapsody| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = November 2, 2005| season = 8| number = 1}}</ref>\n\nThroughout season eight, Jackie remains single. She and Hyde, no longer together, have since remained good friends. However, their behavior regresses to how it was in the earlier seasons. Fez tells Jackie that Kelso intends to propose to her, and she decides that she will accept, but after considering it, she turns him down claiming that though she loves Kelso, he still has a lot of maturing to do, and now is not the time for them to be together. Feeling that she is in a low point in her life, Jackie decides to find someone that would be perfect for her and writes out a list of what she wants in a man. She is surprised to find out that Fez matches everything on the list. She denies this at first, but quickly comes around to the idea and decides to wait for Fez to come to her. Fez, however, is clueless of her attraction to him and is instead seeing other women at the time, which makes it hard for her. Jackie then chooses to go to him. She kisses him and asks if they can be together because he is the one good thing in her life right now, but Fez turns her down, feeling that she is treating him as a last resort, citing how she has already dated both Kelso and Hyde. Jackie then goes to the bathroom and cries, but immediately after vows revenge on Fez. She flushes his toothbrush, microwaves his lotion, and ruins his car with graffiti. To get back at Jackie, Fez dyes her hair green, and says that now she is ugly on the outside like she is on the inside. Hurt by Fez's words, Jackie decides to move out. However, she later learns through one of his friends that he loves her and wishes that he had never said those things. They eventually reconcile and in the final episode, Fez and Jackie finally get together and kiss atop the water tower.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{That '70s Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burkhart, Jackie}}\n[[Category:Fictional cannabis users]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional cheerleaders]]\n[[Category:That '70s Show characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n\n[[sv:That '70s Show#Rollfigurer]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{multiple issues|{{Notability|fiction|date=September 2017}}\n{{primary sources|date=October 2015}}\n{{original research|date=October 2015}}\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Jackie Burkhart\n| series             = [[That '70s Show]]\n| image              = JackieBurkhartSeason8.jpg\n| first=\"[[That '70s Pilot]]\"<br />(episode 1.01)\n| last=\"[[That '70s Finale]]\"<br />(episode 8.22)\n| creator            = [[Mark Brazill]]\n| portrayer          = [[Mila Kunis]]<br />Katya Abelski (Jackie at 6)<br />Alexandra Brandi (Jackie at 12)\n| nickname           = \n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = Cheese maiden (formerly)<br />Personal assistant (formerly)<br />Television show host (formerly)\n| family             = Jack Burkhart (father)<br />Pam Burkhart (mother)\n| relatives          = Carla (cousin)\n| significant_other  = [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] (boyfriend)<br />[[Michael Kelso]] (ex-boyfriend)<br />[[Steven Hyde]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| nationality        = [[United States|American]]\n| full_name          = Jacqueline Beulah Burkhart\n}}\n\n'''Jacqueline Beulah Burkhart''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] portrayed by [[Mila Kunis]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] [[sitcom]] ''[[That '70s Show]]''. Jackie is one of the two female leads throughout the show's life, and a love interest of [[Michael Kelso]].\n\n== Personality ==\nJackie is a [[Egocentrism|self-centered]], [[spoiled child|spoiled]], [[vanity|vain]] member of a wealthy family. She is generally insensitive to the needs and feelings of others, although regarded by many as attractive and fashionable. She is one of the program's most conceited characters, and she can behave quite selfishly. She looks down upon those of lower status in her school and has been said to treat them unfairly, and on the occasions she has treated them with respect, she has not continued to do so for very long or only did it knowing that she could be rewarded for behaving in such a manner, such as when she ran for the title of \"Snow Queen\" but was utterly disappointed when she loses the election.\n\nFor the most part, Jackie only cares about herself, and fashion is among one of the few other things that she is concerned about. She believes herself to be very beautiful and appealing and has been involved in romantic relationships with [[Michael Kelso]], [[Steven Hyde]], and [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] at different points in the series. She starts to change when she starts dating Hyde and by doing so, becomes cemented as a member of the group. Even after her break up with Hyde, they remained good friends and she continued hanging around. She also becomes less shallow and cares about others. In the season 8 episode \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep185|Fun It]]\", it is revealed she has had [[coulrophobia]] (an irrational fear of [[clown]]s) since her seventh birthday party.\n\n== Friendships ==\nJackie's friendships tend to be complicated. While people might be endeared to her good heart and her triumphs over major life upheavals, her habit of being condescending to others keeps them at a distance.\n\nAlthough she frequently criticizes [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna]]'s dress, physique and feminism, she repeatedly calls herself Donna's best friend. Even though she thinks Donna is boring and unattractive when compared to herself, she believes Donna could do much better than [[Eric Forman|Eric]]. Despite their extremely different personalities, Donna serves as Jackie's [[de facto]] big sister and often tries to look out for her when she feels Jackie is making a mistake, more often than not due to lack of common sense. After her father is sent to prison in the middle of season five, Jackie moves in with the Pinciottis after the Formans learn that she has secretly been living with [[Steven Hyde|Hyde]] in his basement room. Jackie is also defensive of Donna; she displays this often by insulting or kicking Eric for doing something stupid, for example Eric makes a sexist comment so Jackie kicks him in the shin in the episode \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". Although both girls often tease one another they show genuine friendship. In the episode \"Squeeze Box\" Donna shows how much she trusts Jackie when she runs in to talk about Eric. Jackie also demonstrates her level of care for Donna when she helps pay for Donna's wedding ring in the episode \"No Quarter\".\n\nOf the group, Jackie and Eric seemed to dislike each other the most in the beginning, though as the series progresses, they develop a friendship. She is more like a sister to him in comparison to his own sister, Laurie. Throughout the series, the two have a clear \"frenemy\" relationship. They demonstrate their annoyance with each other, but show compassion for each other many times, and through it all, are close. In the beginning of the series, Jackie admits to trusting and liking Eric, confiding in him that she might be pregnant. In \"The Pill\", for example, she says to Eric's surprise, \"Look, I've always been able to trust you\u2014and, God, you are such a nice guy.\" Later in the episode, once Kelso threatens to break up with Jackie, Eric yells at him, having developed protective feelings towards her. This proves that their burning of each other throughout the show is only for laughs and friendly bickering, as none of their hostility is ever serious. Eric is consistent in ignoring Jackie as an object of sexual desire, but this changes in \"What Is and What Should Never Be\" where Hyde helps Eric realize that Jackie is \"hot\". After this, Eric has shown to have a sexual attraction to her, as shown in many episodes. Jackie is sometimes demeaning towards Eric, as she is to almost everyone, mostly due to his dorkiness and lack of physical prowess. They occasionally help each other out. In the episode \"Jackie's Cheese Squeeze\", Eric admits that they are \"friends\", as long as they don't refer to each other as such in public, and in the season seven finale, Jackie calls Eric from Chicago and admits that she's always cared for him and that he was always very special to her.\n\nEarly on, [[Red Forman|Red]] remarks she was the favorite of Eric's friends for her ability to hold a flashlight on a car.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Career Day| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = February 28, 1999| season = 1| number = 18}}</ref> Jackie has run crying into Red's arms no fewer than three times, all of which left him baffled and uncomfortable. Red finds Jackie as annoying as everyone else, but she still loves him because he's the closest thing she has to a father.\n\n== Relationships ==\nWhen the show premieres, Jackie is dating [[Michael Kelso]], a good-looking, brainless goofball. She decides to finally lose her virginity to him when he is released from jail after being mistakenly arrested for driving a stolen car.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Stolen Car| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = January 24, 1999| season = 1| number = 14}}</ref> Jackie gets on Kelso's friends' nerves on a daily basis and Kelso repeatedly says that he is going to break up with her. However, in the first season it is Jackie who ends the relationship \u2013 twice. First, after Kelso is caught kissing Pam Macy (they get back together in the very same episode) <ref>{{cite episode| title = Ski Trip| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = January 17, 1999| season = 1| number = 13}}</ref> and again after a pregnancy scare. However, admitting that they miss each other, they get back together at the Junior Prom.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Prom Night| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = March 7, 1999| season = 1| number = 19}}</ref>\n\nIn season 2, Kelso is seduced by Eric's promiscuous and manipulative sister, Laurie, who later on begins a physical affair with him. Later in the season, Jackie eventually discovers his repeated infidelities and breaks up with him without realizing that Kelso has told Laurie that he is done with her since he only loves Jackie.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Kiss of Death| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = March 20, 2000| season = 2| number = 20}}</ref> After this breakup she is openly hostile to Kelso and many things clearly remain unfinished between them. She often insults him in front of his friends to get his attention and just for the sake of bringing him up. By season 3, she does eventually warm up to him. Following Kelso's breakup with Laurie, Kelso apologizes to Jackie for cheating on her because now he knows how it feels to be cheated on as Laurie cheated on him, except he states that what happened to him and Jackie was different because they were actually really in love. After this, Jackie begins to notice that Kelso has matured somehow, so Jackie devises a series of \"tests\" for Kelso to see if they should reconcile. He passes her tests and they get back together.<ref>{{cite episode| title = The Trials of Michael Kelso| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = March 13, 2001| season = 3| number = 18}}</ref> Kelso remains loyal to Jackie after that and stays with her throughout season four, and they enjoy a happier, more loving relationship. However, towards the end of season 4, Jackie's father tells her that if she stays with Kelso, he will cut her off financially. She ends up choosing Kelso, and gets a job. Later, Kelso begins to spend less time with Jackie as a result of his joining a modeling agency and she is caught kissing her boss by Eric. This event spurs a period of discovery for Jackie and Kelso. After reading ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', Kelso realizes that the reason he cheated on Jackie with Laurie was because Jackie has always bossed him around and made him feel bad about himself. Following this revelation, he breaks up with her (true to form, the breakup doesn't stick and they reunite one episode later).<ref>{{cite episode| title = Everybody Loves Casey| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = May 14, 2002| season = 4| number = 26}}</ref>\n\nIn the season four finale, Jackie and Kelso both agree that they don't want to stay broken up. So, Jackie has Kelso choose to kiss any girl at The Hub to make things even between them and they can move on and be together again. Kelso surprises Jackie when he pretends to look around the room, but ends up choosing to kiss her. Jackie decides that it's time for Kelso to really choose her. Without warning, she brings up marriage to Kelso and decides that they're getting married. Kelso, feeling overwhelmed, runs away to California. When he returns in the beginning of season five, he (along with the others) is horrified to learn that she has begun dating [[Steven Hyde|Hyde]]. Jackie continues to date Hyde for most of the season, but when Kelso introduces Annette to the gang, Jackie finds herself clearly jealous and tells Donna that Michael is still supposed to pine over her. Later in the episode, she claims to not be jealous anymore, but the moment she sees Annette kissing Kelso, she screams, \"Get off my boyfriend!\" For the rest of the season, Kelso is clearly not over Jackie and doesn't realize that he's indirectly trying to win her back. Towards the end of season five, as Jackie comforts Kelso, he states that no one understands him like she does. In the finale, Kelso and Hyde make Jackie choose between the two of them and she chooses herself. By the beginning of season six, Kelso claims that he is happy and genuinely enjoying their new friendship. He spends the rest of the season trying to move on with his life, joins the police academy and impregnates a girl named Brooke and spends the rest of season 6 and 7 taking care of the baby. Towards the end of season seven, however, Kelso drives Jackie to Chicago after her break-up with Hyde, and Jackie asks him to spend some time with her before he leaves. He is later seen entering Jackie's hotel room in only a towel, implying that he and Jackie were about to sleep together, but runs off nude into the night when he sees that Hyde has come to the hotel to get Jackie back.<ref name=\"Till the Next Goodbye\">{{cite episode| title = Till the Next Goodbye| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = May 18, 2005| season = 7| number = 24}}</ref> \n\nIn the beginning of season eight, with Hyde married to a stripper, Jackie figures out her own life. Kelso considers marrying Jackie and states that the happiest time of his life was with Jackie and claims he still loves her. When [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] tells Jackie what Kelso intends, she considers the proposal and decides that if he asks, she will accept. However, he gets offered a job out of town and realizes he can move on with his life, but Fez reveals to him that he has already told Jackie of the proposal. Kelso grows angry, and states that he loves Jackie and that he knows in the future, they will be together, but now is not the right time, but since Fez has implied that Kelso will lose all of his chances with Jackie if he doesn't propose now, Kelso ends up proposing at Red and [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]]'s anniversary party, though, she turns him down giving practically the same reasons as Kelso, which is that she loves him, but he has a lot of maturing to do and she has her own life to figure out so now is not the right time for them yet. They both feel an unexpected relief, and end on good terms.<ref>{{cite episode| title = Misfire| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = November 16, 2005| season = 8| number = 5}}</ref>\n\nJackie and [[Steven Hyde]] are, from the beginning of the show, polar opposites and even enemies. She is disgusted by his poverty and crass behavior, he scorns her superficiality and materialism. They strongly dislike each other during the first season, but begin to form a bond when Hyde helps Jackie cope with her breakup with Kelso in season two. This leads to a brief period in which Jackie is infatuated with Hyde, but her feelings gradually fade. It isn't until season five, when Kelso is in California, that their romance begins. After watching ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' together all summer, the two begin making out every time they have a moment alone.<ref>{{cite episode| title = I Can't Quit You, Baby| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = September 24, 2002| season = 5| number = 2}}</ref> When their friends discover the relationship, they each insist that they are not dating and that it is purely physical, but finally give in and admit that what they have goes deeper than just sex.
