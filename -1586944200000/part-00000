In 1805 Christian Dierig founded a weaving company (''Christian Dierig AG''). During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the village was occupied by [[First French Empire|France]]. In 1844 it was the site of the [[Weavers' Uprising]], brutally crushed by the Prussians.<ref name=um/> From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. In 1891 the [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w]]\u2013Bielawa railway line opened. In 1924 Bielawa obtained [[town rights]].<ref name=um/> During [[World War II]] the Germans established the ''FAL Langenbielau II'' [[List of subcamps of Gross-Rosen|subcamp]] of the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.gross-rosen.eu/historia-kl-gross-rosen/filie-obozu-gross-rosen/|title=Subcamps of KL Gross- Rosen|website=Gross-Rosen Museum in Rogo\u017anica|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref> In 1945 it was captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and eventually reintegrated with Poland. [[Greeks in Poland|Greeks]], refugees of the [[Greek Civil War]], settled in Bielawa in the 1950s.<ref>Izabela Kubasiewicz, ''Emigranci z Grecji w Polsce Ludowej.

At its center is the 19th-century [[Neo-Gothic]] Church of the Assumption with a 101 m tall tower, the third tallest in Poland. Other interesting buildings include a late-[[Renaissance]] palace originally built as a [[fortified]] [[manor house]]; the Church of the [[Blessed Sacrament|Corpus Christi]], erected in 1743; and numerous 18th-century [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] houses that were restored in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Since 1999, it has been situated in [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w County]], [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]]. From 1975\u20131998, it was part of the [[Wa\u0142brzych Voivodeship]].\n\nBielawa lies in the central part of Lower Silesia, along the Bielawica stream in the [[Owl Mountains|Sowie Mountains]] region. The town covers an area in excess of {{convert|36|km2|sqmi|0}}.\n\nBielawa lies at an altitude range of 280 and 964 m above sea level, in the Sowie Mountains. It is considered one of the most naturally beautiful regions of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, and is a year-round tourist destination. Its outdoor attractions include four major [[hiking]] [[trails]] of varying difficulty in an 80 square kilometer scenic park, as well as [[cycling|cycling trails]] and [[ski lift]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Zbiornik Sudety w Bielawie.jpg|thumb|left|Parkowa Hill and Bielawa Lake in Bielawa]]\nThe oldest known mention of Bielawa dates back to 1288, when it was part of fragmented [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]].<ref name=um>{{cite web|url=https://um.bielawa.pl/pl/turystyka/historia-miasta|title=Historia miasta|website=um.bielawa.pl|accessdate=14 March 2020|language=Polish}}</ref> Its name is of Polish origin and is derived from the word ''biela'', ''bila'', current Polish ''bia\u0142a'' (\"[[white]]\").<ref name=um/>\n\nIn 1720 the first brick house was built in the village and in 1741 it was captured and afterwards annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. In 1805 Christian Dierig founded a weaving company (''Christian Dierig AG''). During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the village was occupied by [[First French Empire|France]]. In 1844 it was the site of the [[Weavers' Uprising]], brutally crushed by the Prussians.<ref name=um/> From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. In 1891 the [[Dzier\u017coni\u00f3w]]\u2013Bielawa railway line opened. In 1924 Bielawa obtained [[town rights]].<ref name=um/> During [[World War II]] the Germans established the ''FAL Langenbielau II'' [[List of subcamps of Gross-Rosen|subcamp]] of the [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]] in the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.gross-rosen.eu/historia-kl-gross-rosen/filie-obozu-gross-rosen/|title=Subcamps of KL Gross- Rosen|website=Gross-Rosen Museum in Rogo\u017anica|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref> In 1945 it was captured by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and eventually reintegrated with Poland. [[Greeks in Poland|Greeks]], refugees of the [[Greek Civil War]], settled in Bielawa in the 1950s.<ref>Izabela Kubasiewicz, ''Emigranci z Grecji w Polsce Ludowej.

At its center is the 19th-century [[Neo-Gothic]] Church of the Assumption with a 101 m tall tower, the third tallest in Poland. Other interesting buildings include a late-[[Renaissance]] palace originally built as a [[fortified]] [[manor house]]; the Church of the [[Blessed Sacrament|Corpus Christi]], erected in 1743; and numerous 18th-century [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] houses that were restored in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

This is one of the 42 municipalities of the department.\n\nThe town is known for having within its jurisdiction the hacienda \"El Para\u00edso\", where the writer [[Jorge Isaacs]] lived and set his novel Mar\u00eda. Part of its territory also belongs to the [[Parque Nacional Natural Las Hermosas]]. Is situated 47&nbsp;km east to [[Cali]], the capital of the department.\n\n== Toponim ==\nThe name of the municipality and the head is of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin (''El Cerrito'' translates literally into [[English language|English]] as ''The Small Hill''), and it refers to the hill where the population resides. It is a massif in the Colombian Andes Region.\n\n== Geography ==\nIt is located on a plain by the river that bears its name, on the western slope of the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Cordillera Central.]]\n\nIts coordinates are between 1\u00b013' to [[2nd meridian west|2\u00b0 West]] longitude and [[4th parallel north|4\u00b0]] to [[5th parallel north|5\u00b0 North]] latitude, at an altitude of 987 [[metre|m]] over sea level and its average temperature is 24&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIts topography comprises two areas: The first one is the mountainous western side of [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Cordillera Central]]; its highest peaks are [[Paramo de las Hermosas]] (3,500 meters high), the [[Cerro Pan de Az\u00facar]] and [[El Alto de la Cruz]]. The second area is flat or slightly wavy and belongs to the valley of the [[Cauca River]]. The territory corresponds to the thermal floors warm, half cold and wilderness. The hydrography of the municipality is composed by the rivers [[Amaime]], [[Rio Cauca|Cauca]], [[Rio Cerrito|Cerrito]] and [[Sabaletas]], along with several creeks and smaller streams, and the lagoon Three Americas.\n\n=== Boundaries ===\nThis municipality is bordered by [[Guacari]] and [[Ginebra, Valle del Cauca|Ginebra]] to the North, by [[Chaparral, Tolima|Chaparral]] in the [[Departments of Colombia|Department]] of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] on the East, [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]] to the south and by [[Vijes]] to the West.\n\n=== Precinct and districts ===\nTheir townships are: [[Santa Elena (Valle)|Santa Elena]], El Placer, San Antonio, Santa Luisa, El Pomo, El Castillo, El Moral, El Carrizal, Auj\u00ed, Los Andes and Tenerife.\n\nThe municipal seat is divided into neighborhoods San Rafael, Santa B\u00e1rbara, Chapinero, Buenos Aires, Eduardo Cabal Molina, La Estrella, El Rosario, Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n, \u00c1lvaro Navia Prado, El Cincuentenario, La Esperanza, Sajonia, Pueblito Valluno, Coincer, Villa del Carmen, Los Samanes, Villa Cari\u00f1o, Villa La Paz, Brisas de la Merced (El Teatrino), Nuevo Amanecer and El Porvenir.\n\n== A brief history ==\n[[File:Jose Serrano Cali Estatua Belalcazar.jpg|200px|thumb|Statue of [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]] in [[Cali]].]]\n\nSebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar and his troops conquered this territory, that was populated by Native Pijaos, whounder the command of [[cacique]] Calarc\u00e1 were submitted by the Europeans.\n\nAn important figure in the era of conquest is Maria Luisa de la Espada, who was born in Canton Buga. Daughter of a Spaniard, she inherited the family's trust, writing a story and legend of charm that attracts thousands of tourists to walk the roads that climb to the district of Tenerife to visit the many houses on the road and the ruins of her castle.\n\nIn the region of Guaz\u00e1bara -where the Amerindians worshiped the tree \"Totujandi\"- Captain Gregorio de Astigarreta built the hacienda San Jer\u00f3nimo de los Ingenios, that was placed in jurisdiction of Guacari county, and where the village originally settled in 1797. The Cabildo of Cali created Pantanillo county with jurisdiction between the rivers Las Guabas and Nima, and in 1821 it was transferred\nto the Canton of Buga, then it was finally moved to the land that was donated by ladies Petrona and Sebastiana C\u00e1rdenas.\n\nThe first Mass was offered by Father Manuel Jos\u00e9 Guzm\u00e1n on August 30, 1825 and the place was named San Jer\u00f3nimo.

Sutcliffe left the band to pursue his career as a painter, having previously attended the [[Liverpool College of Art]]. Sutcliffe and [[John Lennon]] are credited with inventing the name \"Beetles\", as they both liked [[Buddy Holly]]'s band, [[the Crickets]]. The band used this name for a while until Lennon decided to change the name to \"The Beatles\", from the word ''[[Beat music|beat]]''. As a member of the group when it was a five-piece band, Sutcliffe is one of several people sometimes referred to as the \"[[Fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nWhen he performed with [[the Beatles in Hamburg]], he met photographer [[Astrid Kirchherr]], to whom he was later engaged. After leaving the Beatles, he enrolled in the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg|Hamburg College of Art]], studying under future [[pop art]]ist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/report.aspx |title=Report by Eduardo Paolozzi, 23 October 1961 |website=liverpoolmuseums | access-date=3 January 2017 }}</ref> Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings, which mostly explored a style related to [[abstract expressionism]].\n\nWhile studying in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light. In April 1962, he collapsed in the middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various tests, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. After collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been a [[brain hemorrhage]] \u2013 severe bleeding in his brain's right ventricle.\n\n==Early years==\nSutcliffe's father, Charles Sutcliffe (25 May 1905&nbsp;\u2013 18 March 1966), was previously married to his first wife Martha with whom he'd already had four children. He was a senior civil servant, who moved to [[Liverpool]] to help with wartime work in 1943, and then signed on as a ship's engineer, and so was often at sea during his son's early years. His mother, Millie (1907-1983), was a schoolteacher at an infants' school.{{sfn|Norman|2005|p=62}} Sutcliffe had two younger sisters, Pauline and Joyce, but also had three older half-brothers, Joe, Ian, and Charles, as well as an older half-sister Mattie, from his father's first marriage.{{sfn|Kane|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Tufnell|Cornish|1998|p=30}}\n\nSutcliffe was born at the [[Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion]] in Edinburgh, Scotland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McGinty|first=Stephen|title=Stephen McGinty: Scotland meant a lot more to the Beatles than just Mull of Kintyre|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/stephen_mcginty_scotland_meant_a_lot_more_to_the_beatles_than_just_mull_of_kintyre_1_1795434|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman | location = Edinburgh |date=12 August 2011}}</ref> and after his family moved to England,<ref name=\"Stuart Sutcliffe Estate\">{{cite web |url=http://stuartsutcliffeart.com/about_stuart.html |title=Stuart |publisher=Stuart Sutcliffe Estate |access-date=1 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622064538/http://stuartsutcliffeart.com/about_stuart.html |archive-date=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> he was brought up at 37 [[Aigburth]] Drive in Liverpool.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1989|p=88}} He attended Park View Primary School, [[Huyton]] (1946\u20131951), and [[Prescot School|Prescot Grammar School]] from 4 September 1951 to 1956.<ref>http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/stuart-sutcliffe-school-beatles-story-11512980</ref> When Sutcliffe's father did return home on leave, he invited his son and art college classmate, Rod Murray (also Sutcliffe's roommate and best friend), for a \"real good [[Alcoholic beverage|booze-up]]\", slipping \u00a310 into Sutcliffe's pocket before disappearing for another six months.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=105}} The Beatles' biographer, [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], wrote that Charles Sutcliffe was a heavy drinker and physically cruel to his wife, which the young Sutcliffe had witnessed.{{sfn|Norman|2005|p=62}}\n\nDuring his first year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a [[bin man]] on the [[Liverpool Corporation]]'s waste collection trucks.<ref name=\"Sutcliffe's cheque book\">[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp Sutcliffe's cheque book -] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608062041/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp |date=8 June 2011 }} liverpoolmuseums.org.uk.

Sutcliffe''' (23 June 1940&nbsp;\u2013 10 April 1962) was a Scottish painter and musician best known as the original [[bass guitarist]] for the English rock band [[the Beatles]]. Sutcliffe left the band to pursue his career as a painter, having previously attended the [[Liverpool College of Art]]. Sutcliffe and [[John Lennon]] are credited with inventing the name \"Beetles\", as they both liked [[Buddy Holly]]'s band, [[the Crickets]]. The band used this name for a while until Lennon decided to change the name to \"The Beatles\", from the word ''[[Beat music|beat]]''. As a member of the group when it was a five-piece band, Sutcliffe is one of several people sometimes referred to as the \"[[Fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nWhen he performed with [[the Beatles in Hamburg]], he met photographer [[Astrid Kirchherr]], to whom he was later engaged. After leaving the Beatles, he enrolled in the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg|Hamburg College of Art]], studying under future [[pop art]]ist [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/report.aspx |title=Report by Eduardo Paolozzi, 23 October 1961 |website=liverpoolmuseums | access-date=3 January 2017 }}</ref> Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings, which mostly explored a style related to [[abstract expressionism]].\n\nWhile studying in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light. In April 1962, he collapsed in the middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various tests, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. After collapsing again on 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been a [[brain hemorrhage]] \u2013 severe bleeding in his brain's right ventricle.\n\n==Early years==\nSutcliffe's father, Charles Sutcliffe (25 May 1905&nbsp;\u2013 18 March 1966), was previously married to his first wife Martha with whom he'd already had four children. He was a senior civil servant, who moved to [[Liverpool]] to help with wartime work in 1943, and then signed on as a ship's engineer, and so was often at sea during his son's early years. His mother, Millie (1907-1983), was a schoolteacher at an infants' school.{{sfn|Norman|2005|p=62}} Sutcliffe had two younger sisters, Pauline and Joyce, but also had three older half-brothers, Joe, Ian, and Charles, as well as an older half-sister Mattie, from his father's first marriage.{{sfn|Kane|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Tufnell|Cornish|1998|p=30}}\n\nSutcliffe was born at the [[Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion]] in Edinburgh, Scotland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McGinty|first=Stephen|title=Stephen McGinty: Scotland meant a lot more to the Beatles than just Mull of Kintyre|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/stephen_mcginty_scotland_meant_a_lot_more_to_the_beatles_than_just_mull_of_kintyre_1_1795434|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman | location = Edinburgh |date=12 August 2011}}</ref> and after his family moved to England,<ref name=\"Stuart Sutcliffe Estate\">{{cite web |url=http://stuartsutcliffeart.com/about_stuart.html |title=Stuart |publisher=Stuart Sutcliffe Estate |access-date=1 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622064538/http://stuartsutcliffeart.com/about_stuart.html |archive-date=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> he was brought up at 37 [[Aigburth]] Drive in Liverpool.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1989|p=88}} He attended Park View Primary School, [[Huyton]] (1946\u20131951), and [[Prescot School|Prescot Grammar School]] from 4 September 1951 to 1956.<ref>http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/stuart-sutcliffe-school-beatles-story-11512980</ref> When Sutcliffe's father did return home on leave, he invited his son and art college classmate, Rod Murray (also Sutcliffe's roommate and best friend), for a \"real good [[Alcoholic beverage|booze-up]]\", slipping \u00a310 into Sutcliffe's pocket before disappearing for another six months.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=105}} The Beatles' biographer, [[Philip Norman (author)|Philip Norman]], wrote that Charles Sutcliffe was a heavy drinker and physically cruel to his wife, which the young Sutcliffe had witnessed.{{sfn|Norman|2005|p=62}}\n\nDuring his first year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a [[bin man]] on the [[Liverpool Corporation]]'s waste collection trucks.<ref name=\"Sutcliffe's cheque book\">[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp Sutcliffe's cheque book -] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608062041/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp |date=8 June 2011 }} liverpoolmuseums.org.uk.

The news program used a touch-screen television called \"Aksyon Board.\" It is the first local newscast to report via Live-Pack in contrast to the [[Outside broadcasting|OB Vans]] used by its competitors. There is also a round-up news update called Aksyon Ngayon anchored by Dindo Flora, Cristina Lazo, and former [[DWRR-FM|Tambayan 101.9 (now MOR 101.9)]] DJ Reggie Valdez.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, [[Erwin Tulfo]] of the police-report-and-public-service-segment Aksyon Metro joined the newscast and their time slot was moved to 6:00 PM, then 5:45 PM, and then 5:30 PM serving as a former lead-in to the network's former variety shows ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie/Wil Time Bigtime]]''. On that same day, the newscast also introduced a new [[augmented virtuality]] set and OBB. Since November 8, 2010, the newscast began its simulcast on the newly launched [[DWFM|Radyo5 92.3 News FM]].\n\n<!-- Bediones was absent on his fixed last day on Aksyon - February 18. -->\nOn February 17, 2011, [[Paolo Bediones]] left the newscast for ''Aksyon JournalisMO'', leaving Cosim and Tulfo as the main anchors, with Shawn Yao (showbiz and weather) and Makata Tawanan (Makata's Super Bidyo) as segment anchors. The newscast was also given new weekday graphics and new virtual background while starting its simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] on February 21, 2011.\n\nOn June 6, 2011, the newscast added a news desk while updating their graphics and title card. \"Makata's Super Bidyo,\" a video features segment, was reformatted with its new name \"Makatang Gala\" (The Stray Poet), where Makata Tawanan goes on streets to bring information to its viewers. By July 25, 2011, [[Lourd de Veyra]] joined the newscast, hosting his weather-and-trivia-segment \"Weather or Not\", which includes relevant and historical bites after de Veyra presents the weather.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Aksyon divided into two parts, Metro Aksyon focused on police reports around Metro Manila, and Rodolfo Jun Sabayton hosted \"Anong Problema Mo\", while remaining 30 minutes is the national and other news. It then became an emergency protocol when its former lead-in public service program, ''[[T3: Alliance|T3: Kapatid, Sagot Kita]]'', of the Tulfo brothers was given a long-term suspension by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] following numerous controversies that hounded the show. By February 20, 2012, Aksyon modified its newsdesk and updating its graphics and title card.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Aksyon reexpand its time to 45 minutes, from 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM. It then launched a new segment entitled ''Happy News'', a segment that focuses on light-hearted topics (e.g., travel, food, festivals, etc.) that reflects the Filipino's happy spirit. It has become the newscast's closing segment since its launch.\n\nIn June 2013, when [[Sports5]] did not renew a blocktime agreement with [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] to air the [[AKTV]] sports block due to high blocktime costs and low ratings, the newscast's simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] was limited to give way for the primetime sports programming on AksyonTV.\n\nOn October 14, 2013, along with the launch of News5's primetime block '''KBO: Karunungan, Balita, Opinyon''', Aksyon updated its newsdesk, graphics and title card. later, Aksyon became a 1-hour newscast from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nOn December 23, 2013, Aksyon, along with other [[News5]] programs, transferred from its former TV5 Studio Complex in Novaliches, Quezon City to a larger [[TV5 Media Center]] in Reliance, [[Mandaluyong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n5e.interaksyon.com/top/4EA1A901A12646E/1001/bagong-tahanan-ng-tv5-sa-mandaluyong-silipin|title= Bagong Tahanan ng TV5 sa Mandaluyong, Silipin|publisher=News5 Everywhere|accessdate= 21 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, the newscast has two new segments. Caught in Aksyon focuses on issues \u2013 accidents, violation, and wrongful activities caught on CCTV Cameras. ''Makatarugan Ba?'' is about the issues that one or more individuals has a violations in a law, as explained by Atty. Mel Sta. Maria.\n\n=== Expansion (2014\u20132017) ===\n\nOn July 21, 2014, \"Aksyon\" expanded its newscast by revamping four separate newscasts: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' (replacing [[Good Morning Club]]), ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' (the reincarnation of [[Balitaang Tapat]]) back-to-back with T3 Enforced (after moving to noontime slot), the reformatted flagship ''Aksyon Prime'', and ''Aksyon Tonite'' (replacing [[Pilipinas News]] due to manpolling of its anchors like Cherie Mercado and Jove Francisco).\n\nOn October 21, 2014, ''Aksyon Prime'' cut its runtime to 45 minutes whenever [[2014\u201315 PBA season|PBA]] [[PBA on Sports5|games]] are at hand on weeknights. ''Reaksyon'' once again had a separate program after ''Aksyon Tonite''.\n\nOn November 3, 2014, Veteran [[war correspondent]] and [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] multimedia director Ed Lingao joins ''Aksyon Tonite'', replacing [[Paolo Bediones]], which left the newscast as effect of a video scandal while he was on [[GMA Network]]. Ed Lingao is previously with ABC/TV5 from 2004 \u2013 2009 as Head of News and as Contributor on Aksyon's predecessor, [[TEN: The Evening News]]. Ed Lingao's appearance was on a split screen, with Cheryl Cosim presenting from the studio while he is at the scene of the news on location. Andanar became also a temporary co-anchor with Cosim in ''Aksyon Tonite''. But during the coverage of [[Tropical Storm Fung-wong (2014)|Typhoon Mario (Fung-wong)]], Bediones, while being on a leave of absence, had an appearance on ''Aksyon Tonite'' and other ''Aksyon'' newscasts to give a report for Rescue5.\n\nPaolo Bediones joined ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' for a short period of time then later removed. However, the public service reminders from Rescue5 with Paolo Bediones were still being aired until his quiet unknown status with the network.\n\nIn January 2015, ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' shortened its airing time until 6:30 AM as the network expands its [[List of programs broadcast by The 5 Network#Cartoons|TV5 Kids]] block.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts including Aksyon News Alerts made history as they shifted to 16:9 high definition production, the first among the top three networks in the country. However, as major networks are initially testing digital terrestrial broadcasts at the time being, these newscasts are aired to viewers in a downgraded 4:3 standard definition letterbox (either on widescreen or CRT TVs).\n\nIn June 2015, all Aksyon Newscasts updated their graphic packages in full 16:9 presentation, which is currently used by major television networks in the US, Australia, most of Europe and other countries. The studio set was also renovated and expanded to accommodate an LED screen at the back of the studio with a desk for the anchor. This also the first time that ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' doesn't have a separate studio set.\n\nOn July 20, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts rescaled their graphics to allow TV5 to fit the newscast to the conventional 4:3 broadcast format. However, the letterboxing output shall remain to be used for some circumstances (such as events like the SONA where the originating source only applies to 16:9 widescreen TVs).\n\nAfter Shawn Yao's controversy on one of her live reports on TV and before anchoring a program on [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]], she left her segment in Aksyon and replaced permanently by MJ Marfori.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, Tulfo replaced Lourd de Veyra as one of the anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' Erwin and Martin's tandem in early morning television show made a return after ''Good Morning Sir''; their radio program ''Punto Asintado'' became a segment again in ''Aksyon Sa Umaga''. Erwin Tulfo is still one of the anchors of ''Aksyon Prime.''\n\nOn February 15, 2016, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' introduced ''Balitaserye,'' a five-minute crime investigation segments, anchored by Gary de Leon.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Cheryl Cosim and TV5's resident legal analyst Atty. Mel Sta. Maria replaced Martin Andanar and Erwin Tulfo as anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' This is Cheryl Cosim's return as a morning anchor/host after ''Good Morning Club'', though she still anchored ''Aksyon Tonite'' at that time''.'' This is also Atty. Mel Sta. Maria's first time to become a main anchor of a television newscast. Public service format was added on his arrival. Before this, he already became part of a segment in some newscasts of News5 where he gave similar advice to that which he gave on his radio program ''Relasyon.''\n\nIn April 2016, after many years of anchoring various newscasts, this is the first time that Martin Andanar doesn't have any television-produced programs except the continuous rerun of ''Crime Klasik'' and as host of ''Punto Asintado'' from Radyo5. He then focused on his radio and podcast career, while continuing his job as the official voice over of all News5 platforms: Radyo5, AksyonTV (except [[Sports5]] programs), N5E, and News5 programs on TV5. But in June 2016, it was revealed that Martin Andanar was appointed as the new head of [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)|PCOO]] (Presidential Communication Operations Office) under the Duterte Administration, which supervises the government's media infrastructure.\n\nIn May 2016, after the Bilang Pilipino 2016 Election Coverage, all Aksyon newscasts continued to utilize the new studio with a large LED. Unlike ABS-CBN News and GMA News who came back in their respective newscast studios after the coverage, News5 considered the Election studio as their new studio for all of its editions. However, 4:3 graphics, title cards, and OBB didn't change. There was also a time that [[Sports5]] used the studio for the announcement of the Gilas Pilipinas line-up prior to the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in July (with the Philippines as one of the host countries).\n\nOn July 15, 2016, [[Cherie Mercado]] left the newscast after six years with TV5 (from Aksyon Weekend, Aksyon JournalisMO, Pilipinas News, to Aksyon sa Tanghali), after she was appointed as the Press Officer and spokesperson to the newly created [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]].<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/BH3w3NpBe_j/]</ref><ref>[http://www.medianewser.com/2016/07/cherie-mercado-exits-tv5-to-become-new.html Cherie Mercado exits TV5 to become new spokesperson for DOTC]</ref> She, went to a private life with her family after resigning from her post in May the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/05/cherie-mercado-resigns-as-spokesperson.html#more|title=Cherie Mercado resigns as spokesperson of the Department of Transportation|last=|first=|date=May 19, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, she was hired by [[CNN Philippines]] (a local franchise of CNN which, ironically, became TV5's former partner in sharing international news content via AksyonTV's defunct ''CNN Konek'') to anchor the late evening edition of [[CNN Philippines Newsroom|Newsroom]], replacing Mitzi Borromeo who'll leave the channel to pursue an advance degree in college.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2018/01/cherie-mercado-joining-cnn-philippines.html|title=Former TV5 anchor Cherie Mercado joining CNN Philippines|last=|first=|date=January 22, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her departure, Aksyon was downgraded to single-presenter format by August 1. Cheryl Cosim retained her role to the morning newscast, but she left her co-presenter of ''Aksyon Tonite'' Ed Lingao who went solo for a week until Roices Naguit took over Cosim's vacated anchor's chair on the Late Night Edition in the height of the network's coverage to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. More than two months later, on October 17, the edition's segment anchor [[Lia Cruz]] and former Aksyon sa Tanghali segment anchor Marga Vargas are named as new rotating co-anchors to Lingao.<ref>[http://www.medianewser.com/2016/10/lia-cruz-and-marga-vargas-named-new-co.html Lia Cruz and Marga Vargas named new co-anchors of 'Aksyon Tonite']</ref> The primetime edition however, was spared from these changes and continued to be co-anchored by Valdez and Tulfo during the time.<ref>[http://www.medianewser.com/2016/07/first-on-mnp-tv5-to-switch-to-single.html First on MNP: TV5 to switch to single-anchor format]</ref>\n\nOn December 1, 2016, ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' began its simulcast on Radyo5 until 6:00 AM. The move was made after News5 axed Balita Alas Singko on weekdays which ended on November 30. However, the Saturday and Sunday editions of Balita Alas Singko still continues to air because it occupies both on Radyo5 and AksyonTV and considering to be the only news content of News5 on weekends. However, it cannot be seen on TV5 because of its radio booth format with no field reporters and video reports.\n\nBy December 19, 2016, the newscast's graphic package gained rounded edges (in exception in the flipper) with orange as the standard color.

Ed Lingao and Cheryl Cosim temporarily replaced Luchi Cruz-Valdes in the newscast. Cosim served as the main anchor of the primetime edition from its inception In 2010 until 2014. While Lingao is on the primetime edition, News5 correspondent Maricel Halili took Lingao's post as sit-in anchor for Aksyon Tonite.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, the newscast had a minor change on their studio set-up and a newsdesk, which was previously used by now-defunct News5 program ''[[Reaksyon]]''. The newscast also shares its set with ''[[SportsCenter Philippines]]'' of ESPN5 and ''The Big Story'' of [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]] (before it was moved to newly launched [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] studio as the newscast was relaunched in the news channel). Aksyon Tonite also moved its timeslot at 11:00 PM to also give way to the said sports newscast. The said edition also re-extended its broadcast by 15 minutes.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Aksyon Prime reduced airtime by 15 minutes on a PBA game day. This is due to adjustment of the PBA broadcast schedule which starts at 4:30 PM, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The runtime remains the same for the non-PBA game days.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the noontime and primetime edition began airing on weekday mornings at 5:00 AM as a replay telecast, serving as the morning timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga.\n\nDuring the third week of April, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' was given a Strong Parental Guidance (SPG) rating by the MTRCB due to its public service segments profane nature. The rating also includes the news segments of the said edition.\n\nOn July 2, 2018, after her almost 7 months of absence, ''Aksyon Prime'' main anchor Luchi Cruz-Valdes returns in the newscast, joining Ed Lingao, who serves as one of the sit-in presenters while she was on her leave. Meanwhile, another sit-in anchor Cheryl Cosim made a comeback to ''Aksyon Tonite'' as main anchor. Cosim permanently replaced Lingao, who also been her former co-anchor in the late-night edition.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, upon the rebranding of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], ''Aksyon Prime''<nowiki/>'s simulcast on the channel was axed to give way to the channel's repositioning as an all-sports channel. However, the audio simulcast on Radyo5 remains intact, with added TV presence on a standalone Cignal channel of the same name, which is also aired on selected UHF free TV stations run by the radio station's owner, [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\nOn February 11, 2019, Aksyon Tonite moved its timeslot at 10:30 PM, to give way for the special program as part of News5's coverage of the 2019 mid-term elections, ''Aplikante sa Senado''.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, Aksyon Primetime began simulcasting on '''One PH''', a \"teleradyo\" channel of Radyo5, on Cignal TV channel 6. Four days later, News5 announced that Aksyon Tonite will be replaced by a rebroadcast of ''[[The Big Story (TV program)|The Big Story]]'', the flagship newscast of 5's sister English news channel [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] starting March 4.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' began airing a replay once again at 6:15 AM every weekday morning. It serves as a replacement for the timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga and the ''Kids on 5'' block. The replay once again ended after a month. It was replaced by a simulcast of [[DWFM|Radyo5]]'s Morning Calls.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' re-extends its broadcast to 60 minutes during non-PBA game days. In accordance with the changes, ''Aksyon'' airs at 6:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Its PBA game day timeslot remains unchanged. These changes were brought about by 5's expansion of its news content through programs from sister station [[One PH]]; like its newscast service ''[[One Balita]]'' and late night talk show [[Radyo5 92.3 News FM|''Wag Po!'']]. Weeks prior to the change, Aksyon Prime had already reintroduced their online-only extension on ''News5 Always On''. Although, it is only aired on an occasional basis.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, ''Aksyon Prime'' was permanently moved to 6:30 PM five nights a week. This change happened days before the start of PBA's 45th season, which prompts Aksyon to start at 6:30 PM every Wednesday and Friday. Thus, it also allowed 5 to air an extended afternoon entertainment block on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, both editions of ''Aksyon'' were placed on hiatus to give way to the simulcast of [[One News (TV channel)|One News]] Now's special coverage on the Luzon quarantine due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n== Newscast editions ==\n\n===Aksyon (Primetime Edition)===\n\n==== Start time differences ====\nThe primetime edition is promoted to air at 6:30 PM on weeknights, with some exceptions.

Today]] |date=April 8, 2013 |accessdate=July 4, 2012 }}</ref> It currently consists of two editions: its main primetime edition, also known as '''''Aksyon Prime''''', broadcasts from 6:30 to 7:30 pm, [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], and is anchored by [[News5]] head [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]] and chief correspondent Ed Lingao, and its noontime public service and news edition, '''''Aksyon sa Tanghali''''' airs from 12:30 to 1:30 pm, [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], and is anchored by [[Raffy Tulfo]].\n\nAksyon formerly produced a morning newscast ('''Aksyon sa Umaga'''), a late night edition ('''Aksyon Tonite''') and weekend newscast ('''Aksyon Weekend''') as part of its integrated news platform adhering to the principle of 24/7 news monitoring and reporting.\n\nIts primetime edition is simulcast on a \"teleradyo\" basis through [[DWFM|92.3 News FM]] in [[Mega Manila]] and its provincial [[List of 5 (TV channel) TV and radio stations|Radyo5]] stations nationwide and tape-delayed on [[One PH]] weeknights at 8:00 PM.\n\nAll of its editions are aired overseas via [[Kapatid Channel]] and [[AksyonTV|AksyonTV International]].\n\nIt is the first-ever Philippine TV program that uses [[closed captioning]] (CC1), but only applies to live studio presentations (except live interviews).\n\n==Background==\nThe newscast is based on News5's slogan \"''Higit sa Balita, Aksyon''\", which literally means \"Beyond the news, Action\".\n\n==History==\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== As a primetime newscast (2010\u20132014) ===\n''Aksyon'' premiered on April 5, 2010 at 9:00 PM with [[Paolo Bediones]] and [[Cheryl Cosim]] as its first anchors. The news program used a touch-screen television called \"Aksyon Board.\" It is the first local newscast to report via Live-Pack in contrast to the [[Outside broadcasting|OB Vans]] used by its competitors. There is also a round-up news update called Aksyon Ngayon anchored by Dindo Flora, Cristina Lazo, and former [[DWRR-FM|Tambayan 101.9 (now MOR 101.9)]] DJ Reggie Valdez.\n\nOn October 25, 2010, [[Erwin Tulfo]] of the police-report-and-public-service-segment Aksyon Metro joined the newscast and their time slot was moved to 6:00 PM, then 5:45 PM, and then 5:30 PM serving as a former lead-in to the network's former variety shows ''[[Wil Time Bigtime|Willing Willie/Wil Time Bigtime]]''. On that same day, the newscast also introduced a new [[augmented virtuality]] set and OBB. Since November 8, 2010, the newscast began its simulcast on the newly launched [[DWFM|Radyo5 92.3 News FM]].\n\n<!-- Bediones was absent on his fixed last day on Aksyon - February 18. -->\nOn February 17, 2011, [[Paolo Bediones]] left the newscast for ''Aksyon JournalisMO'', leaving Cosim and Tulfo as the main anchors, with Shawn Yao (showbiz and weather) and Makata Tawanan (Makata's Super Bidyo) as segment anchors. The newscast was also given new weekday graphics and new virtual background while starting its simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] on February 21, 2011.\n\nOn June 6, 2011, the newscast added a news desk while updating their graphics and title card. \"Makata's Super Bidyo,\" a video features segment, was reformatted with its new name \"Makatang Gala\" (The Stray Poet), where Makata Tawanan goes on streets to bring information to its viewers. By July 25, 2011, [[Lourd de Veyra]] joined the newscast, hosting his weather-and-trivia-segment \"Weather or Not\", which includes relevant and historical bites after de Veyra presents the weather.\n\nOn February 6, 2012, Aksyon divided into two parts, Metro Aksyon focused on police reports around Metro Manila, and Rodolfo Jun Sabayton hosted \"Anong Problema Mo\", while remaining 30 minutes is the national and other news. It then became an emergency protocol when its former lead-in public service program, ''[[T3: Alliance|T3: Kapatid, Sagot Kita]]'', of the Tulfo brothers was given a long-term suspension by the [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]] following numerous controversies that hounded the show. By February 20, 2012, Aksyon modified its newsdesk and updating its graphics and title card.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Aksyon reexpand its time to 45 minutes, from 6:00 PM to 6:45 PM. It then launched a new segment entitled ''Happy News'', a segment that focuses on light-hearted topics (e.g., travel, food, festivals, etc.) that reflects the Filipino's happy spirit. It has become the newscast's closing segment since its launch.\n\nIn June 2013, when [[Sports5]] did not renew a blocktime agreement with [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] to air the [[AKTV]] sports block due to high blocktime costs and low ratings, the newscast's simulcast on [[AksyonTV]] was limited to give way for the primetime sports programming on AksyonTV.\n\nOn October 14, 2013, along with the launch of News5's primetime block '''KBO: Karunungan, Balita, Opinyon''', Aksyon updated its newsdesk, graphics and title card. later, Aksyon became a 1-hour newscast from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nOn December 23, 2013, Aksyon, along with other [[News5]] programs, transferred from its former TV5 Studio Complex in Novaliches, Quezon City to a larger [[TV5 Media Center]] in Reliance, [[Mandaluyong]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n5e.interaksyon.com/top/4EA1A901A12646E/1001/bagong-tahanan-ng-tv5-sa-mandaluyong-silipin|title= Bagong Tahanan ng TV5 sa Mandaluyong, Silipin|publisher=News5 Everywhere|accessdate= 21 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2014, the newscast has two new segments. Caught in Aksyon focuses on issues \u2013 accidents, violation, and wrongful activities caught on CCTV Cameras. ''Makatarugan Ba?'' is about the issues that one or more individuals has a violations in a law, as explained by Atty. Mel Sta. Maria.\n\n=== Expansion (2014\u20132017) ===\n\nOn July 21, 2014, \"Aksyon\" expanded its newscast by revamping four separate newscasts: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' (replacing [[Good Morning Club]]), ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' (the reincarnation of [[Balitaang Tapat]]) back-to-back with T3 Enforced (after moving to noontime slot), the reformatted flagship ''Aksyon Prime'', and ''Aksyon Tonite'' (replacing [[Pilipinas News]] due to manpolling of its anchors like Cherie Mercado and Jove Francisco).\n\nOn October 21, 2014, ''Aksyon Prime'' cut its runtime to 45 minutes whenever [[2014\u201315 PBA season|PBA]] [[PBA on Sports5|games]] are at hand on weeknights. ''Reaksyon'' once again had a separate program after ''Aksyon Tonite''.\n\nOn November 3, 2014, Veteran [[war correspondent]] and [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] multimedia director Ed Lingao joins ''Aksyon Tonite'', replacing [[Paolo Bediones]], which left the newscast as effect of a video scandal while he was on [[GMA Network]]. Ed Lingao is previously with ABC/TV5 from 2004 \u2013 2009 as Head of News and as Contributor on Aksyon's predecessor, [[TEN: The Evening News]]. Ed Lingao's appearance was on a split screen, with Cheryl Cosim presenting from the studio while he is at the scene of the news on location. Andanar became also a temporary co-anchor with Cosim in ''Aksyon Tonite''. But during the coverage of [[Tropical Storm Fung-wong (2014)|Typhoon Mario (Fung-wong)]], Bediones, while being on a leave of absence, had an appearance on ''Aksyon Tonite'' and other ''Aksyon'' newscasts to give a report for Rescue5.\n\nPaolo Bediones joined ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' for a short period of time then later removed. However, the public service reminders from Rescue5 with Paolo Bediones were still being aired until his quiet unknown status with the network.\n\nIn January 2015, ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' shortened its airing time until 6:30 AM as the network expands its [[List of programs broadcast by The 5 Network#Cartoons|TV5 Kids]] block.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts including Aksyon News Alerts made history as they shifted to 16:9 high definition production, the first among the top three networks in the country. However, as major networks are initially testing digital terrestrial broadcasts at the time being, these newscasts are aired to viewers in a downgraded 4:3 standard definition letterbox (either on widescreen or CRT TVs).\n\nIn June 2015, all Aksyon Newscasts updated their graphic packages in full 16:9 presentation, which is currently used by major television networks in the US, Australia, most of Europe and other countries. The studio set was also renovated and expanded to accommodate an LED screen at the back of the studio with a desk for the anchor. This also the first time that ''Aksyon Sa Umaga'' doesn't have a separate studio set.\n\nOn July 20, 2015, all Aksyon newscasts rescaled their graphics to allow TV5 to fit the newscast to the conventional 4:3 broadcast format. However, the letterboxing output shall remain to be used for some circumstances (such as events like the SONA where the originating source only applies to 16:9 widescreen TVs).\n\nAfter Shawn Yao's controversy on one of her live reports on TV and before anchoring a program on [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]], she left her segment in Aksyon and replaced permanently by MJ Marfori.\n\nOn January 18, 2016, Tulfo replaced Lourd de Veyra as one of the anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' Erwin and Martin's tandem in early morning television show made a return after ''Good Morning Sir''; their radio program ''Punto Asintado'' became a segment again in ''Aksyon Sa Umaga''. Erwin Tulfo is still one of the anchors of ''Aksyon Prime.''\n\nOn February 15, 2016, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' introduced ''Balitaserye,'' a five-minute crime investigation segments, anchored by Gary de Leon.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Cheryl Cosim and TV5's resident legal analyst Atty. Mel Sta. Maria replaced Martin Andanar and Erwin Tulfo as anchors/hosts of ''Aksyon sa Umaga.'' This is Cheryl Cosim's return as a morning anchor/host after ''Good Morning Club'', though she still anchored ''Aksyon Tonite'' at that time''.'' This is also Atty. Mel Sta. Maria's first time to become a main anchor of a television newscast. Public service format was added on his arrival. Before this, he already became part of a segment in some newscasts of News5 where he gave similar advice to that which he gave on his radio program ''Relasyon.''\n\nIn April 2016, after many years of anchoring various newscasts, this is the first time that Martin Andanar doesn't have any television-produced programs except the continuous rerun of ''Crime Klasik'' and as host of ''Punto Asintado'' from Radyo5. He then focused on his radio and podcast career, while continuing his job as the official voice over of all News5 platforms: Radyo5, AksyonTV (except [[Sports5]] programs), N5E, and News5 programs on TV5. But in June 2016, it was revealed that Martin Andanar was appointed as the new head of [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)|PCOO]] (Presidential Communication Operations Office) under the Duterte Administration, which supervises the government's media infrastructure.\n\nIn May 2016, after the Bilang Pilipino 2016 Election Coverage, all Aksyon newscasts continued to utilize the new studio with a large LED. Unlike ABS-CBN News and GMA News who came back in their respective newscast studios after the coverage, News5 considered the Election studio as their new studio for all of its editions. However, 4:3 graphics, title cards, and OBB didn't change. There was also a time that [[Sports5]] used the studio for the announcement of the Gilas Pilipinas line-up prior to the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in July (with the Philippines as one of the host countries).\n\nOn July 15, 2016, [[Cherie Mercado]] left the newscast after six years with TV5 (from Aksyon Weekend, Aksyon JournalisMO, Pilipinas News, to Aksyon sa Tanghali), after she was appointed as the Press Officer and spokesperson to the newly created [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]].<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/BH3w3NpBe_j/]</ref><ref>[http://www.medianewser.com/2016/07/cherie-mercado-exits-tv5-to-become-new.html Cherie Mercado exits TV5 to become new spokesperson for DOTC]</ref> She, went to a private life with her family after resigning from her post in May the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/05/cherie-mercado-resigns-as-spokesperson.html#more|title=Cherie Mercado resigns as spokesperson of the Department of Transportation|last=|first=|date=May 19, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, she was hired by [[CNN Philippines]] (a local franchise of CNN which, ironically, became TV5's former partner in sharing international news content via AksyonTV's defunct ''CNN Konek'') to anchor the late evening edition of [[CNN Philippines Newsroom|Newsroom]], replacing Mitzi Borromeo who'll leave the channel to pursue an advance degree in college.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2018/01/cherie-mercado-joining-cnn-philippines.html|title=Former TV5 anchor Cherie Mercado joining CNN Philippines|last=|first=|date=January 22, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her departure, Aksyon was downgraded to single-presenter format by August 1. Cheryl Cosim retained her role to the morning newscast, but she left her co-presenter of ''Aksyon Tonite'' Ed Lingao who went solo for a week until Roices Naguit took over Cosim's vacated anchor's chair on the Late Night Edition in the height of the network's coverage to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. More than two months later, on October 17, the edition's segment anchor [[Lia Cruz]] and former Aksyon sa Tanghali segment anchor Marga Vargas are named as new rotating co-anchors to Lingao.<ref>[http://www.medianewser.com/2016/10/lia-cruz-and-marga-vargas-named-new-co.html Lia Cruz and Marga Vargas named new co-anchors of 'Aksyon Tonite']</ref> The primetime edition however, was spared from these changes and continued to be co-anchored by Valdez and Tulfo during the time.<ref>[http://www.medianewser.com/2016/07/first-on-mnp-tv5-to-switch-to-single.html First on MNP: TV5 to switch to single-anchor format]</ref>\n\nOn December 1, 2016, ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' began its simulcast on Radyo5 until 6:00 AM. The move was made after News5 axed Balita Alas Singko on weekdays which ended on November 30. However, the Saturday and Sunday editions of Balita Alas Singko still continues to air because it occupies both on Radyo5 and AksyonTV and considering to be the only news content of News5 on weekends. However, it cannot be seen on TV5 because of its radio booth format with no field reporters and video reports.\n\nBy December 19, 2016, the newscast's graphic package gained rounded edges (in exception in the flipper) with orange as the standard color. It was initially used in the morning and early evening editions before implementing on the rest of the newscast. The color is now similar with their [[Cignal]] business channel [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]].\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Aksyon Prime extended its runtime every Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays to 75 minutes, with Aksyon sa Tanghali extending its runtime to a full hour seven days before the main edition. However, Aksyon Prime was scaled back to 60 minutes by February 23.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Erwin Tulfo and News5 management reached an agreement for the former to left Aksyon Prime, leaving his radio program Punto Asintado the remaining News5 program he hosted on, as well as occasional appearances with his brother [[Ben Tulfo]] for ''[[Kilos Pronto]]'' (a blocktime public-service show produced by ''Bitag Media'' for government-owned [[People's Television Network|PTV]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/first-on-mnp-erwin-tulfo-officially-out.html|title=First on MNP: Erwin Tulfo officially out as co-anchor of 'Aksyon'|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/tv5-president-and-ceo-chot-reyes-talks.html|title=TV5 President and CEO Chot Reyes talks about Erwin Tulfo's departure from 'Aksyon'|last=|first=|date=April 20, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=June 16, 2017}}</ref> Although personal concerns were the main reason for his departure to the newscast, several rumors have surrounded that it was due to his [[Duterte Diehard Supporters|strong opinion stance leaning towards]] President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], which was deemed sensitive to tackle for most Filipinos, particularly to members of the media (such as criticizing anti-Duterte supporter [[Jim Paredes]] on the DDS rally in Luneta during the 31st anniversary of [[People Power Revolution|EDSA I]] and Ed Lingao's criticisms to his opinion about opposition Sen.

As a compromise for the latter, however, News5 offered a separate online streaming on News5 Everywhere and News5's Facebook Live, where it can continue to run beyond its television broadcast. The said extension was discontinued months later.\n\n=== Reformat and major changes made by ESPN5's launch (2017\u2013present) ===\n\nNew soundtrack, openers, title cards and transition graphics (except Aksyon sa Umaga) were refreshed across all editions by August 14, 2017, replacing its 2014 version. The morning edition also replaced the AksyonTV theme with the new Aksyon soundtrack.\n\nOn September 4, 2017, Aksyon sa Umaga reduced its airtime from 75 minutes to 60 minutes to give way to some programming changes within the network.\n\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced its partnership agreement between the network and US-based sports television network [[ESPN]], who returned to Philippine television after a 5-year long hiatus. Thus the former Sports5 rebranded as ESPN5 a day after, during the coverage of Game 1 of the 2017 PBA Governor's Cup Finals between the [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel]] and the [[Meralco Bolts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE - TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|last=Bolante|first=Mikkel|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017|publisher=Interaksyon}}</ref> The new sports deal showed drastic changes within News5 and Aksyon: ''Aksyon sa Umaga'' was axed for good on November 3 to give way for the upcoming ESPN US' primetime programming simulcast overnight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/10/tv5-canceling-aksyon-sa-umaga-to-make-way-for-espn.html|title=TV5 canceling 'Aksyon sa Umaga' to make way for ESPN programs|last=|first=|date=October 20, 2017|website=www.medianewser.com|publisher=Media Newser Philippines|access-date=October 27, 2017}}</ref> This ended Cheryl Cosim's role as the main anchor of a News5 newscast after 7 years, although she continues radio duties at Radyo5 as well as filling-in for Cruz-Valdes on the primetime edition.

Ed Lingao and Cheryl Cosim temporarily replaced Luchi Cruz-Valdes in the newscast. Cosim served as the main anchor of the primetime edition from its inception In 2010 until 2014. While Lingao is on the primetime edition, News5 correspondent Maricel Halili took Lingao's post as sit-in anchor for Aksyon Tonite.\n\nOn December 11, 2017, the newscast had a minor change on their studio set-up and a newsdesk, which was previously used by now-defunct News5 program ''[[Reaksyon]]''. The newscast also shares its set with ''[[SportsCenter Philippines]]'' of ESPN5 and ''The Big Story'' of [[Bloomberg TV Philippines]] (before it was moved to newly launched [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] studio as the newscast was relaunched in the news channel). Aksyon Tonite also moved its timeslot at 11:00 PM to also give way to the said sports newscast. The said edition also re-extended its broadcast by 15 minutes.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Aksyon Prime reduced airtime by 15 minutes on a PBA game day. This is due to adjustment of the PBA broadcast schedule which starts at 4:30 PM, on Wednesdays and Fridays. The runtime remains the same for the non-PBA game days.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the noontime and primetime edition began airing on weekday mornings at 5:00 AM as a replay telecast, serving as the morning timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga.\n\nDuring the third week of April, ''Aksyon sa Tanghali'' was given a Strong Parental Guidance (SPG) rating by the MTRCB due to its public service segments profane nature. The rating also includes the news segments of the said edition.\n\nOn July 2, 2018, after her almost 7 months of absence, ''Aksyon Prime'' main anchor Luchi Cruz-Valdes returns in the newscast, joining Ed Lingao, who serves as one of the sit-in presenters while she was on her leave. Meanwhile, another sit-in anchor Cheryl Cosim made a comeback to ''Aksyon Tonite'' as main anchor. Cosim permanently replaced Lingao, who also been her former co-anchor in the late-night edition.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, upon the rebranding of [[AksyonTV]] to [[5 Plus]], ''Aksyon Prime''<nowiki/>'s simulcast on the channel was axed to give way to the channel's repositioning as an all-sports channel. However, the audio simulcast on Radyo5 remains intact, with added TV presence on a standalone Cignal channel of the same name, which is also aired on selected UHF free TV stations run by the radio station's owner, [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\nOn February 11, 2019, Aksyon Tonite moved its timeslot at 10:30 PM, to give way for the special program as part of News5's coverage of the 2019 mid-term elections, ''Aplikante sa Senado''.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, Aksyon Primetime began simulcasting on '''One PH''', a \"teleradyo\" channel of Radyo5, on Cignal TV channel 6. Four days later, News5 announced that Aksyon Tonite will be replaced by a rebroadcast of ''[[The Big Story (TV program)|The Big Story]]'', the flagship newscast of 5's sister English news channel [[One News (Philippines)|One News]] starting March 4.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' began airing a replay once again at 6:15 AM every weekday morning. It serves as a replacement for the timeslot formerly occupied by Aksyon sa Umaga and the ''Kids on 5'' block. The replay once again ended after a month. It was replaced by a simulcast of [[DWFM|Radyo5]]'s Morning Calls.\n\nOn September 23, 2019, ''Aksyon Prime'' re-extends its broadcast to 60 minutes during non-PBA game days. In accordance with the changes, ''Aksyon'' airs at 6:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Its PBA game day timeslot remains unchanged. These changes were brought about by 5's expansion of its news content through programs from sister station [[One PH]]; like its newscast service ''[[One Balita]]'' and late night talk show [[Radyo5 92.3 News FM|''Wag Po!'']]. Weeks prior to the change, Aksyon Prime had already reintroduced their online-only extension on ''News5 Always On''. Although, it is only aired on an occasional basis.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, ''Aksyon Prime'' was permanently moved to 6:30 PM five nights a week. This change happened days before the start of PBA's 45th season, which prompts Aksyon to start at 6:30 PM every Wednesday and Friday. Thus, it also allowed 5 to air an extended afternoon entertainment block on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, both editions of ''Aksyon'' were placed on hiatus to give way to the simulcast of [[One News (TV channel)|One News]] Now's special coverage on the Luzon quarantine due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].\n\n== Newscast editions ==\n\n===Aksyon (Primetime Edition)===\n\n==== Start time differences ====\nThe primetime edition is promoted to air at 6:30 PM on weeknights, with some exceptions. In almost every PBA game day, the newscast would start at or after 6:30 PM on 5 to allow the afternoon PBA game to end with the final score of the match. Start time is also subjected to change outside PBA games, only if necessary.\n\n====Main presenters====\n* [[Luchi Cruz-Valdes]] (2014\u2013present)\n* Ed Lingao (2017\u2013present)\n\n====Segment presenters====\n* [[Lourd de Veyra]] (2011\u2013present, ''Aksyon Weather'' and ''Word of the Lourd'')\n* MJ Marfori (2014\u2013present, ''Celebrity Aksyon'')\n* Lyn Olavario (2018\u2013present, ''SportsCenter sa Aksyon'')\n\n====Former main presenters====\n* [[Paolo Bediones]] (2010\u20132011)\n* [[Erwin Tulfo]] (2010\u20132017; moved to [[People's Television Network|PTV-4]], and [[Radyo Pilipinas]])\n* [[Cheryl Cosim]] (2010\u20132014; 2017\u20132018; now hosting One Balita Pilipinas for sister service Radyo5/One PH; substitute anchor for Luchi Cruz-Valdes)\n\n====Former segment presenters====\n* Paloma (2010\u20132011, ''Showbiz Aksyon'') \n* Shawn Yao (2011\u20132014, ''Showbiz Aksyon''; currently on [[One News (Philippines)|One News]])\n* Atty.

This edition always changes the schedule since the launch, due to blocktime programming or competing with other noontime newscasts. In 2018, it holds the reputation of being the only SPG-rated newscast in the country due to its public service format which they are featuring some sensitive complaints, and profanity which cannot be censored in a live program.

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the ''[[Parzival]]'' of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and its sequel ''[[Lohengrin]]'', itself inspired by the epic of ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''. It is part of the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend.\n\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] named his castle [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to compose, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]''.\n\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the [[Bridal Chorus]], better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\", often played as a processional at weddings in the West. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\n\n== Literary background ==\nThe literary figure of [[Lohengrin]] first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem [[Parzival]] of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the [[Grail King]] Parzival, is sent to the duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/13Jh/Wolfram/wol_pa16.html|title=Text from Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival, book XVI|website=bibliotheca Augustana|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between [[Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Age]] [[Christendom]] and [[Germanic paganism]]. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of [[Greek tragedy]] into the plot. He wrote the following in ''Mitteilungen an meine Freunde'' about his Lohengrin plans:<blockquote>Who doesn't know \"[[Zeus]] and [[Semele]]\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=334 |language=English Tr. William Ashton Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Composition ==\n''Lohengrin'' was written and composed between 1845-1848 when Wagner worked as Kappelmeister at the Royal Dresden court. The opera's genesis, however, starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty entitled ''Die Sarazein'' (The Saracen Woman) <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Projected or unfinished dramatic works |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=321 |chapter=The Music}}</ref> and, although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera, his attention was soon distracted by a [[Volksbuch]] that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist [[Das Judenthum in der Musik#Wagner and the Jews|Samuel Lehrs]]. The book in question was Ludwig Bechstein's 1835 anthology of legends ''Der Sagenchatz und die Sagenkreise des Th\u00fcringerlandes''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spencer |first1=Stewart |editor1-last=Grey |editor1-first=Thomas S. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Wagner |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-64439-6 |page=70 |chapter=Part II: Opera, music, drama - 4.

Andrew Gray |chapter=Part One: 1813-41}}</ref>\n\nSeeking a more authentic picture of the Tannh\u00e4user legend, Lehrs then provided Wagner with the annual proceedings of the K\u00f6nigsberg Germanic Society which not only included [[Christian Theodor Ludwig Lucas|C.T.L. Lucas]]'s critical study of the \"Wartburg war\" but also included a piece of criticism about the poem ''Lohengrin'', together with a lengthy narrative of the rambling epic's principal content. This, Wagner admits, with one blow a whole new world was opened to him,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=312 |language=English Tr.

In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapy visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind, Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by [[Joseph von G\u00f6rres]]. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn\u2019t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:\n\n<blockquote>Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armour at the centre of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to put down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Whittall |editor1-first=Mary |title=My Life |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-80481-6 |page=303 |language=English Tr. Andrew Gray |chapter=Part Two: 1842-50}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 3rd August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4th August 1845:\n\n<blockquote>...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full & detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. \u2026 the more familiar I have become with my new subject  & the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich & luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full & burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention & sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate & pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble & decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior & prosaic treatment of it, & to have restored it to its rich & highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness & reworking of it. - But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive & affecting in all its parts! - Johanna]'s role in it (Albert's daughter - see illustration below) - which is very important & in point of fact the principal role in the work - is bound to turn out the most charming & most moving in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of only two staves: one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second-draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second-draft of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9th September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts which along with the Prelude was completed on 29 August 1847. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Operas |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=284 |chapter=The Music}}</ref>\n\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second-draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist [[Hermann Franck]] regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa's punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa - a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |pages=333-334 |language=English Tr. William Ashton Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref> Elsa's punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: 'this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> Wagner confesses that Franck's concerns have forced him to look objectively at the poem and to consider ways of making Lohengrin's involvement in the tragic outcome clearer than had previously been the case. To this end, Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III:\n\nO Elsa! Was hast du mir angethan?<br>\nAls meine Augen dich zuerst ersah'n,<br>\nzu dir f\u00fchlt' ich in Liebe mich entbrannt,<br>\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft). \n\nLater, in the same Act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n\nNur eine Strafe giebt's f\u00fcr dein Vergeh'n<br>\nach, mich wie dich trifft ihre herbe Pein!<br>\nGetrennt, geschieden sollen wir uns seh'n<br>\ndiess muss die Strafe, diess die S\u00fchne sein!<br>\n\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner's opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail's advice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

The second complete draft of Act II was started on 18th June and complete on 2nd August 1847. In a letter to Ferdinand Heine dated 6 August 1847, Wagner announced that he had completed the ''Lohengrin'' opera:\n\n<blockquote>I feel pleased and happy as a result, since I am well satisfied with what I have done.</blockquote>\n\nAs outlined to Heine, Wagner's plan was to build on the success of the premiere of Rienzi in Berlin on 24 October 1847 with a follow up performance of ''Lohengrin''.

The composition is not divided into individual numbers but played from scene to scene without any interruption. This style of composition contrasts with the conventional [[number opera]], which is divided into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, and [[Choir|choral sections]]. Nevertheless, ''Lohengrin'' still contains lengthy performances\u2014for example, Elsa's \"Alone in dark days\" and Lohengrin's Grail aria\u2014which harken back to the classical solo aria form.\n\nWagner made extensive use of [[Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] in his composition. Examples include the Grail motif first revealed in the prelude and the \"question\" motif first sung by Lohengrin to Elsa in Act I. These motifs allowed Wagner to precisely narrate the inner thoughts of the characters on stage, even without speech.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe first production of ''Lohengrin'' was in [[Weimar]], Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Staatskapelle Weimar]] under the direction of [[Franz Liszt]], a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar's most famous citizen, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed., 1954</ref> Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor [[Karl Beck (tenor)|Karl Beck]],<ref>Wagner had written the act 3 tenor monologue ''In fernem Land'' (the \"Grail Narration\") in two parts, however, he asked Liszt to cut the second part from the premiere performance, as he felt Karl Beck could not do it justice and it would result in an anticlimax. That unfortunate circumstance established the tradition of performing only the first part of the Narration.(see [http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf Peter Bassett, \"An Introduction to Wagner's ''Lohengrin'': A paper given to the Patrons and Friends of Opera Australia\", Sydney 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410080312/http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }}) In fact, the first time the second part was ever sung at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] was by [[Franz V\u00f6lker]] during the lavish 1936 production, which [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered and took a close interest in, to demonstrate what a connoisseur of Wagner he was.

A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:Lohengrin - Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.png|thumb|upright|Illustration from the London premi\u00e8re]]\nKing [[Henry the Fowler]] has arrived in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate. The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through [[Trial by combat|ordeal by combat]]. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (Narrative: \"Alone in dark days\").\n\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this.\n\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God (\"Herr und Gott\") for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life. Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johanna Jachmann-Wagner]] as Ortrud, ca. 1860]]\n''Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral''\n\nTelramund and Ortrud, [[Deportation|banished]] from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] Duke of [[Frisia]]), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\n\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, [[Odin|Wodan]] and [[Freya|Freia]], for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\n\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an [[outlaw]] by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"[[Protectorate|Protector]] of Brabant\".<ref>The title ''F\u00fchrer'' von Brabant is often altered to ''Sch\u00fctzer'' in performances since 1945, because the former title has acquired meanings unforeseen by Wagner. ''F\u00fchrer'' formerly meant 'Leader' or 'Guide'.</ref> The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\n\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Omaraaslohengrin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph O'Mara]] in the title role, 1894\u20131895]]\n''Scene 1: The bridal chamber''\n\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known [[Bridal Chorus|bridal chorus]], and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\n''Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in Act 1)''\n\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the [[Holy Grail]] and of [[Monsalvat]]. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King [[Parsifal]], sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\n\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.\n\nA dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is stricken with grief and falls to the ground dead.<ref>Plot taken from ''The Opera Goer's Complete Guide'' by Leo Melitz, 1921 version.</ref>\n\n==Notable arias and excerpts==\n*Act 1\n**[[Prelude (music)|Prelude]]\n**\"{{Lang|de|Einsam in tr\u00fcben Tage|italic=no}}\" (Elsa's Narrative)\n**Scene \"{{Lang|de|Wenn ich im Kampfe f\u00fcr dich siege|italic=no}}\"\n* Act 2\n**\"{{Lang|de|Durch dich musst' ich verlieren|italic=no}}\" (Telramund)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Euch l\u00fcften, die mein Klagen|italic=no}}\" (Elsa)\n**Scene 4 opening, \"Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral\"\n* Act 3\n**Prelude\n**[[Bridal Chorus]] \"{{Lang|de|Treulich gef\u00fchrt|italic=no}}\"\n**\"{{Lang|de|Das s\u00fcsse Lied verhallt|italic=no}}\" (Love duet)\n**\"{{Lang|de|H\u00f6chstes Vertrau'n|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Declaration to Elsa)\n**Entry of King Henry\n**\"{{Lang|de|In fernem Land|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Narration)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Mein lieber Schwan...

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the ''[[Parzival]]'' of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and its sequel ''[[Lohengrin]]'', itself inspired by the epic of ''[[Garin le Loherain]]''. It is part of the [[Knight of the Swan]] legend.\n\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] named his castle [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to compose, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|The Ring of the Nibelung]]''.\n\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the [[Bridal Chorus]], better known as \"Here Comes the Bride\", often played as a processional at weddings in the West. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\n\n== Literary background ==\nThe literary figure of [[Lohengrin]] first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem [[Parzival]] of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the [[Grail King]] Parzival, is sent to the duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/germanica/Chronologie/13Jh/Wolfram/wol_pa16.html|title=Text from Wolfram von Eschenbach: Parzival, book XVI|website=bibliotheca Augustana|access-date=2016-05-22}}</ref> Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between [[Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Age]] [[Christendom]] and [[Germanic paganism]]. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of [[Greek tragedy]] into the plot. He wrote the following in ''Mitteilungen an meine Freunde'' about his Lohengrin plans:<blockquote>Who doesn't know \"[[Zeus]] and [[Semele]]\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |page=334 |language=English Tr.

The opera's genesis however starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty entitled ''Die Sarazein'' (The Saracen Woman) <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Projected or unfinished dramatic works |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=321 |chapter=The Music}}</ref> and although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera his attention was soon distracted by a [[Volksbuch]] that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist [[Das Judenthum in der Musik#Wagner and the Jews|Samuel Lehrs]].

In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapy visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of the utmost leisure, and he had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by [[Joseph von G\u00f6rres]]. His plan to lie beside a brook communing with Titurel and Parzival didn\u2019t last long and the longing to create was overpowering:\n\n<blockquote>Lohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armour at the centre of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to put down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Whittall |editor1-first=Mary |title=My Life |date=1992 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-80481-6 |page=303 |language=English Tr. Andrew Gray |chapter=Part Two: 1842-50}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 3rd August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner, with his head in a whirl, wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4th August 1845\n\n<blockquote>...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full & detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. \u2026 the more familiar I have become with my new subject  & the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich & luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full & burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention & sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate & pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble & decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior & prosaic treatment of it, & to have restored it to its rich & highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness & reworking of it. - But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive & affecting in all its parts! - Johanna]'s role in it (Albert's daughter - see illustration below) - which is very important & in point of fact the principal role in the work - is bound to turn out the most charming & most moving in the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 70}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of only two staves, one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Coterminously, Wagner began work on a second-draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second-drafts of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9th September 1846 Wagner began to elaborate the instrumental and choral parts which along with the Prelude was completed on 29 August 1847. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Millington |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Millington |editor1-first=Barry |editor1-link=Operas |title=The Wagner Compendium |date=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=284 |chapter=The Music}}</ref>\n\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second-draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist [[Hermann Franck]] regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa's punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa - a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richards |title=The Art-Work of the Future and Other Works |date=1993 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |isbn=0-8032-9752-1 |pages=333-334 |language=English Tr. William Ashton Ellis |chapter=A Communication To My Friends}}</ref> Elsa's punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: 'this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

Stewart Spencer and Barry Millington |chapter=Letter 75}}</ref> Wagner confesses that Franck's concerns have forced him to look objectively at the poem and to consider ways of making Lohengrin's involvement in the tragic outcome clearer than had previously been the case. To this end Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III,\n\nO Elsa! Was hast du mir angethan?<br>\nAls meine Augen dich zuerst ersah'n,<br>\nzu dir f\u00fchlt' ich in Liebe mich entbrannt,<br>\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft). \n\nLater, in the same Act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n\nNur eine Strafe giebt's f\u00fcr dein Vergeh'n<br>\nach, mich wie dich trifft ihre herbe Pein!<br>\nGetrennt, geschieden sollen wir uns seh'n<br>\ndiess muss die Strafe, diess die S\u00fchne sein!<br>\n\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner's opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail's advice.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wagner |first1=Richard |editor1-last=Spencer |editor1-first=Stewart |editor2-last=Millington |editor2-first=Barry |title=Selected Letters of Richard Wagner with original texts of passages omitted from existing printed editions |date=1987 |publisher=J.

The composition is not divided into individual numbers but played from scene to scene without any interruption. This style of composition contrasts with the conventional [[number opera]], which is divided into [[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, and [[Choir|choral sections]]. Nevertheless, ''Lohengrin'' still contains lengthy performances\u2014for example, Elsa's \"Alone in dark days\" and Lohengrin's Grail aria\u2014which harken back to the classical solo aria form.\n\nWagner made extensive use of [[Leitmotif|leitmotifs]] in his composition. Examples include the Grail motif first revealed in the prelude and the \"question\" motif first sung by Lohengrin to Elsa in Act I. These motifs allowed Wagner to precisely narrate the inner thoughts of the characters on stage, even without speech.\n\n== Performance history ==\nThe first production of ''Lohengrin'' was in [[Weimar]], Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Staatskapelle Weimar]] under the direction of [[Franz Liszt]], a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar's most famous citizen, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who was born on 28 August 1749.<ref>''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed., 1954</ref> Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor [[Karl Beck (tenor)|Karl Beck]],<ref>Wagner had written the act 3 tenor monologue ''In fernem Land'' (the \"Grail Narration\") in two parts, however, he asked Liszt to cut the second part from the premiere performance, as he felt Karl Beck could not do it justice and it would result in an anticlimax. That unfortunate circumstance established the tradition of performing only the first part of the Narration.(see [http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf Peter Bassett, \"An Introduction to Wagner's ''Lohengrin'': A paper given to the Patrons and Friends of Opera Australia\", Sydney 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410080312/http://www.peterbassett.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/An-introduction-to-Lohengrin.pdf |date=2013-04-10 }}) In fact, the first time the second part was ever sung at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] was by [[Franz V\u00f6lker]] during the lavish 1936 production, which [[Adolf Hitler]] personally ordered and took a close interest in, to demonstrate what a connoisseur of Wagner he was.

A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:Lohengrin - Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.png|thumb|upright|Illustration from the London premi\u00e8re]]\nKing [[Henry the Fowler]] has arrived in [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\n\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate. The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through [[Trial by combat|ordeal by combat]]. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (Narrative: \"Alone in dark days\").\n\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this.\n\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God (\"Herr und Gott\") for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life. Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Johanna Jachmann-Wagner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johanna Jachmann-Wagner]] as Ortrud, ca. 1860]]\n''Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral''\n\nTelramund and Ortrud, [[Deportation|banished]] from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of [[Radbod, King of the Frisians|Radbod]] Duke of [[Frisia]]), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\n\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, [[Odin|Wodan]] and [[Freya|Freia]], for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\n\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an [[outlaw]] by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"[[Protectorate|Protector]] of Brabant\".<ref>The title ''F\u00fchrer'' von Brabant is often altered to ''Sch\u00fctzer'' in performances since 1945, because the former title has acquired meanings unforeseen by Wagner. ''F\u00fchrer'' formerly meant 'Leader' or 'Guide'.</ref> The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\n\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Omaraaslohengrin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph O'Mara]] in the title role, 1894\u20131895]]\n''Scene 1: The bridal chamber''\n\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known [[Bridal Chorus|bridal chorus]], and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\n''Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in Act 1)''\n\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the [[Holy Grail]] and of [[Monsalvat]]. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King [[Parsifal]], sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\n\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.\n\nA dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is stricken with grief and falls to the ground dead.<ref>Plot taken from ''The Opera Goer's Complete Guide'' by Leo Melitz, 1921 version.</ref>\n\n==Notable arias and excerpts==\n*Act 1\n**[[Prelude (music)|Prelude]]\n**\"{{Lang|de|Einsam in tr\u00fcben Tage|italic=no}}\" (Elsa's Narrative)\n**Scene \"{{Lang|de|Wenn ich im Kampfe f\u00fcr dich siege|italic=no}}\"\n* Act 2\n**\"{{Lang|de|Durch dich musst' ich verlieren|italic=no}}\" (Telramund)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Euch l\u00fcften, die mein Klagen|italic=no}}\" (Elsa)\n**Scene 4 opening, \"Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral\"\n* Act 3\n**Prelude\n**[[Bridal Chorus]] \"{{Lang|de|Treulich gef\u00fchrt|italic=no}}\"\n**\"{{Lang|de|Das s\u00fcsse Lied verhallt|italic=no}}\" (Love duet)\n**\"{{Lang|de|H\u00f6chstes Vertrau'n|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Declaration to Elsa)\n**Entry of King Henry\n**\"{{Lang|de|In fernem Land|italic=no}}\" (Lohengrin's Narration)\n**\"{{Lang|de|Mein lieber Schwan...
