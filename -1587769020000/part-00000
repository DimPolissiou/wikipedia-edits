As of 2010, the population was estimated to be 33,771.<ref name=\"United States Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3979002|title=QuickFacts: Upper Arlington, City|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Census|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land on which present-day Upper Arlington sits was first known to be inhabited by the [[Adena culture|Adena people]], renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres of land, south of present-day Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).

Park facilities include playgrounds, sports fields, shelters and picnic areas, walking paths, fitness trails and wooded areas. In addition, the City owns and operates three outdoor community swimming pools \u2013 Tremont Pool, Devon Pool, and the Reed Road Water Park \u2013 which are open Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upperarlingtonoh.gov/|title=City of Upper Arlington \u2013 Cherished Past &#9733 Golden Future|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Upper Arlington Public Library ==\nThe Upper Arlington Public Library system comprises the Main Library, a 60,000 square foot facility located on Tremont Road near the geographic center of the city, the 10,000 square foot Lane Road Branch, approximately three miles to the north, and the 4,400 square foot Miller Park Branch, one and one half miles south near the center of Old Arlington. Prior to 1967, the libraries in Upper Arlington were branches of the Grandview Heights Public Library. After circulation at the Upper Arlington branches surpassed their parent library, Mayor John Dunkel spearheaded an effort to challenge a law prohibiting new library systems in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualibrary.org/|title=Upper Arlington Public Library|website=Upper Arlington Public Library|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> Thanks to his perseverance, the Ohio General Assembly passed Ohio House Bill No. 494 in 1967, allowing Upper Arlington to independently establish and govern its own library system. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2017, the Upper Arlington Library System is considered a community jewel, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and fellowship.\n\n==Sister city==\nThe city is sister cities with [[St. Andrews]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[John W.

As of 2010, the population was estimated to be 33,771.<ref name=\"United States Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/3979002|title=QuickFacts: Upper Arlington, City|last=|first=|date=|website=United States Census|publisher=United States Government|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe land on which present-day Upper Arlington sits was first known to be inhabited by the [[Adena culture|Adena people]], renowned for building conical mounds for burial sites. Centuries later the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] lived there, eventually being expelled after the U.S. Government gave land grants to Revolutionary War soldiers in lieu of pay. Property originally bestowed in this area to Elijah Backus, [[Jonathan Dayton]] and Andrew Marker was sold as farm property to a number of different families in the 1800s.\n\nBrothers and real estate developers King and Ben Thompson founded Upper Arlington. They purchased the original 840 acres, land south of the current Lane Avenue, from James T. Miller in 1913. It was directly adjacent to the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] They first referred to the area as the \"Country Club District\" modeled after the Country Club development in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], but by 1917 the community became known as \"Upper Arlington\" in reference to its southern neighbor of Arlington (now known as [[Marble Cliff]]). The Upper Arlington Company was incorporated that year and by 1920 operated out of a field office built in Miller Park; that building also served as a street-car shelter house and is presently the Miller Park branch of the Upper Arlington Library.\n\nThe development proceeded according to the [[Garden city movement|Garden City]]\u2013inspired plan by [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] William Pitkin, Jr., which called for following the contours of the land to form curving streets copiously lined with trees rather than a gridded street layout. This design style gave the oldest district in Upper Arlington (at its southernmost end) its distinctively pleasant, park-like feel, featuring numerous small green spaces.\n\nIn 1916, the development was interrupted when the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] used the area as a temporary training camp called Camp Willis after Ohio's [[Governor of Ohio|governor]] at the time, [[Frank B. Willis]]. Thousands of servicemen were trained at Camp Willis and then dispatched against [[Pancho Villa]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. The camp was dismantled by September 1916. Development resumed shortly afterwards, and on March 20, 1918, Upper Arlington incorporated as a village with a population of 200. James T. Miller, the original landowner, served as the first mayor. The Mallway business district, which was constructed in the 1920s, was the first commercial district in Upper Arlington.\n\nMany restrictions existed as Upper Arlington developed. Some of these involved creating open, green spaces, maintenance of parks, generous setbacks ensuring large front and corner lawns, and carefully controlled development of separate areas for businesses and multi-family housing. From 1920 to 1945, the city enforced racially restrictive covenants in property deeds. From 1930 to 1945, 77.3% of the 22 new subdivisions built in the Columbus, Ohio area either explicitly prohibited African Americans or permitted only whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krueckeberg|first=Donald A.|date=January 1996|title=Reviews : Planning for the Private Interest: Land Use Controls and Residential Patterns in Columbus, Ohio, 1900-1970.

Most annexation occurred in the late 1940s through 1960. The two largest annexations occurred in 1954 and 1955, by which the city nearly doubled its surface area. Henderson Road has been Upper Arlington's northern border since 1969.\n\nThe annexed property was part of Perry Township, which had been home to numerous farm residents and their families in the 1800s. One such resident was Pleasant Litchford, a former slave who migrated north after buying his freedom, and who became a notable citizen in the African-American community. The current high school sits on property owned by Pleasant Litchford until his death in 1879. The property was annexed into Upper Arlington in the 1950s.\n\nOther Perry Township farming family names from the 1800s include Kennedy, Kenny, Legg, and Trapp. The McCoy, Richards, Lakin, Matthews, Delashmutt, Phenegar, Slyh, Zollinger, Bickett, Wills and Walcutt families were connected in some way by marriage and have descendants living in Upper Arlington. Richards and McCoy family reunions were held for decades; their first was in 1895, with 109 in attendance.\n[[File:Founding Families.jpg|left|thumb|Richards & McCoy Reunion]]\n\nThe post\u2013[[World War II]] housing boom led to the development of many new housing tracts north of Lane Avenue. The newer developments took on a much different character from the older core of the city, being mostly organized along normal street grids and with classic [[ranch-style house]]s like those found in the area called River Ridge. By the 1960s, as the city grew north, the houses were larger and the neighborhoods more consistent with the intent, if not style, of the original section south of Lane Avenue. The southern half of the city, designated as the \"Upper Arlington Historic District\" (or colloquially \"Old Arlington\" or \"South of Lane\"), was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1985.\n\n==Geography==\nUpper Arlington is bordered on the west by the [[Scioto River]], on the north and east by Columbus, and on the south by [[Marble Cliff, Ohio|Marble Cliff]] and [[Grandview Heights, Ohio|Grandview Heights]]. The [[Olentangy River]] and the main campus of the [[Ohio State University]] are a short distance to the east of Upper Arlington. Downtown Columbus lies to the southeast, its skyline visible across the OSU farmland research facilities extending along Upper Arlington's eastern border.\n\nThe city is around 800&nbsp;ft elevation located between the Olentangy and Scioto rivers. Two ravines cut through the city. The Slate Run in the northwest corner flows into the [[Scioto River]]. However, the Turkey Run is longer. It originates in the north then runs southwards until it makes an eastward bend around Reed Rd. Then, it flows eastwards through the OSU Golf Course. The run is used as a storm drain at points, has been dammed in the Ohio State course and runs through concrete pipes at two points. The soil is [[Till|glacial till]] and is suitable for agriculture, supporting a research farm operated by [[The Ohio State University]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|9.87|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.84|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 620\n|1930= 3059\n|1940= 5370\n|1950= 9024\n|1960= 28486\n|1970= 38727\n|1980= 35648\n|1990= 34128\n|2000= 33686\n|2010= 33771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=35522\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref name=Census1930>{{cite web|title=Population: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=1930 US Census|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the 2010 census, the population was 33,771 persons, 16,157 male (47.84%) and 17,614 female (52.16%).

The building, which terminates the mallway at the center of the Historic District, was designed by [[Ohio Stadium]] architect [[Howard Dwight Smith]] and served as the first permanent school in Upper Arlington upon its completion in 1924.]]\nThe [[Upper Arlington City School District]] serves the entire municipality. As of 2000, the Upper Arlington Board of Education was the city's largest employer. The district provides an early education school, five elementary schools, two middle schools, and a high school. Burbank Early Education School serves students before the elementary level and was created during a period when the population demanded fewer elementary buildings. The district offers an optional [[Alternative education|informal/progressive style of education]] through Wickliffe Elementary and Barrington Elementary in addition to conventional program. Other elementary schools include Greensview, Tremont and Windermere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaschools.org/|title=Upper Arlington City Schools|website=www.uaschools.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nHastings Middle School was built in the 1960s and serves the northern area of the district. Jones Middle School is located in the former high school building that was also the site of the Willis National Guard Camp and serves the southern portion. [[Upper Arlington High School (Ohio)|Upper Arlington High School]] serves students from the entire district and boasts membership in the [[International Baccalaureate]] program. The Upper Arlington High School mascot is the Golden Bear, which became the nickname of professional golfer [[Jack Nicklaus]], an alumnus of the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaschools.org/|title=Upper Arlington City Schools|website=www.uaschools.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\nAlso in the city are a private K-12 school, The [[Wellington School, The (Columbus, Ohio)|Wellington School]] and two [[Catholic school|Catholic grade schools]]\u2014St. Agatha and St. Andrew. Both St. Agatha and St. Andrew offer K-8 programs and preschool childcare centers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaschools.org/|title=Upper Arlington City Schools|website=www.uaschools.org|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\nThe City of Upper Arlington operates under the Council/Manager form of government\u2014a system of representative democracy that combines the policy-setting leadership of elected officials with the strong managerial experience of an appointed manager. The City Council is elected by citizens and then hires a professional City Manager to run day-to-day operations and implement policy passed by Council.\n\nUpper Arlington's Community Development Department coordinates the many aspects involved in the City's growth, development and preservation Building, Planning and Property Maintenance divisions, with development projects guided and served by an award-winning, streamlined review and zoning process. An Economic Development Division provides a range of services to help existing, new and expanding businesses grow and be successful in the community while diversifying and expanding the range of businesses, and amenities available to residents and strengthening the tax base. The Engineering Division manages the City's public infrastructure\u2014such as roads, waterlines, sanitary and storm sewer systems, and public right-of-way\u2014with a 10-year Capital Improvement Program in place to ensure proactive reinvestment in these critical community assets. The Public Works Division focuses on vital services that keep motorists traveling safely within our community throughout the seasons, including minor road repairs, street cleaning, snow removal and leaf collection.\n\nThe City is always looking for innovative ways to bring the best care and public safety to the community. This is done through a variety of services including: CARES, Bike Helmets for Kids, Blood Pressure Checks, CPR Training, and Safe Baby Training. Upper Arlington's Fire Division also staffs all medic trucks with at least two paramedics and all fire apparatus with at least one paramedic at all times. The Police Division provides 24-hour service and is an integral part of developing and maintaining a safe and secure community.\n\nThe Parks & Recreation Department fulfills the recreational, cultural and educational needs of the community through an exciting array of programs and activities, as well as maintaining the City's beautiful parks, street trees and other public spaces. They offer programs and activities for youth, adult and senior adults varying from cultural arts, aquatics and tennis, culinary and crafts.\n\nUpper Arlington oversees and maintains 21 parks covering approximately 186 acres. Park facilities include playgrounds, sports fields, shelters and picnic areas, walking paths, fitness trails and wooded areas. In addition, the City owns and operates three outdoor community swimming pools \u2013 Tremont Pool, Devon Pool, and the Reed Road Water Park \u2013 which are open Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upperarlingtonoh.gov/|title=City of Upper Arlington \u2013 Cherished Past &#9733 Golden Future|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Upper Arlington Public Library ==\nThe Upper Arlington Public Library system comprises the Main Library, a 60,000 square foot facility located on Tremont Road near the geographic center of the city, the 10,000 square foot Lane Road Branch, approximately three miles to the north, and the 4,400 square foot Miller Park Branch, one and one half miles south near the center of Old Arlington. Prior to 1967, the libraries in Upper Arlington were branches of the Grandview Heights Public Library. After circulation at the Upper Arlington branches surpassed their parent library, Mayor John Dunkel spearheaded an effort to challenge a law prohibiting new library systems in Ohio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualibrary.org/|title=Upper Arlington Public Library|website=Upper Arlington Public Library|language=en|access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref> Thanks to his perseverance, the Ohio General Assembly passed Ohio House Bill No. 494 in 1967, allowing Upper Arlington to independently establish and govern its own library system. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2017, the Upper Arlington Library System is considered a community jewel, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and fellowship.\n\n==Sister city==\nThe city is sister cities with [[St. Andrews]], [[Scotland]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[John W.
