In [[Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and [[centre-right politics]].\n\n==Overview, definitions and usage==\nBoth \"[[conservatism]]\" and \"[[liberalism]]\" have had different meanings over time in different centuries. The term \"liberal conservatism\" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with \"[[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] conservatism\", which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]), the term \"liberal conservatism\" came to be understood simply as \"conservatism\" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values to call themselves \"[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]\" instead.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.</ref> However, there are differences between classical liberals and libertarians.{{sfn|van de Haar|2015|p=71}}\n\nNevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112</ref> However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a \"hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism\") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C |title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different |first1=Adrian |last1=Wooldridge |first2=John |last2=Micklethwait |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |via=Google Books |isbn=9780241958896}}</ref> Consequently, in the United States the term \"liberal conservatism\" is not used. American \"[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]\" happens to be quite different from [[Liberalism in Europe|European liberalism]] and occupies the [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centrism|centre]] and [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] while [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.<ref>Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.</ref>\n\nFor their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles, European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those holding [[national conservatism|national conservative]], fully [[social conservatism|social-conservative]] and/or outright [[populism|populist]] views, let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Being liberal often involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} Compared to other centre-right political traditions, such as [[Christian democracy]], liberal conservatives are less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome regional varieties and peculiarities can be observed:\n* In much of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, as well as the United Kingdom and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberal conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals (including [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberals]]).\n* In most [[Nordic countries]], liberal conservatives, Christian democrats and liberals form distinct political families and have each their own party.\n* In most countries where [[Romance languages]] are spoken and where [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is or has been dominant, as well as in [[Greece]], liberal conservative movements, often encompassing Christian democrats and liberals,  have more recently gained traction and the terms \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" may be understood as synonymous.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nConsequently, at the European level, Christian democrats and most liberal conservatives are affiliated to the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), while liberals (including conservative and social liberals) to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (ALDE Party).\n\nIn this context, some traditionally Christian-democratic parties (such as [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] in Belgium, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] in [[Austria]]) have become almost undistinguishable from other liberal-conservative parties. On the other hand, newer liberal-conservative parties (such as [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] in Greece, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] in [[Portugal]], [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in [[Spain]], [[Forza Italia]] / [[The People of Freedom]] / [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] in [[Italy]], the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] / [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in [[France]] and most centre-right parties from countries once belonging to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]]) have not adopted traditional labels, but their ideologies are also a mixture of conservatism, Christian democracy and liberalism.\n\nIn the modern European discourse, \"liberal conservatism\" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and [[environmentalism]] (see also [[green conservatism]] and [[green liberalism]]). This variety of \"liberal conservatism\" has been espoused by Nordic conservatives (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have been fending off competition from right-wing populists to their right and do not include Christian democrats, and, at times, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010, [[David Cameron]] introduced himself a \"liberal conservative\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=David |title=I am a Liberal Conservative |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=18 August 2012 |date=2010-05-16}}</ref> During his first speech to a party conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of \"grand schemes to remake the world\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm \"Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference\"], BBC, October 2006</ref>\n\n==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]\nHistorically, in the 18th and 19th centuries \"[[conservatism]]\" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous \"[[liberalism]]\" \u2013 now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] \u2013 advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].\n\n[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]\nAccording to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is \"economics is prior to politics\".<ref name=vincent>{{cite book |last=Vincent |first=Andrew |title=Modern Political Ideologies |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],<ref>Lakoff, Sandoff, \"Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism.\" ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435\u2013464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}</ref> as the basis of current liberal conservatism, as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]]. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] \u2013 without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term \"liberal\" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties |title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |pages=106\u2013108 |isbn=9780313391828 |last1=Slomp |first1=Hans |date=2011-09-26}}</ref> Australia<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goldfarb |first1=Michael |title=Liberal?

[[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on economic, social and ethical issues,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}</ref> or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.\n\nLiberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the [[Market (economics)|market]] and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} They also support [[civil liberties]], along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions. In [[Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and [[centre-right politics]].\n\n==Overview, definitions and usage==\nBoth \"[[conservatism]]\" and \"[[liberalism]]\" have had different meanings over time in different centuries. The term \"liberal conservatism\" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with \"[[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] conservatism\", which deems the principle of equality as something discordant with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]), the term \"liberal conservatism\" came to be understood simply as \"conservatism\" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values to call themselves \"[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]\" instead.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.</ref> However, there are differences between classical liberals and libertarians.{{sfn|van de Haar|2015|p=71}}\n\nNevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.<ref>Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112</ref> However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a \"hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism\") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books|isbn=9780241958896}}</ref> Consequently, in the United States the term \"liberal conservatism\" is not used. American \"[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]\" happens to be quite different from [[Liberalism in Europe|European liberalism]] and occupies the [[centre-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centrism|centre]] and [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] while [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.<ref>Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.</ref>\n\nFor their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles, European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those holding [[national conservatism|national conservative]], fully [[social conservatism|social-conservative]] and/or outright [[populism|populist]] views, let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. Being liberal often involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} Compared to other centre-right political traditions, such as [[Christian democracy]], liberal conservatives are less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]], favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome regional varieties and peculiarities can be observed:\n* In much of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, as well as the United Kingdom and [[Belgium]], a divide persists between liberal conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals (including [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberals]] and [[Social liberalism|social liberals]]).\n* In most [[Nordic countries]], liberal conservatives, Christian democrats and liberals form distinct political families and have each their own party.\n* In most countries where [[Romance languages]] are spoken and where [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is or has been dominant, as well as in [[Greece]], liberal conservative movements, often encompassing Christian democrats and liberals,  have more recently gained traction and the terms \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" may be understood as synonymous.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nConsequently, at the European level, Christian democrats and most liberal conservatives are affiliated to the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), while liberals (including conservative and social liberals) to the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] (ALDE Party).\n\nIn this context, some traditionally Christian-democratic parties (such as [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian-Democratic and Flemish]] in Belgium, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Austrian People's Party|People's Party]] in [[Austria]]) have become almost undistinguishable from other liberal-conservative parties. On the other hand, newer liberal-conservative parties (such as [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] in Greece, the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] in [[Portugal]], [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] in [[Spain]], [[Forza Italia]] / [[The People of Freedom]] / [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] in [[Italy]], the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] / [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in [[France]] and most centre-right parties from countries once belonging to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Yugoslavia]]) have not adopted traditional labels, but their ideologies are also a mixture of conservatism, Christian democracy and liberalism.\n\nIn the modern European discourse, \"liberal conservatism\" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and [[environmentalism]] (see also [[green conservatism]] and [[green liberalism]]). This variety of \"liberal conservatism\" has been espoused by Nordic conservatives (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have been fending off competition from right-wing populists to their right and do not include Christian democrats, and, at times, the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. In an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010, [[David Cameron]] introduced himself a \"liberal conservative\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=2010-05-16}}</ref> During his first speech to a party conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of \"grand schemes to remake the world\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm \"Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference\"], BBC, October 2006</ref>\n\n==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]\nHistorically, in the 18th and 19th centuries \"[[conservatism]]\" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous \"[[liberalism]]\" \u2013 now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] \u2013 advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].\n\n[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]\nAccording to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is \"economics is prior to politics\".<ref name=vincent>{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],<ref>Lakoff, Sandoff, \"Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism.\" ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435\u2013464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}</ref> as the basis of current liberal conservatism, as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]]. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] \u2013 without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term \"liberal\" is used to describe those with free market economic views.

An immense [[Fugue#Double (triple, quadruple) fugue|double fugue]], it was universally condemned by contemporary music critics. A reviewer writing for the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' in 1826 described the fugue as \"incomprehensible, like Chinese\" and \"a confusion of Babel\".<ref>Solomon (2003), p. 35</ref> However, critical opinion of the work has risen steadily since the beginning of the 20th century, and it is now considered among Beethoven's greatest achievements. [[Igor Stravinsky]] described it as \"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever.\"<ref>Stravinsky and Craft (1963), p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' originally served as the final movement of his [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Quartet No. 13 in B{{music|flat}} major]] (Op. 130), written in 1825. But Beethoven's publisher, who was concerned about the dismal commercial prospects of the piece, urged Beethoven to replace the fugue with a new finale. Beethoven complied, and the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' was published separately in 1827 as Op. 133. It was composed when Beethoven was almost completely deaf, and is considered to be part of his set of [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late quartets]]. It was first performed in 1826, as the finale of the B{{music|flat}} quartet, by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]].\n\nMusic analysts and critics have described the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' as \"inaccessible\",<ref>B.H.

His choice of a fugal form for the last movement was well grounded in tradition: [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and Beethoven himself had previously used fugues as final movements of quartets. But in recent years, Beethoven had become increasingly concerned with the challenge of integrating this Baroque form into the Classical structure. \"In my student days I wrote dozens of [fugues] ... but [imagination] also wishes to exert its privileges ... and a new and really poetic element must be introduced into the traditional form,\" Beethoven wrote.<ref>[[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]]: ''Ludwig van Beethovens Leben''. quoted in Husarik (2012), p. 54.</ref> The resulting movement was a mammoth work, longer than the five other movements of the quartet together.<ref>The fugue is 741 measures long; the total number of measures in the other movements is 643.</ref> The fugue is dedicated to the [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], his student and patron.\n\n[[File:Holz karl.jpg|thumb|Karl Holz, violinist and confidant of Beethoven in his last years. Holz was second violinist in the Schuppanzigh String Quartet, which debuted the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}''. Holz was charged with the task of convincing Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of the quartet, Op. 130.]]\nAt the first performance of the quartet, other movements were received enthusiastically, but the fugue was not a success. Many musicians and critics in Vienna's music periodicals denounced the fugue.<ref>Solomon (2003), p. 35</ref> Composer and violinist [[Louis Spohr]] called the fugue, and the other late quartets, \"an indecipherable, uncorrected horror\".<ref>Service (2008)</ref>\n\nDespite the contemporary criticism, Beethoven himself never doubted the value of the fugue. [[Karl Holz (violinist)|Karl Holz]], Beethoven's confidant and second violinist of the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] that performed the work, brought Beethoven the news that the audience had demanded encores of two middle movements. Beethoven, enraged, was reported to have growled, \"And why didn't they encore the Fugue? That alone should have been repeated! Cattle! Asses!\"<ref>Solomon (1977) p. 447</ref>\n\nHowever, the fugue was so roundly condemned by critics and audience alike that Beethoven's publisher, Matthias [[Artaria]] (1793\u20131835), decided to try to convince Beethoven to publish it separately. Holz was given the task of convincing Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of the quartet, writing:\n\n<blockquote>\nArtaria ... charged me with the terrible and difficult task of convincing Beethoven to compose a new finale, which would be more accessible to the listeners as well as the instrumentalists, to substitute for the fugue which was so difficult to understand. I maintained to Beethoven that this fugue, which departed from the ordinary and surpassed even the last quartets in originality, should be published as a separate work and that it merited a designation as a separate opus. I communicated to him that Artaria was disposed to pay him a supplementary honorarium for the new finale. Beethoven told me he would reflect on it, but already on the next day I received a letter giving his agreement.<ref>Thayer' ''Ludwig van Beethovens Leben''. quoted in Solomon (1977), p. 449</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhy the notoriously stubborn Beethoven apparently agreed so readily to replace the fugue is an enigma in the history of this quintessentially enigmatic piece. Historians have speculated that he probably did it for the money (given that Beethoven was extremely bad at managing his personal finances and was often broke), while others believe it was to satisfy his critics, or simply because Beethoven came to feel the fugue stood best on its own.<ref>For the differing opinions on this, see Solomon (1977), p. 449, Marliave (1928), p. 257, Winter and Martin (1994), p. 239.</ref> The fugue is connected to the other movements of Opus 130 by various hints of motifs, and by a tonal link to the preceding ''Cavatina'' movement (the Cavatina ends on a G, and the fugue begins with the same G<ref>Bitloch (2012)</ref>). The replacement final movement also begins on a G, but is relatively light in character and completely uncontroversial. Beethoven composed this replacement in late 1826, and it was the last complete piece of music he was to write. In May 1827, about two months after Beethoven's death, Artaria published the first edition of Op. 130 with the new finale, and the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' separately as Op. 133, as well as a [[Piano four hands|four-hand piano]] arrangement of the fugue, as Op. 134.<ref>Lockwood (2006), pp. 459\u2013461</ref>\n\n==General analysis==\nDozens of analyses have attempted to delve into the structure of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'', with conflicting results. The work has been described as an expansion of the formal Baroque grand fugue,<ref>Kirkendale (1963)</ref> as a multi-movement work rolled into a single piece,<ref>Rosen (1972), Levy (2008)</ref> and as a symphonic poem in [[sonata form]].<ref>Radcliffe (1978)</ref> Stephen Husarik has suggested that the relationships between the keys of the different sections of the fugue mirror what he describes as the wedge-like structure of the eight-note motif that is the main fugal subject, the \"contour [that] is a driving force behind the Grosse Fuge\".<ref>Husarik (2012)</ref> But Leah Gayle Weinberg writes: \"The Grosse Fuge has been and continues to be a problematic subject of scholarly discussion for many reasons; the most basic is that its very form defies categorization.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Beethoven\u2019s Janus-faced Quartet: Opus 130, the Gro\u03b2e Fuge and the Allegro |last=Weinberg |first=Leah |publisher=Wesleyan University |year=2008 |isbn= |location= |pages=26}}</ref>\n\n===Main motif===\nThe central [[Motif (music)|motif]] of the fugue is an eight-note [[Subject (music)|subject]] that climbs chromatically upward:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge First theme.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 6/8 \\key bes \\major\n        g2. gis f' e gis, a fis' g\n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nA similar motif appears in Act II, measures 44-47, of the \"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\" from [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1774), and also in [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 5|String Quartet in G, Op. 33, No. 5]]. ii, mm. 27-29.<ref>Husarik, p. 255</ref> Another similar subject, with [[Syncopation|syncopated]] or gapped rhythm (called ''[[Unterbrechung]]'' in German), appears in a treatise on counterpoint by [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger]],<ref>Kirkendale, p. 18.</ref> who taught Beethoven composition. [[Joseph Kerman]] suggests that Beethoven modeled the motif after [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] fugue in B minor from ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.<ref>Kerman (2008), p. 167.</ref> Its subject is shown below:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Subject of the Fugue in B minor BWV 869 from the Well-tempered Clavier by Bach.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c' {\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 96\n        \\time 4/4 \\key b \\minor\n        r8 fis( d b) g'( fis) b( ais) \n        e( dis) c'( b) fis( eis) d'( cis!) bis( \n        cis( a fis) gis2\\trill\n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nWhatever the origin of the motif, Beethoven was fascinated by it.

The usual practice in a traditional fugue is to make a simple, unadorned statement of the subject at the outset, but Beethoven from the very beginning presents the subject in a host of variations.\n\n=== Other motifs ===\nIn stark contrast to this simple chromatic motif is the second subject of the fugue, which leaps dramatically in huge intervals \u2013 tenths and twelfths:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge Second theme.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c' {\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #31\n        \\time 4/4 \\key bes \\major\n        \\partial2 r8. d16\\ff f'8[ r16 f]\n        f8[ r16 d,] f'8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 d,] aes''8[ r16 aes]\n        aes8[ r16 g] g8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 d]\n        es8[ r16 es,] es'8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 es,] g'8[ r16 g]\n        g8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 d] d8 \n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nThe third motif is a lilting melody that serves as the theme of the ''andante'' section of the fugue:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge Third theme.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #167\n        \\time 2/4 \\key ges \\major\n        \\bar \"\"\n\n        r8 bes16(_\\markup { \\italic sempre \\dynamic pp } aes) aes( ges des' ces)\n        ces( bes es des) des( ces des bes)\n        des( ces es des) des( ces des bes)\n        bes( aes ges f es des es ces)\n        bes8\n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nA fourth element \u2013 not so much a motif as an effect \u2013 is the [[Trill (music)|trill]].

Beethoven then repeats the subject, but in a completely different rhythm, in [[diminution]] (meaning at double the tempo), twice, climbing up the scale; and then, again silence, and again the subject, this time unadorned, in a dramatic drop to ''pianissimo'' in the key of F major.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Opening 2.ogg|thumb|center|2nd statement of motif]]\n\nThis leads to a statement of the third fugal subject, with the first subject in the bass:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Opening third theme.ogg|thumb|center|3rd motif introduced]]\n\nThus, Beethoven, in this brief introduction, presents not only the material that will make up the entire piece, but also the spirit: violent shifts of mood, melodies disintegrating into chaos, dramatic silences, instability, and struggle.\n\n===First fugue===\nFollowing the overture is a strictly formal [[double fugue]] in the key of B{{music|flat}} major that follows all the rules of a Baroque fugue: an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] and three variations, showcasing different [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] devices. But this is anything but a tame Baroque fugue: it is violent and dissonant, pitting awkward leaps of the second subject in iambic rhythm against the main subject in syncopation, at a constant dynamic that never falls below ''forte''. The resulting angular rhythmic confusion and displaced dissonances last almost five minutes.\n\nFirst, Beethoven restates the main subject, broken up by rests between each note:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Opening First theme again.ogg|thumb|center|Syncopated statement of motif]]\n\nThen begins a double fugue, two subjects, played one against the other. The second subject in the first violin, and the first subject, [[Syncopation|syncopated]], in the viola.

The ''fortissimo'' descends immediately to ''piano'', for a short interlude before the second fugue. This interlude is based on the main subject in diminution, meaning in double time. On top of this, Beethoven adds a lilting, slightly comic melody; analysts who see the fugue as a multi-movement work consider this section the equivalent of a ''[[scherzo]]''.<ref>See Kinderman (1995) or Kirkendale (1963)</ref>\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Interlude.ogg|thumb|center|Interlude before 2nd fugue]]\n\nIn this interlude, Beethoven introduces the use of [[Trill (music)|trill]] (hinted at at the end of the ''Meno mosso'' section). The music grows in intensity and shifts into A{{flat}} major, for a new learned fugue.\n\nIn this fugue, Beethoven puts together three versions of the main subject: (1) the subject in its simple form, but in [[Augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (meaning half the speed); (2) the same subject, abbreviated, in [[Retrograde (music)|retrograde]] (that is, played backwards); and (3) a variation of the first half of the subject in [[diminution]] (that is, double time).

Kerman writes of this fugal section, \"The piece seems to be in danger of cracking under the tension of its own rhythmic fury.\"<ref>Kerman (1979), p. 283</ref>\n\nIn the second episode of this fugue, Beethoven adds in the triplet figure from the first variation of the first fugue:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Second Fuge variation 1.ogg|thumb|center|2nd fugue, 1st variation]]\n\nThe trills become more intense. In the third episode, in the dominant key of E{{flat}} major, Beethoven uses a leaping motif that recalls the second subject of the first fugue:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Second Fuge variation 2.ogg|thumb|center|2nd fugue, 2nd variation]]\n\nThe fourth episode returns to the key of A{{flat}}. The cello plays the main subject in a way that harks back to the ''overtura''. More elements of the first fugue return: the syncopation used for the main subject, the tenth leaps from the second subject, the diminuted main subject in the viola.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Second Fuge variation 3.ogg|thumb|center|2nd fugue, 3rd variation]]\n\n===Thematic convergence and coda===\nThis leads back to a restatement of the ''meno mosso e moderato'' section. This time, though, instead of a silky ''pianissimo'', the [[Fugue|''fugato'']] is played ''forte'', heavily accented (Beethoven writes {{serif|'''''f'''''}} on every sixteenth-note group), march-like. Analysts who see the fugue as a variation of [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] form consider this to be part of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section, though the material does not return in home key. In this section, Beethoven uses another complex contrapuntal device: the second violin plays the theme, the first violin plays the main subject in a high register, and the viola plays the main subject in [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] \u2013 that is, upside down.<ref>Kirkendale, p. 21.</ref>\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge recap 1.ogg\">\n    { \n#(set-global-staff-size 16)\n<< \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #493\n            \\bar \"\"\n            \\tempo \"Meno Mosso e moderato\"\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n                r4 d\\sf\n                es\\sf des'!\\sf\n                c\\f g\\f\n                aes\\f ges'\\f\n                f\\f a,\\f\n                bes\\f aes'!\\f\n                g\\f\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\clef treble \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                bes16( aes c bes) bes( aes bes' aes)\n                aes(\\sf g c bes) bes(\\sf aes g f)\n                f(\\f es aes c,) f(\\f es f des)\n                des(\\f c bes aes) aes(\\f ges f es)\n                es(\\f des c des) ges'(\\f f ges es)\n                es(\\f des c bes aes\\f g! aes f)\n                f(\\f es d! es)\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\clef alto \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                <c es>8\\f r f4\\sf\n                es\\sf g,\\sf\n                aes\\f bes\\f\n                aes\\f c,\\f\n                des\\f c'\\f\n                bes\\f d,!\\f\n                es\\f\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\clef bass \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c {\n                aes8\\f r r4\n                r16 aes aes'' aes aes aes,, aes'' aes\n                aes8 r r4\n                r16 c,,, es' es es c, es' es\n                des,8 r r4\n                r16 des f' f f d, f' f\n                es,8 r\n                }\n         >>\n    >>\n>> }\n</score>\n\nA series of trills leads back to the home key of B{{flat}}, and a restatement of the ''scherzo'' section.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge recap 2.ogg|thumb|center|Recapitulation of ''scherzo'' section]]\n\nThere follows a section that analysts have described as \"uneasy hesitation\"<ref>D'Indy in ''Cobbett'' (1929), p. 104.</ref> or \"puzzling\" and \"diffused\".<ref>Winter and Martin (1994), pp. 243\u20134</ref> Fragments of the various subjects appear and disappear, and the music seems to lose energy. A silence, and then a fragmentary burst of the opening of the first fugue. Another silence. A snippet of the ''meno mosso''. Another silence. (In a way, this is similar to how, in the final movement of the Ninth Symphony, he briefly quotes the first, second, and third movements in turn.) And then a ''fortissimo'' restatement of the very opening of the piece, leading to the coda.<ref>Most analysts consider this unison the beginning of the coda, though Beethoven himself, in the autograph copy, writes \"Coda\" at bar 493 (key change to B{{flat}}).</ref>\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge recap 3.ogg|thumb|center|Fragments of preceding sections, before the coda]]\n\nFrom here the music moves forward, at first haltingly, but then with more and more energy, to the final passage, where the first subject is played in triplets below the soaring violin line playing a variant of the second subject.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge recap 4.ogg|thumb|center|Finale]]\n\n==Understanding the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}''==\nAnalyses of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' help to understand the structure and contrapuntal devices of this mammoth piece. But, writes musicologist [[David Benjamin Levy|David B. Levy]], \"Regardless of how one hears the piece structurally, the composition remains filled with paradoxes that leave the listener ultimately dissatisfied with an exegesis derived solely from a structural perspective.\"<ref>Levy (2007)</ref> Since its composition, musicians, critics and listeners have tried to explain the tremendous impact this piece has.<ref>For a summary of attempts at understanding the fugue, see Kirkendale, pp 14 \u2013 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Beethoven am Totenbett Litho.JPG|thumb|upright|Lithograph of Beethoven on his deathbed, by [[Josef Danhauser]]]] It \"is one of the great artistic testaments to the human capacity for meaning in the face of the threat of chaos. Abiding faith in the relevance of visionary struggle in our lives powerfully informs the structure and character of the music\", writes Mark Steinberg, violinist of the [[Brentano String Quartet]]. \"More than anything else in music ... it justifies the ways of God to men\", writes musicologist [[Leonard Ratner]].<ref>Ratner (1995). Ratner attributes this quote to J. W. N. Sullivan's book ''Beethoven: His Spiritual Development'' (1927); however, the quote (a paraphrase from John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'') does not appear in Sullivan.</ref>\n\nBut beyond a recognition of the hugeness and almost mystical impact of the music, critics fail to agree on its character.<ref>For a review of the divergent opinions on the fugue, see also Kirkendale, pp 14\u201318.</ref> Robert S. Kahn says \"it presents a titanic struggle overcome.\"<ref>Kahn (2010)</ref> Daniel Chua, on the contrary, writes, \"The work speaks of failure, the very opposite of the triumphant synthesis associated with Beethovenian recapitulations.\"<ref>Chua (1995), p. 240</ref>{{fcn|date=September 2018}} Stephen Husarik, in his essay \"Musical direction and the wedge in Beethoven's high comedy, Grosse Fuge op. 133\", contends that in the fugue, Beethoven is actually writing a parody of Baroque formalism. \"The B{{flat}} Fuga of op.133 stumbles forward in what is probably the most relentless and humorous assertion of modal rhythms since 12th century Notre Dame organum.\"<ref>Husarik (2012), p. 58</ref> Kahn disagrees: \"... the comparison to comic music is surprising. There is nothing comic about the Grosse Fuge ....\"<ref>Kahn (2010)</ref>\n\nIn many discussions of the piece, the issue of struggle is central. Sara Bitloch, violinist of the Elias String Quartet, says this sense of struggle informs her group's interpretation of the fugue. \"Every part has to feel like it's a huge struggle&nbsp;... You need to finish the Grosse Fuge absolutely exhausted.\"<ref>Bitloch (2012)</ref> She calls the piece \"apocalyptic\". [[Arnold Steinhardt]] of the [[Guarneri String Quartet]] calls it \"Armageddon ... the chaos out of which life itself evolved\".<ref>Steinhardt, in Miller (2006), p. 40</ref>\n\nOne way to express the impact of the fugue is through poetry. In her poem \"Little Fugue\", [[Sylvia Plath]] associates the fugue with death, in a melange of hazy associations with the yew tree (a symbol of death in Celtic Britain), the Holocaust, and the death of her own father:<ref>[[Sylvia Plath]], ''Collected Poems'' (1981) Turtleback Books</ref>\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nHe could hear Beethoven:\nBlack yew, white cloud,\nThe horrific complications.\nFinger-traps\u2014a tumult of keys.\n\nEmpty and silly as plates,\nSo the blind smile.\nI envy big noises,\nThe yew hedge of the Grosse Fuge.\nDeafness is something else.\nSuch a dark funnel, my father!\nI see your voice\nBlack and leafy, as in my childhood.</poem>\n|author=Sylvia Plath, from the poem \"Little Fugue\" (1965)\n}}\n\nThe poet [[Mark Doty]] wrote of his feelings on listening to the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'':<ref>Mark Doty, \"Grosse Fuge\" in ''Atlantis'' (1995) Harper Perennial, {{ISBN|0-06-095106-0}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nWhat does it mean, chaos\ngathered into a sudden bronze sweetness,\nan October flourish, and then that moment\ndenied, turned acid, disassembling,\nquestioned, rephrased?</poem>\n|author=Mark Doty, from the poem \"Grosse Fuge\" (1995)\n}}\n\n==Reception and musical influence==\n{{Listen|type=music\n | filename     = Lener String Quartet \u201cGrosse Fuge\u201d (Beethoven) all.ogg\n | title        = 1919 recording\n | description  = First published recording, performed by the [[L\u00e9ner Quartet]].

Hardly birthmarked by its age, the Great Fugue is, in rhythm alone, more subtle than any music of my own century ... I love it beyond everything.\" Pianist [[Glenn Gould]] said, \"For me, the 'Grosse Fuge' is not only the greatest work Beethoven ever wrote but just about the most astonishing piece in musical literature.\"<ref>Page, p. 459</ref>\n\nSome analysts and musicians see the fugue as a first assault on the [[diatonic]] tonal system that prevailed in Classical music. Robert Kahn sees the main subject of the fugue as a precursor of the [[tone row]],<ref>Kahn (2010), p. 155</ref> the basis of the [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone system]] developed by [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. \"Your cradle was Beethoven's Grosse Fuge,\" artist [[Oskar Kokoschka]] wrote to Schoenberg in a letter.{{sfn|Brand|Hailey|1997|p=3}} Composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] quotes the subject in his third string quartet (1983). There have also been numerous orchestral arrangements of the fugue, including by conductor [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] and [[Felix Weingartner]].\n\n==Performance challenges==\nPerformers approaching the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}'' face a host of technical and musical challenges. Among the technical difficulties of the piece are difficult passagework, complex [[Cross-beat|cross-rhythms]] that require exact synchronization, and problems of intonation, where the harmonies pass from dissonance to resolution.<ref>For a description of some of the technical difficulties of the piece, see ''[https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/444529 Rehearsal Notes]'' at IMSLP, or {{harvnb|Blum|1987|pp=71, 73}}.</ref>\n\nOnce mastering the technical difficulties, there are many interpretive issues to resolve.<ref>For a discussion of some of the musical issues posed by the fugue, see {{harvnb|Blum|1987|pp=22, 59, 70, 71, 73, 158, 159, 164-165, 172, and 222}}.</ref> The first of these is: in what context to play the fugue? As the finale of Opus 130, as it was originally written, or as a separate piece?<ref>For further discussion of this see Solomon (1978) p. 448, {{harvnb|Blum|1987|p=159}}, Griffiths (1983), p. 106.</ref> Playing the fugue as the final movement of Opus 130, rather than the light, Haydnesque replacement movement, completely changes the character of the quartet, analysts Robert Winter and Robert Martin note.<ref>Winter and Martin (1994), p. 238. The word \"Haydnesque\" is theirs.</ref> Played with the new finale, the preceding movement, the \"Cavatina\", a heartfelt and intense aria, is the emotional center of the piece. Played with the fugue as the finale, the Cavatina is a prelude to the massive and compelling fugue. On the other hand, the fugue stands alone well. \"Current taste is decisively in favor of the fugal finale,\" conclude Winter and Martin.<ref>Winter and Martin (1994), p. 238.</ref> A number of quartets have recorded Opus 130 with the fugue and the replacement finale on separate disks<!--, so that listeners can hear the work either way and make up their own minds-->.\n\nA second issue facing performers is whether to choose a \"learned\" interpretation \u2013 one that clarifies the complex contrapuntal structure of the piece \u2013 or one that focuses primarily on the dramatic impulses of the music.<ref>Bitloch. Also see Arnold Steinhardt in Miller (2006), p. 40, {{harvnb|Blum|1987|p=164}}.</ref> \"Beethoven had taken a form that is basically an intellectual form, where the emotions take second place, compared to the structure, and he has completely turned that around, writing one of the most emotionally charged pieces ever,\" says Sara Bitloch of the Elias Quartet.<ref>Bitloch</ref> \"As a performer that's a particularly difficult balance to find ... Our first approach was to find a kind of hierarchy in the themes ... but we found that when we do that we're really missing the point of the piece.\"\n\n=== Tied eighth notes ===\nAfter deciding on the overall approach to the music, there are numerous local decisions to be made about how to play particular passages.<ref>For discussion of specific interpretive issues in the fugue, see also {{harvnb|Blum|1987|pp=59, 70, 71, 73, 164-165}}, ''Rehearsal Notes'' (IMSLP), Winter and Martin (1994), pp. 239-244.</ref> Perhaps the most notable of these issues concerns the peculiar notation that Beethoven uses in the syncopated presentation of the main subject \u2013 first in the ''overtura'', but later throughout the piece. Rather than writing this as a series of quarter notes, he writes two tied eighth notes.<ref>''Grosse Fuge'', International edition, measures 26\u201330.</ref>\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n    \\relative c' { \\time 4/4 \\key bes \\major \\tempo Allegro \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #26\n        \\bar \"\"\n        r4 bes8(\\pp bes) r4 bes8( bes) \n        r4 b8(_\\markup { \\italic sempre \\dynamic pp } b) r4 aes'8( aes) \n        r4 g8( g) r4 b,8( b) \n        r4 c8( c) a'[( bes]) bes[( bes]) \n        a( a) r4\\fermata\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n | header       = '''Recordings of tied eighth notes'''\n | filename     = Interpretation of eighth note subject of Grosse Fuge by Alban Berg quartet.ogg\n | title        = Alban Berg Quartett\n | description  = Emphasis on the first eighth note.<ref>[[Alban Berg Quartett]] (Gunter Pichler, violin, [[Gerhard Schulz (musician)|Gerhard Schulz]], violin, Thomas Kakuska, viola, Valentin Erben, cello), Recorded live at the Mozart-Saal, [[Konzerthaus, Vienna|Konzerthaus, Wien]], June 11, 1989</ref>\n | filename2     = Emerson_Quartet_playing_eighth_note_passage_of_Grosse_Fuge.ogg\n | title2        = Emerson String Quartet\n | description2  = Eighth notes are played as distinctly separate.<ref>Emerson Quartet (Eugene Drucker, violin, Philip Setzer, violin, Lawrence Dutton, viola, Paul Watkins, cello), from their album ''Ludwig van Beethoven: The Late String Quartets'' (Deutche Gramaphon, 2 May 2003)</ref>\n | filename3     = Brentano_quartet_interpretation_of_eighth_note_passage_in_Grosse_Fuge.ogg\n | title3        = Brentano String Quartet\n | description3  = Some of the eighth notes are separated, some joined.<ref>Brentano Quartet (Mark Steinberg, violin, Serena Canin, violin, Misha Amory, viola, Nina Lee, cello), recorded live in concert, Princeton University, April 2012</ref>\n}}\n\nWhat did Beethoven mean by this? Many musicologists have tried to explain: [[David Benjamin Levy|David Levy]] has written an entire article on the notation,<ref>Levy (2007)</ref> and Stephen Husarik looked to the history of Baroque [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] for an explanation.<ref>Husarik, Speck. p. 261. Husarik contends that the slur suggests a dissonant Baroque vocal figure known as \"trilletto\" which is removed and redistributed to another voice part at the end of Grosse Fuge in order to resolve long term dissonance.</ref> Performers have interpreted it in various ways. The [[Alban Berg Quartett]] plays the notes almost as a single note, but with an emphasis on the first eighth note to create a subtle differentiation. Eugene Drucker of the [[Emerson String Quartet]] plays this as two distinct eighth notes. Mark Steinberg of the [[Brentano String Quartet]] sometimes joins the eighth notes, and sometimes separates them, marking the difference by playing the first eighth without vibrato, then adding vibrato for the second. {{Clear}}\n\n==Arrangement for piano four hands==\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|Manuscript of the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}'' arranged by Beethoven for piano four hands]]\nIn early 1826, the publisher of the Op. 130 String Quartet, Mathias Artaria, told Beethoven there were \"many requests\" for a [[Duet (music)|piano four-hand]] arrangement of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge''.<ref>Solomon (1977), p. 449. Considering the unpopularity of the piece, Solomon speculates that this was a ploy to convince Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of op. 130.</ref> Strangely, this was well before any known discussion of publishing the fugue independently of the quartet. Artaria asked Beethoven to prepare the piano arrangement, but Beethoven was not interested, so Artaria instead asked Anton Halm to prepare it. Beethoven was not satisfied with Halm's work and subsequently made his own note-for-note arrangement of the fugue. Beethoven's arrangement was completed subsequent to the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|C{{sharp}} minor String Quartet, Op. 131]], and was published by Artaria as Op. 134.<ref>Cooper (2008), p. 364</ref>\n\n===Rediscovery of manuscript===\nIn July 2005, an authentic 1826 Beethoven manuscript titled \"Grande Tugue [sic] \u00e0 quatre mains\" was found<ref>Wakin (2005)</ref><ref>CBC article (2005)</ref> by a librarian at the [[Palmer Theological Seminary]] in [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]]. The manuscript was authenticated by Dr. Jeffrey Kallberg at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and Dr. Stephen Roe, head of [[Sotheby's]] Manuscript Department. This was the four-hand piano arrangement of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'', Op. 134. The manuscript had been missing for 115 years. It was auctioned by Sotheby's on 1 December 2005, and bought for [[ISO 4217|GBP]] 1.12&nbsp;million (USD 1.95&nbsp;million) by a then-unknown purchaser, who has since revealed himself to be [[Bruce Kovner]], a publicity-shy multi-billionaire who donated the manuscript \u2013 along with 139 other original and rare pieces of music  \u2013 to the [[Juilliard School of Music]] in February 2006. It has since become available in Juilliard's online manuscript collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juilliardmanuscriptcollection.org/|title=The Juilliard Manuscript Collection}}</ref> The manuscript's known provenance is that it was listed in an 1890 catalogue and sold at an auction in Berlin to a [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, industrialist, whose daughter gave it and other manuscripts including a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] ''Fantasia'' to a church in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in 1952.

An immense [[Fugue#Double (triple, quadruple) fugue|double fugue]], it was universally condemned by contemporary music critics.

[[Igor Stravinsky]] described it as \"an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary forever.\"<ref>Stravinsky and Craft (1963), p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' originally served as the final movement of his [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Quartet No. 13 in B{{music|flat}} major]] (Op. 130), written in 1825. But Beethoven's publisher, who was concerned about the dismal commercial prospects of the piece, urged Beethoven to replace the fugue with a new finale. Beethoven complied, and the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' was published separately in 1827 as Op. 133. It was composed when Beethoven was almost completely deaf, and is considered to be part of his set of [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late quartets]]. It was first performed in 1826, as the finale of the B{{music|flat}} quartet, by the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]].\n\nMusic analysts and critics have described the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' as \"inaccessible\",<ref>B.H.

His choice of a fugal form for the last movement was well grounded in tradition: [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and Beethoven himself had previously used fugues as final movements of quartets. But in recent years, Beethoven had become increasingly concerned with the challenge of integrating this Baroque form into the Classical structure. \"In my student days I wrote dozens of [fugues] ... but [imagination] also wishes to exert its privileges ... and a new and really poetic element must be introduced into the traditional form,\" Beethoven wrote.<ref>[[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]]: ''Ludwig van Beethovens Leben''. quoted in Husarik (2012), p. 54.</ref> The resulting movement was a mammoth work, longer than the five other movements of the quartet together.<ref>The fugue is 741 measures long; the total number of measures in the other movements is 643.</ref> The fugue is dedicated to the [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], his student and patron.\n\n[[File:Holz karl.jpg|thumb|Karl Holz, violinist and confidant of Beethoven in his last years. Holz was second violinist in the Schuppanzigh String Quartet, which debuted the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}''. Holz was charged with the task of convincing Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of the quartet, Op. 130.]]\nAt the first performance of the quartet, other movements were received enthusiastically, but the fugue was not a success. Many musicians and critics in Vienna's music periodicals denounced the fugue.<ref>Solomon (2003), p. 35</ref> Composer and violinist [[Louis Spohr]] called the fugue, and the other late quartets, \"an indecipherable, uncorrected horror\".<ref>Service (2008)</ref>\n\nDespite the contemporary criticism, Beethoven himself never doubted the value of the fugue. [[Karl Holz (violinist)|Karl Holz]], Beethoven's confidant and second violinist of the [[Schuppanzigh Quartet]] that performed the work, brought Beethoven the news that the audience had demanded encores of two middle movements. Beethoven, enraged, was reported to have growled, \"And why didn't they encore the Fugue? That alone should have been repeated! Cattle! Asses!\"<ref>Solomon (1977) p. 447</ref>\n\nHowever, the fugue was so roundly condemned by critics and audience alike that Beethoven's publisher, Matthias [[Artaria]] (1793\u20131835), decided to try to convince Beethoven to publish it separately. Holz was given the task of convincing Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of the quartet, writing:\n\n<blockquote>\nArtaria ... charged me with the terrible and difficult task of convincing Beethoven to compose a new finale, which would be more accessible to the listeners as well as the instrumentalists, to substitute for the fugue which was so difficult to understand. I maintained to Beethoven that this fugue, which departed from the ordinary and surpassed even the last quartets in originality, should be published as a separate work and that it merited a designation as a separate opus. I communicated to him that Artaria was disposed to pay him a supplementary honorarium for the new finale. Beethoven told me he would reflect on it, but already on the next day I received a letter giving his agreement.<ref>Thayer' ''Ludwig van Beethovens Leben''. quoted in Solomon (1977), p. 449</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhy the notoriously stubborn Beethoven apparently agreed so readily to replace the fugue is an enigma in the history of this quintessentially enigmatic piece. Historians have speculated that he probably did it for the money (given that Beethoven was extremely bad at managing his personal finances and was often broke), while others believe it was to satisfy his critics, or simply because Beethoven came to feel the fugue stood best on its own.<ref>For the differing opinions on this, see Solomon (1977), p. 449, Marliave (1928), p. 257, Winter and Martin (1994), p. 239.</ref> The fugue is connected to the other movements of Opus 130 by various hints of motifs, and by a tonal link to the preceding ''Cavatina'' movement (the Cavatina ends on a G, and the fugue begins with the same G<ref>Bitloch (2012)</ref>). The replacement final movement also begins on a G, but is relatively light in character and completely uncontroversial. Beethoven composed this replacement in late 1826, and it was the last complete piece of music he was to write. In May 1827, about two months after Beethoven's death, Artaria published the first edition of Op. 130 with the new finale, and the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' separately as Op. 133, as well as a [[Piano four hands|four-hand piano]] arrangement of the fugue, as Op. 134.<ref>Lockwood (2006), pp. 459\u2013461</ref>\n\n==General analysis==\nDozens of analyses have attempted to delve into the structure of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'', with conflicting results. The work has been described as an expansion of the formal Baroque grand fugue,<ref>Kirkendale (1963)</ref> as a multi-movement work rolled into a single piece,<ref>Rosen (1972), Levy (2008)</ref> and as a symphonic poem in [[sonata form]].<ref>Radcliffe (1978)</ref> Stephen Husarik has suggested that the relationships between the keys of the different sections of the fugue mirror what he describes as the wedge-like structure of the eight-note motif that is the main fugal subject, the \"contour [that] is a driving force behind the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}''\".<ref>Husarik (2012)</ref> But Leah Gayle Weinberg writes: \"The Gro\u00dfe Fuge has been and continues to be a problematic subject of scholarly discussion for many reasons; the most basic is that its very form defies categorization.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Beethoven\u2019s Janus-faced Quartet: Opus 130, the Gro\u03b2e Fuge and the Allegro |last=Weinberg |first=Leah |publisher=Wesleyan University |year=2008 |isbn= |location= |pages=26}}</ref>\n\n===Main motif===\nThe central [[Motif (music)|motif]] of the fugue is an eight-note [[Subject (music)|subject]] that climbs chromatically upward:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge First theme.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\time 6/8 \\key bes \\major\n        g2. gis f' e gis, a fis' g\n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nA similar motif appears in Act II, measures 44-47, of the \"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\" from [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] opera ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1774), and also in [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 5|String Quartet in G, Op. 33, No. 5]]. ii, mm. 27-29.<ref>Husarik, p. 255</ref> Another similar subject, with [[Syncopation|syncopated]] or gapped rhythm (called ''[[Unterbrechung]]'' in German), appears in a treatise on counterpoint by [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger]],<ref>Kirkendale, p. 18.</ref> who taught Beethoven composition. [[Joseph Kerman]] suggests that Beethoven modeled the motif after [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach's]] fugue in B minor from ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.<ref>Kerman (2008), p. 167.</ref> Its subject is shown below:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Subject of the Fugue in B minor BWV 869 from the Well-tempered Clavier by Bach.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c' {\n        \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 96\n        \\time 4/4 \\key b \\minor\n        r8 fis( d b) g'( fis) b( ais) \n        e( dis) c'( b) fis( eis) d'( cis!) bis( \n        cis( a fis) gis2\\trill\n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nWhatever the origin of the motif, Beethoven was fascinated by it.

The usual practice in a traditional fugue is to make a simple, unadorned statement of the subject at the outset, but Beethoven from the very beginning presents the subject in a host of variations.\n\n=== Other motifs ===\nIn stark contrast to this simple chromatic motif is the second subject of the fugue, which leaps dramatically in huge intervals \u2013 tenths and twelfths:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge Second theme.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c' {\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #31\n        \\time 4/4 \\key bes \\major\n        \\partial2 r8. d16\\ff f'8[ r16 f]\n        f8[ r16 d,] f'8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 d,] aes''8[ r16 aes]\n        aes8[ r16 g] g8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 d]\n        es8[ r16 es,] es'8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 es,] g'8[ r16 g]\n        g8[ r16 f] f8[ r16 es] es8[ r16 d] d8 \n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nThe third motif is a lilting melody that serves as the theme of the ''andante'' section of the fugue:\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge Third theme.ogg\"> {\n    \\relative c'' {\n        \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #167\n        \\time 2/4 \\key ges \\major\n        \\bar \"\"\n\n        r8 bes16(_\\markup { \\italic sempre \\dynamic pp } aes) aes( ges des' ces)\n        ces( bes es des) des( ces des bes)\n        des( ces es des) des( ces des bes)\n        bes( aes ges f es des es ces)\n        bes8\n    }\n\n}\n</score>\n\nA fourth element \u2013 not so much a motif as an effect \u2013 is the [[Trill (music)|trill]].

But this is anything but a tame Baroque fugue: it is violent and dissonant, pitting awkward leaps of the second subject in iambic rhythm against the main subject in syncopation, at a constant dynamic that never falls below ''forte''. The resulting angular rhythmic confusion and displaced dissonances last almost five minutes.\n\nFirst, Beethoven restates the main subject, broken up by rests between each note:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Opening First theme again.ogg|thumb|center|Syncopated statement of motif]]\n\nThen begins a double fugue, two subjects, played one against the other.

The ''fortissimo'' descends immediately to ''piano'', for a short interlude before the second fugue. This interlude is based on the main subject in diminution, meaning in double time. On top of this, Beethoven adds a lilting, slightly comic melody; analysts who see the fugue as a multi-movement work consider this section the equivalent of a ''[[scherzo]]''.<ref>See Kinderman (1995) or Kirkendale (1963)</ref>\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Interlude.ogg|thumb|center|Interlude before 2nd fugue]]\n\nIn this interlude, Beethoven introduces the use of [[Trill (music)|trill]] (hinted at at the end of the ''Meno mosso'' section). The music grows in intensity and shifts into A{{flat}} major, for a new learned fugue.\n\nIn this fugue, Beethoven puts together three versions of the main subject: (1) the subject in its simple form, but in [[Augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (meaning half the speed); (2) the same subject, abbreviated, in [[Retrograde (music)|retrograde]] (that is, played backwards); and (3) a variation of the first half of the subject in [[diminution]] (that is, double time).

Kerman writes of this fugal section, \"The piece seems to be in danger of cracking under the tension of its own rhythmic fury.\"<ref>Kerman (1979), p. 283</ref>\n\nIn the second episode of this fugue, Beethoven adds in the triplet figure from the first variation of the first fugue:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Second Fuge variation 1.ogg|thumb|center|2nd fugue, 1st variation]]\n\nThe trills become more intense. In the third episode, in the dominant key of E{{flat}} major, Beethoven uses a leaping motif that recalls the second subject of the first fugue:\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Second Fuge variation 2.ogg|thumb|center|2nd fugue, 2nd variation]]\n\nThe fourth episode returns to the key of A{{flat}}. The cello plays the main subject in a way that harks back to the ''overtura''. More elements of the first fugue return: the syncopation used for the main subject, the tenth leaps from the second subject, the diminuted main subject in the viola.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Second Fuge variation 3.ogg|thumb|center|2nd fugue, 3rd variation]]\n\n===Thematic convergence and coda===\nThis leads back to a restatement of the ''meno mosso e moderato'' section. This time, though, instead of a silky ''pianissimo'', the [[Fugue|''fugato'']] is played ''forte'', heavily accented (Beethoven writes {{serif|'''''f'''''}} on every sixteenth-note group), march-like. Analysts who see the fugue as a variation of [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] form consider this to be part of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section, though the material does not return in home key. In this section, Beethoven uses another complex contrapuntal device: the second violin plays the theme, the first violin plays the main subject in a high register, and the viola plays the main subject in [[Melodic inversion|inversion]] \u2013 that is, upside down.<ref>Kirkendale, p. 21.</ref>\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\" override_ogg=\"Grosse Fuge recap 1.ogg\">\n    { \n#(set-global-staff-size 16)\n<< \\new StaffGroup <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #493\n            \\bar \"\"\n            \\tempo \"Meno Mosso e moderato\"\n            \\relative c'' {\n                \\clef treble \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n                r4 d\\sf\n                es\\sf des'!\\sf\n                c\\f g\\f\n                aes\\f ges'\\f\n                f\\f a,\\f\n                bes\\f aes'!\\f\n                g\\f\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\clef treble \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                bes16( aes c bes) bes( aes bes' aes)\n                aes(\\sf g c bes) bes(\\sf aes g f)\n                f(\\f es aes c,) f(\\f es f des)\n                des(\\f c bes aes) aes(\\f ges f es)\n                es(\\f des c des) ges'(\\f f ges es)\n                es(\\f des c bes aes\\f g! aes f)\n                f(\\f es d! es)\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\clef alto \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                <c es>8\\f r f4\\sf\n                es\\sf g,\\sf\n                aes\\f bes\\f\n                aes\\f c,\\f\n                des\\f c'\\f\n                bes\\f d,!\\f\n                es\\f\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\clef bass \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n            \\new Voice \\relative c {\n                aes8\\f r r4\n                r16 aes aes'' aes aes aes,, aes'' aes\n                aes8 r r4\n                r16 c,,, es' es es c, es' es\n                des,8 r r4\n                r16 des f' f f d, f' f\n                es,8 r\n                }\n         >>\n    >>\n>> }\n</score>\n\nA series of trills leads back to the home key of B{{flat}}, and a restatement of the ''scherzo'' section.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge recap 2.ogg|thumb|center|Recapitulation of ''scherzo'' section]]\n\nThere follows a section that analysts have described as \"uneasy hesitation\"<ref>D'Indy in ''Cobbett'' (1929), p. 104.</ref> or \"puzzling\" and \"diffused\".<ref>Winter and Martin (1994), pp. 243\u20134</ref> Fragments of the various subjects appear and disappear, and the music seems to lose energy. A silence, and then a fragmentary burst of the opening of the first fugue. Another silence. A snippet of the ''meno mosso''. Another silence. (In a way, this is similar to how, in the final movement of the Ninth Symphony, he briefly quotes the first, second, and third movements in turn.) And then a ''fortissimo'' restatement of the very opening of the piece, leading to the coda.<ref>Most analysts consider this unison the beginning of the coda, though Beethoven himself, in the autograph copy, writes \"Coda\" at bar 493 (key change to B{{flat}}).</ref>\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge recap 3.ogg|thumb|center|Fragments of preceding sections, before the coda]]\n\nFrom here the music moves forward, at first haltingly, but then with more and more energy, to the final passage, where the first subject is played in triplets below the soaring violin line playing a variant of the second subject.\n\n[[File:Grosse Fuge recap 4.ogg|thumb|center|Finale]]\n\n==Understanding the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}''==\nAnalyses of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'' help to understand the structure and contrapuntal devices of this mammoth piece. But, writes musicologist [[David Benjamin Levy|David B. Levy]], \"Regardless of how one hears the piece structurally, the composition remains filled with paradoxes that leave the listener ultimately dissatisfied with an exegesis derived solely from a structural perspective.\"<ref>Levy (2007)</ref> Since its composition, musicians, critics and listeners have tried to explain the tremendous impact this piece has.<ref>For a summary of attempts at understanding the fugue, see Kirkendale, pp 14 \u2013 18.</ref>\n\n[[File:Beethoven am Totenbett Litho.JPG|thumb|upright|Lithograph of Beethoven on his deathbed, by [[Josef Danhauser]]]] It \"is one of the great artistic testaments to the human capacity for meaning in the face of the threat of chaos. Abiding faith in the relevance of visionary struggle in our lives powerfully informs the structure and character of the music\", writes Mark Steinberg, violinist of the [[Brentano String Quartet]]. \"More than anything else in music ... it justifies the ways of God to men\", writes musicologist [[Leonard Ratner]].<ref>Ratner (1995). Ratner attributes this quote to J. W. N. Sullivan's book ''Beethoven: His Spiritual Development'' (1927); however, the quote (a paraphrase from John Milton's ''Paradise Lost'') does not appear in Sullivan.</ref>\n\nBut beyond a recognition of the hugeness and almost mystical impact of the music, critics fail to agree on its character.<ref>For a review of the divergent opinions on the fugue, see also Kirkendale, pp 14\u201318.</ref> Robert S. Kahn says \"it presents a titanic struggle overcome.\"<ref>Kahn (2010)</ref> Daniel Chua, on the contrary, writes, \"The work speaks of failure, the very opposite of the triumphant synthesis associated with Beethovenian recapitulations.\"<ref>Chua (1995), p. 240</ref>{{fcn|date=September 2018}} Stephen Husarik, in his essay \"Musical direction and the wedge in Beethoven's high comedy, Grosse Fuge op. 133\", contends that in the fugue, Beethoven is actually writing a parody of Baroque formalism. \"The B{{flat}} Fuga of op.133 stumbles forward in what is probably the most relentless and humorous assertion of modal rhythms since 12th century Notre Dame organum.\"<ref>Husarik (2012), p. 58</ref> Kahn disagrees: \"... the comparison to comic music is surprising. There is nothing comic about the Grosse Fuge ....\"<ref>Kahn (2010)</ref>\n\nIn many discussions of the piece, the issue of struggle is central. Sara Bitloch, violinist of the Elias String Quartet, says this sense of struggle informs her group's interpretation of the fugue. \"Every part has to feel like it's a huge struggle&nbsp;... You need to finish the Grosse Fuge absolutely exhausted.\"<ref>Bitloch (2012)</ref> She calls the piece \"apocalyptic\". [[Arnold Steinhardt]] of the [[Guarneri String Quartet]] calls it \"Armageddon ... the chaos out of which life itself evolved\".<ref>Steinhardt, in Miller (2006), p. 40</ref>\n\nOne way to express the impact of the fugue is through poetry. In her poem \"Little Fugue\", [[Sylvia Plath]] associates the fugue with death, in a melange of hazy associations with the yew tree (a symbol of death in Celtic Britain), the Holocaust, and the death of her own father:<ref>[[Sylvia Plath]], ''Collected Poems'' (1981) Turtleback Books</ref>\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nHe could hear Beethoven:\nBlack yew, white cloud,\nThe horrific complications.\nFinger-traps\u2014a tumult of keys.\n\nEmpty and silly as plates,\nSo the blind smile.\nI envy big noises,\nThe yew hedge of the Grosse Fuge.\nDeafness is something else.\nSuch a dark funnel, my father!\nI see your voice\nBlack and leafy, as in my childhood.</poem>\n|author=Sylvia Plath, from the poem \"Little Fugue\" (1965)\n}}\n\nThe poet [[Mark Doty]] wrote of his feelings on listening to the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'':<ref>Mark Doty, \"Grosse Fuge\" in ''Atlantis'' (1995) Harper Perennial, {{ISBN|0-06-095106-0}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nWhat does it mean, chaos\ngathered into a sudden bronze sweetness,\nan October flourish, and then that moment\ndenied, turned acid, disassembling,\nquestioned, rephrased?</poem>\n|author=Mark Doty, from the poem \"Grosse Fuge\" (1995)\n}}\n\n==Reception and musical influence==\n{{Listen|type=music\n | filename     = Lener String Quartet \u201cGrosse Fuge\u201d (Beethoven) all.ogg\n | title        = 1919 recording\n | description  = First published recording, performed by the [[L\u00e9ner Quartet]].

Hardly birthmarked by its age, the Great Fugue is, in rhythm alone, more subtle than any music of my own century ... I love it beyond everything.\" Pianist [[Glenn Gould]] said, \"For me, the 'Grosse Fuge' is not only the greatest work Beethoven ever wrote but just about the most astonishing piece in musical literature.\"<ref>Page, p. 459</ref>\n\nSome analysts and musicians see the fugue as a first assault on the [[diatonic]] tonal system that prevailed in Classical music. Robert Kahn sees the main subject of the fugue as a precursor of the [[tone row]],<ref>Kahn (2010), p. 155</ref> the basis of the [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone system]] developed by [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. \"Your cradle was Beethoven's Grosse Fuge,\" artist [[Oskar Kokoschka]] wrote to Schoenberg in a letter.{{sfn|Brand|Hailey|1997|p=3}} Composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] quotes the subject in his third string quartet (1983). There have also been numerous orchestral arrangements of the fugue, including by conductor [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] and [[Felix Weingartner]].\n\n==Performance challenges==\nPerformers approaching the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}'' face a host of technical and musical challenges. Among the technical difficulties of the piece are difficult passagework, complex [[Cross-beat|cross-rhythms]] that require exact synchronization, and problems of intonation, where the harmonies pass from dissonance to resolution.<ref>For a description of some of the technical difficulties of the piece, see ''[https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ImagefromIndex/444529 Rehearsal Notes]'' at IMSLP, or {{harvnb|Blum|1987|pp=71, 73}}.</ref>\n\nOnce mastering the technical difficulties, there are many interpretive issues to resolve.<ref>For a discussion of some of the musical issues posed by the fugue, see {{harvnb|Blum|1987|pp=22, 59, 70, 71, 73, 158, 159, 164-165, 172, and 222}}.</ref> The first of these is: in what context to play the fugue? As the finale of Opus 130, as it was originally written, or as a separate piece?<ref>For further discussion of this see Solomon (1978) p. 448, {{harvnb|Blum|1987|p=159}}, Griffiths (1983), p. 106.</ref> Playing the fugue as the final movement of Opus 130, rather than the light, Haydnesque replacement movement, completely changes the character of the quartet, analysts Robert Winter and Robert Martin note.<ref>Winter and Martin (1994), p. 238. The word \"Haydnesque\" is theirs.</ref> Played with the new finale, the preceding movement, the \"Cavatina\", a heartfelt and intense aria, is the emotional center of the piece. Played with the fugue as the finale, the Cavatina is a prelude to the massive and compelling fugue. On the other hand, the fugue stands alone well. \"Current taste is decisively in favor of the fugal finale,\" conclude Winter and Martin.<ref>Winter and Martin (1994), p. 238.</ref> A number of quartets have recorded Opus 130 with the fugue and the replacement finale on separate disks<!--, so that listeners can hear the work either way and make up their own minds-->.\n\nA second issue facing performers is whether to choose a \"learned\" interpretation \u2013 one that clarifies the complex contrapuntal structure of the piece \u2013 or one that focuses primarily on the dramatic impulses of the music.<ref>Bitloch. Also see Arnold Steinhardt in Miller (2006), p. 40, {{harvnb|Blum|1987|p=164}}.</ref> \"Beethoven had taken a form that is basically an intellectual form, where the emotions take second place, compared to the structure, and he has completely turned that around, writing one of the most emotionally charged pieces ever,\" says Sara Bitloch of the Elias Quartet.<ref>Bitloch</ref> \"As a performer that's a particularly difficult balance to find ... Our first approach was to find a kind of hierarchy in the themes ... but we found that when we do that we're really missing the point of the piece.\"\n\n=== Tied eighth notes ===\nAfter deciding on the overall approach to the music, there are numerous local decisions to be made about how to play particular passages.<ref>For discussion of specific interpretive issues in the fugue, see also {{harvnb|Blum|1987|pp=59, 70, 71, 73, 164-165}}, ''Rehearsal Notes'' (IMSLP), Winter and Martin (1994), pp. 239-244.</ref> Perhaps the most notable of these issues concerns the peculiar notation that Beethoven uses in the syncopated presentation of the main subject \u2013 first in the ''overtura'', but later throughout the piece. Rather than writing this as a series of quarter notes, he writes two tied eighth notes.<ref>''Grosse Fuge'', International edition, measures 26\u201330.</ref>\n\n:<score lang=\"lilypond\"> {\n    \\relative c' { \\time 4/4 \\key bes \\major \\tempo Allegro \\set Score.currentBarNumber = #26\n        \\bar \"\"\n        r4 bes8(\\pp bes) r4 bes8( bes) \n        r4 b8(_\\markup { \\italic sempre \\dynamic pp } b) r4 aes'8( aes) \n        r4 g8( g) r4 b,8( b) \n        r4 c8( c) a'[( bes]) bes[( bes]) \n        a( a) r4\\fermata\n    }\n}\n</score>\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n | header       = '''Recordings of tied eighth notes'''\n | filename     = Interpretation of eighth note subject of Grosse Fuge by Alban Berg quartet.ogg\n | title        = Alban Berg Quartett\n | description  = Emphasis on the first eighth note.<ref>[[Alban Berg Quartett]] (Gunter Pichler, violin, [[Gerhard Schulz (musician)|Gerhard Schulz]], violin, Thomas Kakuska, viola, Valentin Erben, cello), Recorded live at the Mozart-Saal, [[Konzerthaus, Vienna|Konzerthaus, Wien]], June 11, 1989</ref>\n | filename2     = Emerson_Quartet_playing_eighth_note_passage_of_Grosse_Fuge.ogg\n | title2        = Emerson String Quartet\n | description2  = Eighth notes are played as distinctly separate.<ref>Emerson Quartet (Eugene Drucker, violin, Philip Setzer, violin, Lawrence Dutton, viola, Paul Watkins, cello), from their album ''Ludwig van Beethoven: The Late String Quartets'' (Deutche Gramaphon, 2 May 2003)</ref>\n | filename3     = Brentano_quartet_interpretation_of_eighth_note_passage_in_Grosse_Fuge.ogg\n | title3        = Brentano String Quartet\n | description3  = Some of the eighth notes are separated, some joined.<ref>Brentano Quartet (Mark Steinberg, violin, Serena Canin, violin, Misha Amory, viola, Nina Lee, cello), recorded live in concert, Princeton University, April 2012</ref>\n}}\n\nWhat did Beethoven mean by this? Many musicologists have tried to explain: [[David Benjamin Levy|David Levy]] has written an entire article on the notation,<ref>Levy (2007)</ref> and Stephen Husarik looked to the history of Baroque [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] for an explanation.<ref>Husarik, Speck. p. 261. Husarik contends that the slur suggests a dissonant Baroque vocal figure known as \"trilletto\" which is removed and redistributed to another voice part at the end of Grosse Fuge in order to resolve long term dissonance.</ref> Performers have interpreted it in various ways. The [[Alban Berg Quartett]] plays the notes almost as a single note, but with an emphasis on the first eighth note to create a subtle differentiation. Eugene Drucker of the [[Emerson String Quartet]] plays this as two distinct eighth notes. Mark Steinberg of the [[Brentano String Quartet]] sometimes joins the eighth notes, and sometimes separates them, marking the difference by playing the first eighth without vibrato, then adding vibrato for the second. {{Clear}}\n\n==Arrangement for piano four hands==\n[[File:Grosse Fuge Manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|Manuscript of the ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dfe Fuge}}'' arranged by Beethoven for piano four hands]]\nIn early 1826, the publisher of the Op. 130 String Quartet, Mathias Artaria, told Beethoven there were \"many requests\" for a [[Duet (music)|piano four-hand]] arrangement of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge''.<ref>Solomon (1977), p. 449. Considering the unpopularity of the piece, Solomon speculates that this was a ploy to convince Beethoven to separate the fugue from the rest of op. 130.</ref> Strangely, this was well before any known discussion of publishing the fugue independently of the quartet. Artaria asked Beethoven to prepare the piano arrangement, but Beethoven was not interested, so Artaria instead asked Anton Halm to prepare it. Beethoven was not satisfied with Halm's work and subsequently made his own note-for-note arrangement of the fugue. Beethoven's arrangement was completed subsequent to the [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|C{{sharp}} minor String Quartet, Op. 131]], and was published by Artaria as Op. 134.<ref>Cooper (2008), p. 364</ref>\n\n===Rediscovery of manuscript===\nIn July 2005, an authentic 1826 Beethoven manuscript titled \"Grande Tugue [sic] \u00e0 quatre mains\" was found<ref>Wakin (2005)</ref><ref>CBC article (2005)</ref> by a librarian at the [[Palmer Theological Seminary]] in [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania]]. The manuscript was authenticated by Dr. Jeffrey Kallberg at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and Dr. Stephen Roe, head of [[Sotheby's]] Manuscript Department. This was the four-hand piano arrangement of the ''Gro\u00dfe Fuge'', Op. 134. The manuscript had been missing for 115 years. It was auctioned by Sotheby's on 1 December 2005, and bought for [[ISO 4217|GBP]] 1.12&nbsp;million (USD 1.95&nbsp;million) by a then-unknown purchaser, who has since revealed himself to be [[Bruce Kovner]], a publicity-shy multi-billionaire who donated the manuscript \u2013 along with 139 other original and rare pieces of music  \u2013 to the [[Juilliard School of Music]] in February 2006. It has since become available in Juilliard's online manuscript collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juilliardmanuscriptcollection.org/|title=The Juilliard Manuscript Collection}}</ref> The manuscript's known provenance is that it was listed in an 1890 catalogue and sold at an auction in Berlin to a [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, industrialist, whose daughter gave it and other manuscripts including a [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] ''Fantasia'' to a church in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in 1952.

By 1780, Tronjoly was recalled to France, leaving d'Orves in command with a total of six ships of the line at his disposal.<ref name=cunat83 />\n\nSuffren arrived at Isle de France on 25 October 1780.<ref name=cunat94>Cunat, p.94</ref><ref name=hennequin297>Hennequin, p.297</ref> The island had been selected as the base for French operations in the Indian Ocean, falling under the overall command of [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]].<ref name=cunat95>Cunat, p.95</ref>\n\nOn 7 December 1781, d'Orves led a 27-ship fleet to Ceylon, with his flag on ''Orient''. He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'',  ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', while other ships followed in large intervals to repeat signals and ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref> \n\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

En route, ''Art\u00e9sien'', which had originally been appointed to a shorter mission, found herself short on water, and Captain de Cardaillac requested permission to resupply at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]. Suffren gave permission but, unwilling to scatter his forces, ordered his entire squadron to move into [[Praia Harbor|Praia Harbour]]. Arriving there at 0830 the morning of 16 April, ''Art\u00e9sien'' spotted five British warship at anchor; she turned, signalling \"enemy ships in sight\". Understanding that random chance had put him in contact with [[George Johnstone (royal navy)|George Johnstone]]'s squadron,<ref name=hennequin294>Hennequin, p.294</ref> Suffren ordered an immediate attack.<ref name=cunat50>Cunat, p.50</ref> At 1000, Suffren's squadron attacked, precipitating the [[Battle of Porto Praya]].

''Charmante'' returned to Lorient to bring the news of the engagement, while the other survivors sailed on to Isle de France. By 1780, Tronjoly was recalled to France, leaving d'Orves in command with a total of six ships of the line at his disposal.<ref name=cunat83 />\n\nSuffren arrived at Isle de France on 25 October 1780.<ref name=cunat94>Cunat, p.94</ref><ref name=hennequin297>Hennequin, p.297</ref> The island had been selected as the base for French operations in the Indian Ocean, falling under the overall command of [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]].<ref name=cunat95>Cunat, p.95</ref>\n\nOn 7 December 1781, d'Orves led a 27-ship fleet to Ceylon, with his flag on ''Orient''. He had 11 ships of the line, 3 frigates and 3 corvettes at his disposal. En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'',  ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', while other ships followed in large intervals to repeat signals and ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Cristy.<ref name=cunat99>Cunat, p.99</ref> \n\nThe campaign, which Suffren now conducted against the English admiral [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]] (1720?\u20131794), is famous for the number, severity and indecisiveness of the encounters between them. Four actions took place in 1782: the [[Battle of Sadras]] on February 17, 1782, south of [[Chennai|Madras]]; the [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; the [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; and finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. Still, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

In other words, fiscal conservatives are against the government expanding beyond its means through debt, but they will usually choose debt over tax increases.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B10JkvO82x8C&pg=PA109 |title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure |first=Robert M. |last=Freeman |publisher=Elsevier |year=1999 |page=109 |isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}</ref>\n\nIn his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', [[Edmund Burke]] argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: <blockquote>[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied. [...] [T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.</blockquote>\n\n=== Factions or subgroups ===\nAlthough all fiscal conservatives agree generally on a smaller and less expensive government, there are disagreements over priorities.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} There are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis. [[Deficit hawk]]s emphasize balancing government budgets and reducing the size of government debt, viewing government debt as economically damaging and morally dubious since it passes on obligations on to future generations who have played no part in present-day tax and spending decisions.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Deficit hawks are willing to consider tax increases if the additional revenue is used to reduce debt rather than increase spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}\n\nA second group put their main emphasis on [[Tax cut#Tax cuts in the United States|tax cuts]] rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace [[supply-side economics]], arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} According to them, these additional government revenues would reduce the debt in the long term. They also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Some supply-siders have advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} However, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the [[Bush tax cuts]] added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002\u20132011<ref name=CBO_Change2012>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463 |title=CBO Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since January 2001 |publisher=CBO |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref> and it would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010\u20132019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.<ref name=CBO_2009>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753 |title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009\u20132019 |publisher=CBO |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA third group makes little distinction between debt and taxes. This group emphasizes reduction in [[Government spending|spending]] rather than tax policy or debt reduction.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}} They argue that the true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless of whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}}\n\n== History in the United States ==\n=== Early to mid 20th century ===\n{{conservatism US|schools}}\nIn the early 20th century, fiscal conservatives were often at odds with [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] who desired economic reform. During the 1920s, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s pro-business economic policies were credited for the successful period of economic growth known as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. However, his actions may have been due more to a sense of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]] than fiscal conservatism as [[Robert Sobel]] notes: \"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coolidgefoundation.org/resources/essays-papers-addresses-35/ |title=Coolidge and American Business |last=Sobel |first=Robert |publisher=Coolidge Foundation |year=1988 |accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hoover Campaign.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Hoover]] addresses a large crowd in his 1932 presidential campaign]]\nContrary to popular opinion, then-Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] was not a fiscal conservative. He promoted government intervention during the early [[Great Depression]], a policy that his successor, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], continued and increased despite campaigning to the contrary.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Coolidge's economic policies are often popularly contrasted with the [[New Deal]] deficit spending of Roosevelt and Republican Party opposition to Roosevelt's government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of Republicans through even the presidencies of [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. [[Barry Goldwater]] was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally conservative Republicans.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1977, Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed [[Alfred E. Kahn]], a professor of economics at [[Cornell University]], to be chair of the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB). He was part of a push for [[deregulation]] of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the [[Carter administration]] and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Airline Deregulation Act]] ([[Act of Congress|Pub.L.]] [http://legislink.org/us/pl-95-504 95\u2013504]) was signed into law by President Carter on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to [[Airline deregulation|remove government control]] over fares, routes and market entry of new airlines from [[commercial aviation]]. The CAB's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.<ref>Cannon, James R.; Richey, Franklin D. (2012).

This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft [[microbrew]] culture in the United States, with 3,418 micro breweries, brewpubs and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2014.<ref>[https://www.brewersassociation.org/press-releases/small-and-independent-brewers-see-sustained-growth-in-2017/ \"Small and Independent Brewers See Sustained Growth in 2017\"].

Fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical outlook of [[classical liberalism]] and [[economic liberalism]].{{sfn|Johnston|2011|p=210}} The term has its origins in the era of the [[New Deal]] during the 1930s as a result of the policies initiated by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberals]], when many classical liberals started calling themselves conservatives as they did not wish to be identified with what was passing for [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Grigsby|2004|p=99}}\n\nIn the United States, the term liberalism has become associated with the [[welfare state]] and expanded [[regulatory]] policies created as a result of the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional [[Movement conservatism|conservative movement]] that emerged during the 1950s together with [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservatism]] and [[national defense]] conservatism.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]],{{sfn|Grigsby|2004|p=100}} holding more [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] views and advocating a [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and less government spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}\n\nIn Canada, the United Kingdom and many other anglophone-speaking countries, it is associated with the Conservative parties.<ref name=\"Hoover 1987\"/><ref name=\"Rice 2010\"/>{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}}<ref name=\"Wolak 2014\"/> In Germany and other European countries, it is associated with classical or economic liberal parties.{{sfn|Johnston|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541\u2013542}}\n\n== Overview ==\n=== Principles ===\n{{economic liberalism sidebar|ideas}}\nFiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt. Fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of [[deficit spending]], the reduction of overall [[government spending]] and [[national debt]] whilst ensuring [[balanced budget]]s. In other words, fiscal conservatives are against the government expanding beyond its means through debt, but they will usually choose debt over tax increases.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B10JkvO82x8C&pg=PA109|title=Correctional Organization and Management: Public Policy Challenges, Behavior, and Structure|first=Robert M.|last=Freeman|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|page=109|isbn=978-0-7506-9897-9}}</ref>\n\nIn his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'', [[Edmund Burke]] argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer: <blockquote>[I]t is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied. [...] [T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.</blockquote>\n\n=== Factions or subgroups ===\nAlthough all fiscal conservatives agree generally on a smaller and less expensive government, there are disagreements over priorities.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} There are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis. [[Deficit hawk]]s emphasize balancing government budgets and reducing the size of government debt, viewing government debt as economically damaging and morally dubious since it passes on obligations on to future generations who have played no part in present-day tax and spending decisions.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Deficit hawks are willing to consider tax increases if the additional revenue is used to reduce debt rather than increase spending.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}}\n\nA second group put their main emphasis on [[Tax cut#Tax cuts in the United States|tax cuts]] rather than spending cuts or debt reduction. Many embrace [[supply-side economics]], arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment, tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} According to them, these additional government revenues would reduce the debt in the long term. They also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Some supply-siders have advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} However, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves. For example, the CBO estimated that the [[Bush tax cuts]] added about $1.5 trillion to deficits and debt from 2002\u20132011<ref name=CBO_Change2012>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463|title=CBO Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since January 2001|publisher=CBO|date=June 7, 2012|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref> and it would have added nearly $3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 2010\u20132019 decade if fully extended at all income levels.<ref name=CBO_2009>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009\u20132019|publisher=CBO|date=January 7, 2009|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA third group makes little distinction between debt and taxes. This group emphasizes reduction in [[Government spending|spending]] rather than tax policy or debt reduction.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}} They argue that the true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=393}} Every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from American workers, regardless of whether it is from debt or taxes. Taxes simply redistribute purchasing power, doing so in a particularly inefficient manner, reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on.{{sfn|Coates|2012|p=394}}\n\n== History in the United States ==\n=== Early to mid 20th century ===\n{{conservatism US|schools}}\nIn the early 20th century, fiscal conservatives were often at odds with [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] who desired economic reform. During the 1920s, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s pro-business economic policies were credited for the successful period of economic growth known as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. However, his actions may have been due more to a sense of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]] than fiscal conservatism as [[Robert Sobel]] notes: \"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coolidgefoundation.org/resources/essays-papers-addresses-35/|title=Coolidge and American Business|last=Sobel|first=Robert|publisher=Coolidge Foundation|year=1988|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hoover Campaign.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Hoover]] addresses a large crowd in his 1932 presidential campaign]]\nContrary to popular opinion, then-Republican President [[Herbert Hoover]] was not a fiscal conservative. He promoted government intervention during the early [[Great Depression]], a policy that his successor, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], continued and increased despite campaigning to the contrary.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Coolidge's economic policies are often popularly contrasted with the [[New Deal]] deficit spending of Roosevelt and Republican Party opposition to Roosevelt's government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of Republicans through even the presidencies of [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. [[Barry Goldwater]] was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally conservative Republicans.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn 1977, Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed [[Alfred E. Kahn]], a professor of economics at [[Cornell University]], to be chair of the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB). He was part of a push for [[deregulation]] of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the [[Carter administration]] and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe [[Airline Deregulation Act]] ([[Act of Congress|Pub.L.]] [http://legislink.org/us/pl-95-504 95\u2013504]) was signed into law by President Carter on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to [[Airline deregulation|remove government control]] over fares, routes and market entry of new airlines from [[commercial aviation]]. The CAB's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.<ref>Cannon, James R.; Richey, Franklin D. (2012).

This Carter deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft [[microbrew]] culture in the United States, with 3,418 micro breweries, brewpubs and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2014.<ref>[https://www.brewersassociation.org/press-releases/small-and-independent-brewers-see-sustained-growth-in-2017/ \"Small and Independent Brewers See Sustained Growth in 2017\"].

After Clinton's re-election in 1996, they were able to cooperate and pass the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]] which lowered the top [[capital gains tax]] rate from 28% to 20% and the 15% rate to 10%.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAfter this combination of tax hikes and spending reductions, the United States was able to create [[budget surplus]]es from fiscal years 1998\u20132001 (the first time since 1969) and the longest period of sustained [[economic growth]] in United States history.<ref name=\"President Clinton announces another record budget surplus\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/27/clinton.surplus/|title=President Clinton announces another record budget surplus|last=Wallace|first=Kelly|publisher=CNN|date=September 27, 2000|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Clinton announces record payment on national debt\">{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/05/01/clinton.debt/|title=Clinton announces record payment on national debt|last=King|first=John|publisher=CNN|date=May 1, 2000|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/02/the-budget-and-deficit-under-clinton|title=The Budget and Deficit Under Clinton|last=Jackson|first=Brooks|publisher=FactCheck|date=February 3, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern fiscal conservatism in the United States ===\n[[File:CBO Forecast Comparison - Obama and GW Bush - v1.png|thumb|450px|Comparison of annual federal deficits (CBO 10-year forecast from prior to inauguration vs. the actual amount) during the Obama and Bush presidencies showcasing how [[George W.

It means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less. It means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so, raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget, and only in combination with spending cuts. It means when you run a surplus, you save it; you don't squander it. And most importantly, being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns \u2013 and by all indications, we've got one coming.<ref name=\"Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks At 2007 Conservative Party Conference\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2007b%2Fpr348-07.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1|title=Mayor Bloomberg Delivers Remarks At 2007 Conservative Party Conference|publisher=New York City Government|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Rest of the world ==\nAs a result of the expansion of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, in the United States the term liberalism has today become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} In Western Europe, the expanded welfare states created after World War II were created by [[Socialism|socialist]] or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties such as the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] rather than liberal parties.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to [[classical liberalism]], with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] in Germany being one example.{{sfn|Fujii|2013|p=541}} The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in the United Kingdom have a [[Orange Book liberalism|classical liberal]] and a [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing of the party.
